Okay, I need to generate 10 pairs of questions and answers based on the provided context and facts about Fresno, California. Let me start by reviewing the context and the list of facts to make sure I cover different aspects.

First, the context says that Fresno is the fifth most populous city in California, incorporated in 1885, with over 542,000 residents as of the 2020 census, and it's the 34th most populous city in the US. Also, it's the seat of Fresno County. The facts include various people who were born or died in Fresno, radio stations with their transmission areas in Fresno, sports teams based there, and some geographical data like coordinates, area, and website templates.

I need to make sure each question is unique and covers different aspects. Let me list possible topics: population, incorporation date, city status, notable people, radio stations, sports teams, geographical data, and maybe some specific facts like the official website template or the type of government.

Let me start with the population and incorporation date. Then move to the city's status as the county seat. Next, mention the famous people born there. Then, radio stations and their transmission areas. Then, sports teams. Then, geographical data like coordinates, area, and maybe the type of government. Also, the official website template and the category it's part of. Also, the exact postal code or something like that.

Wait, the facts mention "correspondência exata i84248" which is a postal code. Also, "tipo de governo Strong Mayor". So that's another point. Also, the area total is given. So I can include that. Also, the model used for the wiki page. And the category it's part of.

Let me check if I have enough unique aspects. Let me try to make 10 distinct questions:

1. When was Fresno incorporated?
2. What is the population of Fresno according to the 2020 census?
3. What is the status of Fresno in terms of its county?
4. Who were some notable people born in Fresno?
5. What radio stations have their transmission area in Fresno?
6. What sports teams are based in Fresno?
7. What is the geographic coordinate of Fresno?
8. What is the total area of Fresno?
9. What is the type of government of Fresno?
10. What is the official website template used for Fresno's wiki page?

Wait, but the user said to make sure each question is different and covers different aspects. Let me check if these are all different. The first four are about incorporation, population, status, and people. Then radio stations, sports teams, coordinates, area, government type, and the wiki template. That seems okay. But I need to make sure each question is based on the facts provided. Let me check the facts again to see if these are covered.

Yes, the incorporation date is in the context. Population is given. The county seat is in the context. Notable people are in the facts. Radio stations like KRDU, KSOF, KMJ, etc., are mentioned. Sports teams include the New Mexico Lobos, Phoenix Rising FC, etc. Coordinates are in the facts. Area total is given. Government type is "Strong Mayor". The wiki template is "Template:California cities and mayors of 100,000 population" and "Template:Fresno County, California". The exact postal code is "i84248".

So I can structure the questions accordingly. Let me make sure each question is clear and the answer is directly from the facts. Also, avoid repeating similar questions. For example, instead of asking about the exact postal code, maybe ask for the exact postal code. Also, check if the user wants the answer in the same format as the example. The example had a JSON array with objects containing "pergunta" and "resposta". Each question should be in Portuguese.

So I need to translate these points into Portuguese. Let me start drafting each question and answer pair, making sure they are accurate and based on the given facts.
