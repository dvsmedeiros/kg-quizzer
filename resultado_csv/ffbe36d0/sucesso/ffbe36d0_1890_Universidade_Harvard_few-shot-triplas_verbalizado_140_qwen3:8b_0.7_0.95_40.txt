Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs based on the provided context and facts about Harvard University. Let me start by carefully reading through the given information to identify key points and details.

First, the context mentions that Harvard was founded in 1636 by the Massachusetts Assembly and named after John Harvard, its first benefactor. That's a good starting point for a question about the founder or the person after whom it's named. The answer would be John Harvard.

Next, the context states that Harvard became a coeducational institution in 1977 after merging with Radcliffe College. That's another solid question about when the graduate school became coeducational, with the answer 1977.

The text also talks about Charles W. Eliot being the rector who transformed Harvard into a modern research university after the Civil War. So a question about who transformed it into a research university would have Charles W. Eliot as the answer.

Another point is that Harvard is a member of the Ivy League, which is a notable fact. The question could be about which league it's part of, and the answer is Ivy League.

The context mentions that Harvard has 11 academic units, including ten colleges and the Radcliffe Institute. A question about the number of academic units would have 11 as the answer.

The text also states that Harvard has eight U.S. presidents as alumni. A question about how many presidents graduated from Harvard would be answered with eight.

There's information about the Harvard Library being the largest academic library in the U.S. and one of the largest in the world. A question about the largest academic library could answer with Harvard Library.

The context lists several notable alumni, like the 62 billionaires. A question about the number of billionaires associated with Harvard could have 62 as the answer.

Harvard has a campus in Cambridge and other locations like Allston and Longwood. A question about the main campus location would be Cambridge, Massachusetts.

Lastly, the text mentions that Harvard has a budget of about $30 billion as of 2012. A question about the budget could answer with $30 billion.

Now, I need to ensure that these questions are varied and cover different aspects of the context. Let me check if there are any duplicates or if I missed important facts. The example questions provided in the prompt might also help, but I need to avoid repeating them. Also, I should make sure each answer is directly inferable from the text without adding external knowledge.

Wait, the facts section lists many individuals with Harvard as their alma mater, but the context already covers some of these. Maybe I can use the fact that Harvard has 150 Nobel laureates as alumni, which is mentioned in the context. Also, the number of presidents of the U.S. is eight, which is a key point.

I need to ensure each question is unique and covers different aspects: founding, leadership, structure, alumni, campus locations, budget, etc. Let me compile these into 10 pairs, making sure each answer is correct and directly from the text.
