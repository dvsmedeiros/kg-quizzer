Okay, the user wants me to generate 10 objective questions and answers based on the context provided, which is "Jacksonville." But wait, the context given is just "Jacksonville" with no additional details. That's a bit confusing. How can I create questions about Jacksonville without specific information?

Hmm, maybe the user expects me to use general knowledge about Jacksonville. Let me think. Jacksonville is a city in Florida, USA. So I can ask about its location, population, notable features, history, or cultural aspects. But since the context is only "Jacksonville," I need to make sure the questions are based on common facts about the city.

I need to ensure that each question is unique and covers different aspects. Let me list possible topics: location, population, famous landmarks, history, sports teams, cultural events, economy, geography, climate, and maybe something about the name. Wait, the name "Jacksonville" might have a historical origin. Let me check that.

Jacksonville is named after a person, but I'm not sure. Maybe the original name was something else. Wait, the city was originally called "Jacksonville" after a local leader named Jackson, but I need to confirm that. Alternatively, it might be named after a different person. Let me recall. I think the city was named after William Jackson, a local leader. So that's a point.

Also, the city is known for its beaches, the Jacksonville Beaches, and the St. Johns River. The population is around 900,000. The economy is based on tourism, fishing, and manufacturing. The major sports teams are the Jacksonville Jaguars and the Jacksonville Sharks. The city is in Duval County, Florida. The climate is subtropical, with warm weather year-round.

I can create questions on each of these points. Let me make sure not to repeat the same topics. For example, one question about location, another about population, another about the river, another about the name, another about the economy, another about sports teams, another about the climate, another about the beaches, another about the county, and another about the name's origin.

Wait, but the user said to base the questions strictly on the provided context. Since the context is just "Jacksonville," I have to assume that the user expects me to use general knowledge. But maybe the user made a mistake in the context. However, since I have to proceed, I'll use standard facts about Jacksonville.

Let me start drafting the questions and answers, making sure each is unique and covers different aspects. Check for repetition and ensure each answer is correct based on known facts.
