Okay, so I need to generate 10 question-response pairs based on the given context about Peste Negra. Let me start by understanding what Peste Negra is. From what I remember, it's a historical event, specifically the Black Death that occurred in Europe during the 14th century.

First, I should break down the content provided into key points to make sure each question covers different aspects. The context mentions when it happened (mid-14th century), its impact on population (reduction by half), the cause (bacterium Yersinia pestis), transmission methods (fleas and rats leading to bubonic plague, cough for pneumonic), symptoms (swollen lymph nodes called buboes, fever, etc.), prevention strategies (quarantine, isolation), and famous works influenced by it like Boccaccio's Decameron.

I need to create varied questions that touch on each of these aspects without repeating similar ones. Let me list potential areas:

1. **Time period**: When did the Black Death occur?
2. **Impact on population**: How many people died?
3. **Cause**: What was the cause of the disease?
4. **Transmission methods**: How was it spread?
5. **Symptoms**: What were the symptoms?
6. **Prevention**: What measures were taken to control it?
7. **Cultural impact**: Name a literary work influenced by it.
8. **Specific effects**: Which social groups were most affected?
9. **Geographical spread**: How did it affect trade and movement?
10. **Historical significance**: Why is it significant in history?

Wait, the context provided doesn't mention specific social groups but focuses on population reduction. So maybe adjust that.

Now, making sure each question is unique and covers different aspects:

1. When did Peste Negra occur? (mid-14th century)
2. How many people died? (about half)
3. What caused it? (Yersinia pestis)
4. How was it transmitted? (fleas, rats for bubonic; cough for pneumonic)
5. What were the main symptoms? (buboes, fever)
6. What measures were taken to prevent spread? (quarantine, isolation)
7. Name a literary work influenced by it. (Decameron)
8. Which part of Europe was most affected? (Italy, according to Boccaccio's origin)
9. How did the population decrease affect society? (labour shortages, social changes)
10. What was the disease's primary form? (bubonic)

I think these cover a broad range without overlap. Now, I need to frame them as questions and provide correct answers based on the context.
