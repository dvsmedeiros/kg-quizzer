Okay, I need to generate 10 objective question-answer pairs based on the provided context and facts. Let me start by understanding the given information.

The context explains that civil disobedience is a peaceful protest against unjust laws or oppressive governments, originally by Henry David Thoreau and used by Gandhi, MLK, etc. The facts list various events and movements that used civil disobedience, like the 1998 Russian miners' strike, 2015 Montenegrin crisis, etc. Also, there are references to specific events and people associated with civil disobedience.

The user wants 10 questions, each with a unique and relevant answer, all in Portuguese. The examples given include questions about definitions, examples of movements, historical events, and key figures.

First, I should ensure that the questions cover different aspects: definition, historical examples, key figures, methods, and specific events. Let me check the facts again to find different events and people. For example, the examples include the 2019 Montenegrin anti-corruption protests, the 2017 Serbian protests, the 2021 End SARS memorial protest, etc.

I need to avoid repeating similar questions. The examples provided in the user's message include questions about the definition, examples of movements, key figures, and specific events. I should make sure my questions are varied and cover different events and aspects.

Let me start by creating a question about the definition. The example already has one, but maybe rephrase it. Then, ask about the origin, the key figures like Thoreau, Gandhi, MLK. Then, specific events like the 2019 Montenegrin protests, the 2021 End SARS, etc. Also, maybe ask about the purpose or methods of civil disobedience.

I should check the facts for different events. The list includes events in Russia, Montenegro, Albania, Serbia, St. Louis, Iran, etc. Also, there's the Aboriginal Tent Embassy, Assam Movement, etc.

Another angle is the purpose of civil disobedience, like fighting against unjust laws. Also, the methods used, like protests, strikes, etc.

I need to make sure each question is unique and not repeating the same event or aspect. Let me list possible questions:

1. Definition of civil disobedience.
2. Who is considered the originator of the concept?
3. Which historical movement is known for using civil disobedience in India?
4. What is an example of a modern protest using civil disobedience?
5. What was the purpose of the 2019 Montenegrin anti-corruption protests?
6. Which event in the US is associated with civil disobedience?
7. What is the main goal of civil disobedience?
8. Who was a key figure in the civil disobedience movement in the US?
9. What method was used in the 2017 Serbian protests?
10. What is the main focus of the 2015 Montenegrin crisis?

Wait, but some of these might be overlapping. Let me check the facts again. The facts mention the 2019 Montenegrin anti-corruption protests, 2017 Serbian protests, 2021 End SARS, 2015 Montenegrin crisis, etc. Also, the examples given in the user's sample include the 2004 Orange Revolution in Ukraine, the 2003 Rose Revolution in Georgia, but those are not in the current facts. However, the current facts include the 1998 Russian miners' strike, 2015 Montenegrin crisis, 2017 Serbian protests, etc.

I need to ensure that the questions are based on the facts provided. Let me make sure each answer is from the given data. Also, the user's examples have answers like "esobediência civil" for the definition, "apartheid" for an example in South Africa, but in the current facts, the example is the 2019 Montenegrin anti-corruption protests, so I need to adjust accordingly.

Wait, the user's sample includes an example where the answer is "apartheid," but in the current facts, there's no mention of apartheid. However, the user's own examples might be outdated. But the user's instruction says to use the provided facts. So I need to stick to the facts provided in the query, not the examples. So in the current facts, the examples include the 1998 Russian miners' strike, 2015 Montenegrin crisis, 2017 Serbian protests, 1998 Russian miners' strike, etc.

So, the questions should be based on the provided facts. Let me start drafting the questions:

1. Qual é a definição de desobediência civil?
   Resposta: ação de resistência não violenta contra leis consideradas injustas.

2. Quem é considerado o principal criador do conceito de desobediência civil?
   Resposta: Henry David Thoreau.

3. Qual movimento é associado à luta pela independência na Índia?
   Resposta: movimento de Gandhi.

4. Qual evento moderno utilizou a desobediência civil?
   Resposta: 2019 Montenegrin anti-corruption protests.

5. O que é o objetivo da desobediência civil?
   Resposta: protestar contra leis injustas e governos opressivos.

6. Qual evento em 2017 envolveu protestos com desobediência civil?
   Resposta: protestos em Sérvia.

7. Qual evento no Brasil está relacionado à desobediência civil?
   Resposta: 2019 Montenegrin anti-corruption protests (wait, that's in Montenegro, not Brazil. Maybe another event? The facts mention the 1998 Russian miners' strike, but that's in Russia. Maybe the user's example had the Orange Revolution in Ukraine, but that's not in the facts. Hmm.)

Wait, the facts provided include events in Russia, Montenegro, Serbia, etc. So maybe the answer for the question about Brazil is not present. Alternatively, maybe the user's example is outdated, but I need to follow the given facts. So maybe I need to adjust.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is the 2015 Montenegrin crisis. But the question is about Brazil. Wait, the user's examples have a question about the 2004 Orange Revolution in Ukraine, but in the current facts, there's no mention of Ukraine. So perhaps I should avoid that. Let me check again.

The facts mention the 1998 Russian miners' strike, 2015 Montenegrin crisis, 2017 Serbian protests, 2019 Montenegrin anti-corruption protests, 2021 End SARS, etc. So maybe the answer for the question about Brazil is not available. Alternatively, maybe the answer is the 2019 Montenegrin anti-corruption protests. But that's not in Brazil. Hmm. Maybe the question is about the 2017 Serbian protests, which is in Serbia, not Brazil. Alternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake, but I have to work with the given facts.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is the 2019 Montenegrin anti-corruption protests, which is in Montenegro, but the question is about Brazil. Maybe the user's example is incorrect, but I need to follow the facts provided. So perhaps the answer is not available, but I need to create a question that is based on the facts.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is the 2015 Montenegrin crisis, but that's in Montenegro. Maybe the user's examples are not aligned with the current facts. So I need to make sure each question is based on the facts given.

Let me try again. Maybe the answer for the question about Brazil is not present, so perhaps the question is about another country. Alternatively, maybe the answer is the 2019 Montenegrin anti-corruption protests, even though the question is about Brazil. But that's incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the 2017 Serbian protests, which is in Serbia. But the user's example had a question about Brazil, but in the current facts, there's no mention of Brazil. So maybe the answer is not present. Therefore, I need to avoid that.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is the 2015 Montenegrin crisis, which is in Montenegro. So the question could be: "Onde ocorreu a crise em 2015 que utilizou desobediência civil?" and the answer is "Montenegro."

So, perhaps that's the way to go. Let me adjust.

So, the 10 questions would be:

1. Qual é a definição de desobediência civil?
   Resposta: ação de resistência não violenta contra leis consideradas injustas.

2. Quem é considerado o principal criador do conceito de desobediência civil?
   Resposta: Henry David Thoreau.

3. Qual movimento é associado à luta pela independência na Índia?
   Resposta: movimento de Gandhi.

4. Qual evento moderno utilizou a desobediência civil?
   Resposta: 2019 Montenegrin anti-corruption protests.

5. O que é o objetivo da desobediência civil?
   Resposta: protestar contra leis injustas e governos opressivos.

6. Qual evento em 2017 envolveu protestos com desobediência civil?
   Resposta: protestos em Sérvia.

7. Qual evento ocorreu em 2015 no Montenegro que utilizou desobediência civil?
   Resposta: crise de 2015.

8. Quem foi um dos líderes na luta contra o apartheid nos EUA?
   Resposta: Martin Luther King Jr.

9. Qual é um exemplo de desobediência civil em uma região de África?
   Resposta: 2019 Montenegrin anti-corruption protests (wait, that's in Montenegro, not Africa. Maybe another event? The facts mention the 1998 Russian miners' strike, but that's in Russia. Maybe the answer is the 2015 Montenegrin crisis, which is in Europe. Hmm. This is a problem.)

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is the 2019 Montenegrin anti-corruption protests, even though it's in Europe. But the question is about Africa. Maybe the user's example is incorrect, but I have to work with the given facts. So perhaps the answer is not available, but I need to create a question that is based on the facts.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is the 2015 Montenegrin crisis, but that's not in Africa. So this is a problem. Maybe the user made a mistake in the example, but I need to proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is the 2019 Montenegrin anti-corruption protests, even though the question is about Africa. But that's not correct. Maybe the question is about another country. Alternatively, maybe the answer is the 2017 Serbian protests, which is in Europe. So the question might be "Qual evento em 2017 utilizou desobediência civil em uma região europeia?" and the answer is "protestos em Sérvia."

But the user's example had a question about Brazil, which is not in the facts. So I need to adjust.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is the 1998 Russian miners' strike, which is in Russia. So the question could be: "Qual evento em 1998 utilizou desobediência civil em uma região da Rússia?" and the answer is "miners' strike."

But I need to make sure the questions are based on the facts. So maybe that's acceptable.

So, let me rework the questions:

1. Qual é a definição de desobediência civil?
   Resposta: ação de resistência não violenta contra leis consideradas injustas.

2. Quem é considerado o principal criador do conceito de desobediência civil?
   Resposta: Henry David Thoreau.

3. Qual movimento é associado à luta pela independência na Índia?
   Resposta: movimento de Gandhi.

4. Qual evento moderno utilizou a desobediência civil?
   Resposta: 2019 Montenegrin anti-corruption protests.

5. O que é o objetivo da desobediência civil?
   Resposta: protestar contra leis injustas e governos opressivos.

6. Qual evento em 2017 envolveu protestos com desobediência civil?
   Resposta: protestos em Sérvia.

7. Qual evento ocorreu em 2015 no Montenegro que utilizou desobediência civil?
   Resposta: crise de 2015.

8. Quem foi um dos líderes na luta contra o apartheid nos EUA?
   Resposta: Martin Luther King Jr.

9. Qual evento em 1998 utilizou desobediência civil na Rússia?
   Resposta: mineração strike.

10. Qual é um exemplo de desobediência civil em uma região da Europa?
    Resposta: 2017 protestos em Sérvia.

This way, the questions are based on the facts provided, even if some answers are in Europe or Russia. The user's example might have had a mistake, but I need to follow the given facts. So this should be acceptable.
