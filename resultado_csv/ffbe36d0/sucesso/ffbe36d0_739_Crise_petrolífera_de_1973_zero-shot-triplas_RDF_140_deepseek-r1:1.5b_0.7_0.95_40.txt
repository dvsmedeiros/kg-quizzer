Okay, I need to create exactly 10 pairs of questions and answers based on the provided context about the 1973 oil crisis. Each question should be relevant, and each answer must be correct and explicitly or implicitly correct.

First, I'll review the context given:

The oil crisis began in September 1973 when OPAEP declared a embargo on Israel's NETA members. The embargo affected member countries like Canada, Japan, Germany, the USA, etc., including their U.S. prices rising. It caused a crash and became the first energy crisis since the Vietnam War.

Now, I'll think about different aspects of this event to create questions.

1. **Impact on Fuel Prices**: How did the oil prices affect global fuel costs? The answer would be an increase from US$3 to near $12 per barrel.
   
2. **Economic Crises in 1973**: Which country experienced a severe economic crisis due to the oil price crash?

3. **Global Economic Impact**: What was the global effect on economies, especially in Europe and North America.

4. **Government Response**: How did the United States respond during the crisis? They saw significant surges in prices post- embargo.

5. **Newspaper Headlines**: A notable article about the oil price crash by a women's newspaper heading for a community discussion.

6. **Crisis Name**: The specific term used to refer to this event.

7. **International Organizations' Roles**: Which organizations like OPAEP and OIE were involved in addressing the crisis.

8. **Global Energy Crisis**: How did it impact global energy supplies, especially in Asia?

9. **Technological Impact**: What technological advancements led to increased oil prices? Maybe automation or blending.

10. **Resilience of Nations**: Which nations were least affected by the crisis?

Now, I'll structure each question with a clear focus and provide the corresponding answer, ensuring they align with the context provided.
