Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs based on the provided context and facts about the Scottish Parliament. Let me read through the context carefully to understand the key points.

First, the Scottish Parliament is unicameral and located in Holyrood, Edinburgh. It has 129 MSPs elected every four years using a mixed member proportional system. The last election was on May 5, 2016, but there's also mention of an election on May 6, 2021, which might be the most recent one.

The Parliament was established in 1999 after the 1998 Scotland Act. It has various committees and handles different policy areas like Education, Energy, etc. The current Presiding Officer is Alison Johnstone.

Looking at the facts provided, there are details about constituencies, electoral regions, committees, election dates, and more. I need to create varied questions that cover these aspects without repetition.

I should ensure each question has a clear, correct answer from the context. Let me start drafting some questions:

1. When was the last general election for the Scottish Parliament? - May 6, 2021
2. How many MSPs are there in total? - 129
3. What is the term length for MSPs? - Four years
4. Which electoral system is used? - Mixed member proportional system
5. How many committees does the Parliament have? - The context mentions several, but it's not specified as a number.
Wait, maybe better to ask about one of the committees: Which committee oversees transport and climate change? - Transport, Climate Change, and Environment

Alternatively, another approach:

1. Where is the Scottish Parliament located? - Holyrood, Edinburgh
2. How many MSPs represent geographical districts? - 73
3. How many are regional representatives? - 52
4. When was the current Parliament established? - 1998 Scotland Act
5. Who is the current Presiding Officer? - Alison Johnstone

I can continue this process, ensuring each question is unique and covers different aspects like structure, elections, leaders, committees, etc.

Let me make sure to vary the types of questions: some about numbers, locations, people, functions, dates, etc. Also, check for any specific details in the facts that can form a good Q&A pair.

After drafting 10 pairs, I'll review them to ensure they're clear, each has one correct answer, and there's no overlap in topics.
