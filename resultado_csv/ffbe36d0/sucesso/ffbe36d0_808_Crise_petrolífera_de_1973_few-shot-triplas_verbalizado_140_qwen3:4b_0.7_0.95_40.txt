Okay, I need to generate 10 objective questions and answers based on the provided context and facts about the 1973 oil crisis. Let me start by carefully reading through the given context and facts to make sure I understand all the key points.

The context mentions that the crisis started in October 1973 when OPEC members imposed an embargo on countries supporting Israel during the Yom Kippur War. The embargo affected countries like Canada, Japan, the Netherlands, the UK, and the US, expanding later to Portugal, Rhodesia, and South Africa. The oil price increased from $3 to around $12 per barrel, with even higher prices in the US. This caused a "oil shock," affecting global politics and economy, known as the first oil shock, followed by the 1979 crisis as the second.

The facts provided include various categories, templates, images, and other attributes, but the main content is in the context. The examples given by the user include questions about the start date, price changes, terms like "first oil shock," the embargo's cause, and specific events like Nixon's negotiations and Kissinger's withdrawal.

I need to ensure that the questions I create are varied and cover different aspects. Let me list possible topics: start date, embargo countries, price changes, terms used, causes, effects on specific countries, Nixon's actions, Kissinger's role, the duration of the embargo, and the economic impact.

Wait, the user's example has questions about the start date, price in March 1974, the second shock, the term "first oil shock," the embargo's proclamers, the reason for separation of European and Japanese countries, Nixon's negotiations, Kissinger's withdrawal date, when the embargo was lifted, and when the US left Bretton Woods. However, the Bretton Woods part isn't in the context, so maybe that's a mistake. But the user's example includes that, so maybe that's a fact from the provided facts, but in the context given, it's not mentioned. However, the user's instructions say to generate based on the context and facts provided, so I need to check if that's included.

Looking back, the facts include things like "1973 oil crisis usa modelo de página wiki Template:Clarify" etc., but the actual content is in the context. The example includes a question about the US leaving Bretton Woods, which is not in the context. That might be an error, but since the user provided that example, maybe that's a fact from the facts section. Wait, the facts list includes "1973 oil crisis usa modelo de página wiki Template:Use mdy dates" but not the Bretton Woods part. So perhaps that's an error in the example. But the user's instruction says to generate based on the context and facts. Therefore, I need to make sure that the questions are based on the context and the facts provided, not on external knowledge.

So, the user's example includes a question about the US leaving Bretton Woods, but that's not in the context. However, the facts list includes "1973 oil crisis possui data July 2022" which is probably a mistake, but maybe that's unrelated. Wait, the facts list is a list of attributes, which might be in Portuguese, but the actual content is in the context. So, I need to focus on the context and the facts as given. The user's example may have incorrect information, but I should follow the instructions strictly.

So, the context is the main source. The facts are attributes that might not be directly relevant to the questions. Therefore, the questions should be based on the context. The example provided by the user includes some questions that are not in the context. For example, the question about the US leaving Bretton Woods is not mentioned in the context. However, the user's instruction says to generate based on the context and facts. Therefore, I need to make sure that the questions are only based on the context and the facts provided. Wait, the facts are in Portuguese, but they are attributes like "1973 oil crisis é do tipo YagoPermanentlyLocatedEntity", which might not be directly relevant. However, the user's example includes a question about the US leaving Bretton Woods, which is not in the context. Therefore, perhaps that's an error. But the user's instruction says to generate based on the context and facts. Therefore, I need to make sure that the questions are based on the context and the facts provided. However, the facts are in Portuguese and might not be directly useful. Therefore, the main source is the context, and the facts might be additional information that could be used, but I need to check if any of the facts are relevant.

For example, the facts include "1973 oil crisis possui assunto Category:1973 in economics" which might not be a question. However, the user's example includes a question about the first oil shock, which is in the context. So, the key is to base the questions on the context and the facts provided, even if the facts are in Portuguese. However, the user's example includes questions that are not in the context, so maybe the facts are not to be considered. The user's instruction says to generate based on the context and facts provided. Therefore, the facts might include some information that can be used, but the main content is in the context. So, I need to focus on the context and the facts that are in the context.

Wait, the context says that the embargo was directed at countries seen as supporting Israel. The facts include "1973 oil crisis usa modelo de página wiki Template:Use mdy dates" but that's not helpful. The example questions are based on the context. So, the user's example includes questions that are in the context, but the user's own example includes a question about the US leaving Bretton Woods, which is not in the context. However, the user's example is provided as an example, but the user's instruction says to generate based on the context and facts. Therefore, perhaps the user's example is incorrect, but I need to follow the given context and facts. Therefore, I should create questions based on the context and the facts, even if some of the facts are not in the context. Wait, the facts are in Portuguese, but they are attributes. For example, "1973 oil crisis é do tipo YagoPermanentlyLocatedEntity" which is probably a category, but not relevant. Therefore, the main source is the context. So, the questions should be based on the context.

So, possible questions:

1. When did the 1973 oil crisis start?
2. Which countries were affected by the embargo?
3. What was the price of oil in March 1974?
4. What was the term used for the first oil shock?
5. Who proclaimed the oil embargo?
6. Why did European and Japanese countries separate from the US?
7. What was the result of Nixon's negotiations?
8. When was the embargo lifted?
9. What was the economic impact of the crisis?
10. What was the name of the second oil shock?

Wait, but the example already has similar questions. Let me check the context again. The context says that the embargo was directed at countries supporting Israel, and the oil price increased. The example includes questions about the start date, price, first shock, embargo proclamers, the reason for separation, Nixon's negotiations, Kissinger's withdrawal date, when the embargo was lifted, and when the US left Bretton Woods. However, the latter is not in the context. Therefore, perhaps the user's example is incorrect, but the user's instruction is to generate based on the context and facts. Therefore, I need to focus on the context. The facts may not be relevant, but the context is the main source. Therefore, the questions should be based on the context. Let me make sure that the questions I generate are based on the context and the facts that are in the context.

So, the 10 questions would be:

1. When did the 1973 oil crisis begin?
2. Which countries were targeted by the oil embargo?
3. What was the price of oil in March 1974?
4. What was the term used to describe the first oil shock?
5. Who proclaimed the oil embargo?
6. What was the reason for the separation of European and Japanese countries from the US?
7. What was the result of Nixon's negotiations?
8. When was the embargo lifted?
9. What was the economic impact of the crisis?
10. What was the name of the second oil shock?

But I need to check if these questions are in the context. The context says that the embargo started in October 1973, affecting countries like Canada, Japan, Netherlands, UK, US, and later others. The price increased from $3 to $12. The first shock is mentioned. The embargo was proclaimed by OPEC members. The separation is because they wanted to avoid being targeted. Nixon's negotiations led to Israel withdrawing from Sinai and Golan. The embargo was lifted in March 1974. The economic impact is mentioned as the "oil shock." The second shock is in 1979. So these questions are based on the context. Therefore, these are valid.

But the user's example includes a question about the US leaving Bretton Woods, which is not in the context. However, the user's example might be incorrect. Therefore, I should focus on the context. So, the 10 questions would be the ones I listed above, but I need to check for any possible errors. Also, the user's example has 10 questions, and I need to make sure that the answers are accurate based on the context. Therefore, the answer for the second question is the list of countries mentioned in the context: Canada, Japan, Netherlands, UK, US, and later others. The answer for the sixth question is to avoid being targeted. The answer for the seventh question is the withdrawal of Israel from Sinai and Golan. The answer for the eighth question is March 1974. The answer for the tenth question is 1979. The answer for the fourth question is "first oil shock." The answer for the third question is "quase US $ 12" as in the example. The answer for the first question is October 1973. The answer for the fifth question is members of OPEC. The answer for the ninth question is the "oil shock" affecting global politics and economy.

I need to make sure that the answers are in the same format as the example, using the correct terms. Therefore, the 10 questions and answers would be as follows.
