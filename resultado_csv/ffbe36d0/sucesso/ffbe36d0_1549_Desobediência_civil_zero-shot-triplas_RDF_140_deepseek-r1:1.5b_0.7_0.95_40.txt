Okay, so I need to create 10 pairs of questions and answers based on the given context and facts. Let me start by understanding what each part entails.

First, the context talks about various civil disobedience movements across different countries, including Russia, Russia's earlier versions, various Balkan countries, Serbia, Romania, Ireland, Poland, Italy, Sweden, Montenegro, Ukraine, Poland again, and the U.N. The facts provided include specific events from these contexts that can be turned into questions.

Looking at the context, I see mentions of the Russian Civil Disobedition Movement (1980s), the Montenegrin Crisis in 2015–2016, the Albanian and Serbian movements, the Serbian Protests, the Serbians' movement, the 2017 Albanic,anian, Serbs, and Croats movement, the 2018–2019 Iranian Crisis, the Euler Protest in 2019, the Montenegrin Episcopal Convention Protests in 2021, the 2021 Upcoming Memorial Test Protests, the 2021 Uptown Minneapolis Unrest, the 2021 Montenegro Movement, the Aboriginal Embassy in Russia, the Assam movement, an8th grade Lgbt protest in Poland, a LGBT+ protest in Chicago (Gwangju), and Billy Hur's egg-throwing incident.

Now, I need to create questions that are clear and relevant to these events. Each question should have a unique answer based on the context provided. Let me think of some possible angles for each event:

1. Russian Civil Disobedition Movement: What motivated this movement? How did it spread?
2. Montenegrin Crisis in 2015-2016: Who was involved, and what was their goal?
3. Albanian Protests: Why were they started? What kind of actions did they take to protest?
4. Serbian Protests: Similar questions about the specifics.
5. Euler Protest: Details on the issues raised by the movement.
6. Montenegrin Episcopal Conventions: What happened in 2021, and what's it about?
7. 2021 Upping Memorial Test Protests: Who led them? What was their main issue?
8. Montenegro Movement: Specific actions taken to protest the government.
9. Aboriginal Embassy: Why support this movement? Any challenges faced?
10. Assam Movement: What caused it and what were its key points?

I need to make sure each question is clear, uses relevant facts from the context, and has a unique answer that can be answered accurately.

Let me draft some questions based on these thoughts:

1. What motivated the 2015–2016 Russian Civil Disobedition Movement? How did it spread?
2. Who was involved in the Montenegrin Crisis in 2015–2016, and what were their goals?
3. Why did the Albanian Protests take place, and what kind of actions did they involve?
4. What were the specifics of the Serbian Protests? What issues did they address?
5. What was the Euler movement about in 2018–2019? What sparked it?
6. In 2021, what significant Episcopal Conventions led to the Upping Memorial Test Protests? What's their purpose?
7. Who led the Montenegrin Episcopal Conventions in 2021, and what was the main issue they discussed?
8. How did Montenegro respond to the government's policies during their movement? Were there any challenges they faced?
9. Why support the Aboriginal Embassy Movement? Are there any advocacy issues facing it?
10. What caused the Assam Movement in 2021, and what were its key actions?

Now, I'll structure each pair with a question followed by a plausible answer based on the facts provided.
