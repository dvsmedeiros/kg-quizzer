Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs based on the given context and facts. Let me start by understanding the content provided.

The context talks about EU laws as a system of rules in EU member states. It mentions the post-WWII foundation of the European Coal and Steel Community, the EU's goal to promote peace, values, and well-being, and the existence of political, social, and economic institutions that transcend national states. The EU's Court of Justice is noted as representing a new international legal order.

The facts provided are in RDF format, which seems to reference resources related to EU law, scholars like Henry G. Schermers and John Bell, and academic disciplines. The examples given in the user's message include questions about the definition of EU law, primary sources, secondary sources, legislative bodies, effects on member states' laws, and the three main sources of EU law.

Now, I need to create 10 unique questions that cover different aspects of the context and facts. Let me brainstorm possible questions:

1. What is the main objective of the EU according to the context?
2. Which organization represents the new international legal order of the EU?
3. What are the three main sources of EU law?
4. Who are some notable scholars in EU law?
5. What is the role of the EU's Court of Justice?
6. What is the significance of the Treaty of Rome in EU law?
7. How does EU law affect member states' national laws?
8. What is the primary legal basis for the EU's existence?
9. What are the key institutions involved in EU legislation?
10. What is the academic discipline focused on EU law?

Wait, some of these might overlap with the examples provided. Let me check the examples again. The examples have questions about the three sources, primary sources, legislative bodies, effects on member states, etc. So I need to ensure that the new questions are different but still relevant.

Let me adjust:

1. What is the main objective of the EU as stated in the context?
2. Which institution is responsible for interpreting EU law?
3. What are the three main categories of EU law sources?
4. What is the historical origin of the EU's legal framework?
5. How does the EU's legal system transcend national states?
6. What is the role of the Treaty of Rome in the EU's legal structure?
7. What is the effect of EU law on national laws of member states?
8. What are the primary legal instruments that form the EU's legal basis?
9. Which bodies are part of the EU's legislative authority?
10. What is the academic field dedicated to studying EU law?

Now, I need to ensure that each answer is directly inferable from the context or facts. For example, the answer to question 1 would be "promover a paz, seus valores e o bem-estar de seus povos." The Court of Justice is mentioned as representing the new legal order, so that's the answer for question 2. The three sources are primary, secondary, and complementary. The historical origin is the European Coal and Steel Community. The legal system transcends national states through institutions. The Treaty of Rome is part of the primary sources. The effect on national laws is direct or indirect. The primary legal instruments are the treaties. The legislative bodies are the Parliament and Council. The academic field is Law of the European Union.

I need to check for repetition and ensure all answers are correct based on the context. Also, make sure the questions are varied and not redundant. Let me compile the 10 pairs now.
