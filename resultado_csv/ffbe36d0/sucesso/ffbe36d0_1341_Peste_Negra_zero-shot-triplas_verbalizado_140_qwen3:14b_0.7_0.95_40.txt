Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs based on the provided context and facts. Let me start by reading through the context carefully to understand the key points. The Black Death, also known as the Great Plague, was the most devastating pandemic in human history, killing 75-200 million people in Eurasia, peaking in Europe between 1347-1351. It's caused by Yersinia pestis, with bubonic being the most common form. The origin is believed to be Central or East Asia, spreading via the Silk Road, then through rats and fleas on Genoese merchant ships. It caused significant social, religious, and economic upheaval, reducing Europe's population by 30-60%, and the world population from 475 million to 350-375 million in the 14th century. Recovery took about 200 years, with some regions like Florence recovering only in the 19th century. The plague returned in outbreaks until the early 20th century.

Now, looking at the facts provided, there's a lot of technical information, like models used in Wikipedia pages, specific people involved (Sharon N. DeWitte, Ole Jørgen Benedictow), images, categories, and other details. But the user wants questions based on the context and facts, not the technical Wikipedia models. So I should focus on the context first and then check the facts for any additional relevant info that's not in the context but is in the facts.

First, I can ask about the estimated number of deaths. The context says 75-200 million. Then the time period in Europe (1347-1351). The cause (Yersinia pestis). The most common form (bubonic). Origin (Central or East Asia). How it spread (via rats and fleas on ships). Impact on Europe's population (30-60% mortality). Recovery time (200 years). The return of the plague until the early 20th century. Also, the reduction of world population from 475 million to 350-375 million.

From the facts, there's info about Sharon N. DeWitte's interests, Ole Jørgen Benedictow's work, the number of deaths (75,000,000), the spread map (1346-1353), and some images. But the user wants questions based on the context and facts. However, the context already covers the main points, so maybe the facts are for more specific details. But the user said to use the context and facts, but the answer must be based on the content provided. So I need to make sure that the questions are answerable from either the context or the facts, but not adding information not present.

Wait, the user said: "Gere pares de perguntas e respostas relevantes e corretas, exclusivamente a partir do conteúdo fornecido." So all answers must come from the context or facts provided. So I need to check both the context and the facts for possible questions.

For example, the fact mentions "Black Death possui número de mortes 75000000" which is 75 million, while the context says 75-200 million. But the context is more general. So the user might prefer the context's range, but the fact gives a specific number. However, the user's instruction says to use the content provided, so maybe the fact's 75 million is part of the content. But the context says 75-200 million. So which is correct? The user might expect the answer to be from the context unless the fact provides more precise data.

But in the context, it's stated that "a morte de 75 a 200 milhões de pessoas na Eurásia", so the range is 75-200 million. The fact says "número de mortes 75000000", which is 75 million. So there's a discrepancy here. But the user wants answers based on the content. Since the context is more comprehensive, maybe the answer should be the context's range. But the fact gives a specific number. However, the user might expect the answer to be based on the context unless the fact is more precise. But since both are part of the content, I need to check if the question can be answered either way. However, the user's instruction says to use the content, so maybe the answer should be based on the context's range. Alternatively, maybe the fact is a specific part of the content, so the answer is 75 million. But the context says 75-200 million. Which is more accurate? Well, the context is a general overview, and the fact might be a specific figure. But since the user wants the answer to be from the content, I have to use both. However, the user's example in the context says 75-200 million, which is the same as the fact's 75 million as a lower bound. So maybe the answer is 75-200 million.

Another point: the fact mentions "Black Death possui assunto Category:Second plague pandemic", so a question could be about which pandemic the Black Death is part of, answer: Second plague pandemic.

Also, the fact says "Black Death possui assunto Category:1350s in Asia", but the context mentions origin in Asia. However, the user wants the answer based on the content, so the category might be part of the answer. But the context says the origin is Central or East Asia, so that's more relevant.

I need to make sure that each question is unique and covers different aspects. Let me list possible questions:

1. What is the estimated number of deaths caused by the Black Death in Eurasia?
   - Answer: Between 75 to 200 million people.

2. Which bacterium is believed to have caused the Black Death?
   - Answer: Yersinia pestis.

3. What is the most common form of the plague caused by Yersinia pestis?
   - Answer: Bubonic.

4. Where is the origin of the Black Death believed to be?
   - Answer: Central or East Asia.

5. How did the Black Death spread to Europe?
   - Answer: Through rats and fleas on Genoese merchant ships via the Silk Road.

6. What percentage of Europe's population is estimated to have died due to the Black Death?
   - Answer: Between 30% to 60%.

7. How long did it take for Europe's population to recover after the Black Death?
   - Answer: Approximately 200 years.

8. In which years did the Black Death reach its peak in Europe?
   - Answer: Between 1347 and 1351.

9. What was the impact of the Black Death on the world population in the 14th century?
   - Answer: The population decreased from 475 million to 350-375 million.

10. Which category is the Black Death associated with in terms of historical events?
    - Answer: The Second plague pandemic.

But wait, the user might not want questions about the category. Let me check the facts again. The facts mention several categories like "Category:Black Death", "Category:Plague pandemics", "Category:Eurasian history", etc. So a question about which category the Black Death is associated with could be answered with "Plague pandemics" or "Second plague pandemic".

However, the user might prefer questions that are more about the content rather than the categorization. So maybe focus on the context's main points and the facts' specific data.

Another possible question: What is the name of the most common form of the plague caused by Yersinia pestis? Answer: Bubonic.

Also, the fact mentions "Black Death possui assunto Category:1350s in Europe", but the context says the peak was in 1347-1351. So a question about the time period.

I think the first 10 questions I listed are good. Now I need to ensure that each answer comes from the context or facts. For example, the answer "75-200 million" comes from the context, "Yersinia pestis" from context, "bubonic" from context, "Central or East Asia" from context, "rats and fleas on Genoese merchant ships" from context, "30-60%" from context, "200 years" from context, "1347-1351" from context, "population decreased from 475 million to 350-375 million" from context, and "Second plague pandemic" from the fact.

But the user might not want the category questions. Alternatively, the fact says "Black Death possui assunto Category:Black Death", which is redundant. So maybe not useful for a question. Another fact is "Black Death está localizado em Eurasia and North Africa", which could be a question about where it was located. Answer: Eurasia and North Africa.

So that's another possible question. Let me adjust the list accordingly:

1. What is the estimated number of deaths caused by the Black Death in Eurasia?
   - Answer: Between 75 to 200 million people.

2. Which bacterium is believed to have caused the Black Death?
   - Answer: Yersinia pestis.

3. What is the most common form of the plague caused by Yersinia pestis?
   - Answer: Bubonic.

4. Where is the origin of the Black Death believed to be?
   - Answer: Central or East Asia.

5. How did the Black Death spread to Europe?
   - Answer: Through rats and fleas on Genoese merchant ships via the Silk Road.

6. What percentage of Europe's population is estimated to have died due to the Black Death?
   - Answer: Between 30% to 60%.

7. How long did it take for Europe's population to recover after the Black Death?
   - Answer: Approximately 200 years.

8. In which years did the Black Death reach its peak in Europe?
   - Answer: Between 1347 and 1351.

9. What was the impact of the Black Death on the world population in the 14th century?
   - Answer: The population decreased from 475 million to 350-375 million.

10. Where was the Black Death located according to the facts?
    - Answer: Eurasia and North Africa.

That's 10 questions, each based on the context and facts. I need to make sure that all answers are correctly sourced from the provided content. The 10th question is based on the fact, while the others are from the context. This should meet the user's requirements.
