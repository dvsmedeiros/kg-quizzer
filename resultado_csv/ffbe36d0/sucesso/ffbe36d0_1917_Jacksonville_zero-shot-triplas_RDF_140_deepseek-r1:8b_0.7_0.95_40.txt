Okay, so I need to create 10 question-answer pairs based on the given instructions and rules. Let me go through the data provided step by step.

First, looking at the data, it's about Jacksonville, Florida. There are various properties listed such as population, precipitation, temperature records, nicknames, and some specific locations or entities related to the city.

I should extract relevant information from each triple in the data. Each line starting with "ns1:" seems to be a property of Jacksonville, like population density, population metro, etc. The lines under "a" are defining the node, which is Jacksonville itself.

Let me list out all the properties I can gather:

- Established Title: Founded
- February low temperature: 46.1
- June precipitation inches: 7.6
- May average record low: 50.7
- Population density in km²: 490.63
- Population metro area: 1,733,937
- Population rank: 12
- Nicknames: "Jax", "The River City", "The Bold New City of the South"
- Depictions include three images
- It's a city in Florida
- It's the 12th most populous city in the US

Additionally, there are specific entities mentioned, like the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit being located there.

Now, I need to formulate questions that can be answered with this data. The goal is to create 10 pairs where each question is something someone might ask based on the information given, and the answer is directly extracted from it.

Let me think about possible questions:

1. What is one of the nicknames for Jacksonville?
2. What is the population rank of Jacksonville among US cities?
3. What is the average record low temperature in May for Jacksonville?
4. What is the population density of Jacksonville?
5. How much precipitation does Jacksonville receive in June?
6. What is the metropolitan population of Jacksonville?
7. Where is the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit located?
8. What are some depictions commonly associated with Jacksonville?
9. What is the February low temperature in Jacksonville?
10. What is another nickname for Jacksonville besides "The River City"?

Now, I'll make sure each question is clear and directly relates to an answer from the data.

Let me double-check if all information points are covered:

- Nicknames: The Bold New City of the South
- Population rank: 12
- Temperature: 50.7 in May
- Density: 490.63 km²
- Precipitation: 7.6 inches in June
- Metro population: ~1.73 million
- Court location: Jacksonville, FL
- Depictions: Three images
- February temp: 46.1 F
- Alternative nickname: Jax or The River City

Yes, all points seem covered. Now, I'll write the final pairs.
