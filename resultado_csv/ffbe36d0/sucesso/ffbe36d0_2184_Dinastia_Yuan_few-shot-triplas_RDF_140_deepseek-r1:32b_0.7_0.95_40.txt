Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs based on the provided context and facts about the Yuan dynasty. Let me start by carefully reviewing the information given.

First, from the context, I know that the Yuan dynasty was established by Kublai Khan in 1271. It's a Mongol dynasty, so questions about its origin could be relevant. Also, it mentions that it succeeded several other dynasties and kingdoms like the Song and Jin, which can lead to questions about preceding entities.

Looking at the facts section, there are numerous RDF triples that mention various aspects of the Yuan dynasty. For example, there's information about battles the Yuan were involved in, such as the Battle of Bạch Đằng (1288) and the Battle of Lake Poyang. These can be turned into questions about military conflicts.

Additionally, there are mentions of important figures like Kublai Khan, who was a key leader, so questions about leadership make sense. The dynasty's capital is mentioned as Khanbaliq and Shangdu, which could form another question.

Religions practiced during the Yuan dynasty include Buddhism, Tengrism, Shamanism, Taoism, Confucianism, Christianity, Judaism, and Islam. This diversity can be a good basis for a question about religious tolerance or practices.

The Yuan dynasty ended in 1368, leading to the Ming dynasty. So, questions about its duration and successor would fit well.

I should also consider the geographical aspects, like the capital's location, which is Beijing today. The lakes Houhai and Qianhai were built during this period, so that's another point for a question.

The Yuan dynasty had various leaders beyond Kublai Khan; Toghon Temür was mentioned as a leader, so questions about notable emperors can be included.

I need to ensure each question is clear and directly tied to the information provided. I'll avoid making them too complex or leading. Also, since the examples provided have some formatting issues (like extra commas), I should make sure my answers are clean and correct.

Let me structure these thoughts into questions:

1. Origin: Who established the Yuan dynasty?
2. Year of establishment: When was it formally declared?
3. Predecessors: What were the main predecessors?
4. Capital cities: Where were they located?
5. Notable battles: Which significant wars did they engage in?
6. Religious practices: What religions were present?
7. Duration and end: How long did it last, and what followed?
8. Key emperors: Who were important rulers besides Kublai Khan?
9. Architectural contributions: What structures were built during this time?
10. Cultural aspects: How was the dynasty depicted in art or literature?

Now, I'll draft each question with a clear answer based on the facts.
