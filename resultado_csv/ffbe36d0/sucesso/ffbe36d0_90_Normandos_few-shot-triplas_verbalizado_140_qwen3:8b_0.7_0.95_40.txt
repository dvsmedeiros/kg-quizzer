Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs based on the provided context and facts about the Normans. Let me start by understanding the content.

First, the context mentions that the Normans were a Germanic people from northern France, descendants of Vikings. They played significant roles in medieval European history, like the Norman Conquest of England, Sicily, and the Crusades. They speak Old Norse and Latin, and their culture influenced architecture, like the Normans style in churches.

Looking at the facts, there are various entries about their language (Old Norse, Latin), religious practices (Norse paganism, Christianity), architectural styles (Normans in churches like St Bride's), battles (Siege of Mahdia, Battle of Montepeloso), and connections to other groups (Norse people, Gallo-Romans, Franks). There are also mentions of specific castles and locations occupied by Normans, like Dún Dealgan Motte, Kells Castle, and Trim Castle. Additionally, some historical figures like Richard of Salerno and Alexander of Paris are associated with Normans.

Now, the user wants 10 distinct questions covering different aspects. I need to avoid repetition and ensure each question is unique. Let me brainstorm possible questions:

1. What is the origin of the word "Norman"? (From the context, it's related to Northmen or Norsemen.)
2. Which languages did the Normans speak? (Old Norse and Latin)
3. What was the primary religion of the Normans? (Norse paganism and later Christianity)
4. Which battle was part of the Norman military campaigns? (Siege of Mahdia, Battle of Montepeloso)
5. What architectural style is associated with Norman architecture? (Normans style in churches)
6. Which historical figure is associated with the Normans? (Richard of Salerno, Alexander of Paris)
7. Which countries are related to the Normans? (Jersey people, Norse people)
8. What is the significance of the Bayeux Tapestry in relation to Normans? (Imagery and events)
9. Which castles were occupied by Normans? (Dún Dealgan Motte, Kells Castle)
10. How did the Normans influence medieval European history? (Colonization, Crusades, etc.)

Wait, some of these might need to be more specific based on the facts. Let me check the facts again. For example, the Normans are related to Jersey people, Norse people, Gallo-Romans, and Franks. Also, they have specific battles and castles mentioned. Let me structure the questions to cover these points.

Another point is their language: Old Norse and Latin. Their religious practices: Norse paganism and Christianity. The Bayeux Tapestry is mentioned as an image. Also, the Normans are connected to specific castles like Trim Castle and Waytemore Castle.

I need to ensure each question is unique and based on the facts provided. Let me list 10 questions and their answers, making sure they are accurate and derived from the context and facts.

For example:
- "Quais idiomas os normandos falavam?" → "Idioma antigo nórdico e latim."
- "Quais são os grupos históricos relacionados aos normandos?" → "Vikings, Galo-Romanos, Francos."
- "Qual é o significado original da palavra 'Norman'?" → "Homens do Norte."
- "Quais castelos foram ocupados pelos normandos?" → "Dún Dealgan Motte, Kells Castle, Trim Castle."
- "Quais são as religiões seguidas pelos normandos?" → "Paganismo nórdico e cristianismo."
- "Quais batalhas envolveram normandos?" → "Siege of Mahdia, Battle of Montepeloso."
- "Qual é o estilo arquitetônico associado aos normandos?" → "Estilo normando."
- "Quais figuras históricas têm origem nos normandos?" → "Richard of Salerno, Alexander of Paris."
- "Quais idiomas são falados pelos normandos?" → "Latim e antigo nórdico."
- "Quais são as imagens representativas dos normandos?" → "Lusignan.jpg, Norman Conquests copy.jpg, Bayeux Tapestry scene19 detail."

I need to make sure the answers are concise and directly from the facts. Also, check for any repetition. Let me compile these into the required JSON format.
