Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to generate 10 pairs of questions and answers based on the given context and facts. The output needs to be in JSON format, each with "pergunta" and "resposta". 

First, I need to understand the context provided. The context talks about construction in engineering and architecture, mentioning terms like "construção" and "obra", and how in Brazil, "reforma" is used for renovations, expansions, etc. The facts list various companies and terms related to the construction industry.

Now, the rules say the questions must be varied, cover different aspects, and have a single correct answer from the content. No repetition of similar questions. Also, no extra explanations, just the JSON.

Looking at the examples, some questions are about definitions, others about specific terms, companies, or processes. I need to ensure that each question is unique and based on the provided data.

Let me start by listing possible angles. The context mentions the definition of construction, the term "reforma" in Brazil, the industries companies belong to, hypernyms, and some specific examples like "Template:JAP" or "List of countries with the largest construction GVA in 2018". 

For questions, I can ask about the definition of construction, the Brazilian term for renovations, examples of companies in the construction industry, hypernyms related to construction, specific models or templates used, and so on.

I need to make sure each question is distinct. Let me check the facts again. There are multiple entries about companies in the construction industry, some have "hiperônimo" (hypernym) like "Construction", others have products or services in construction. Also, some entries mention specific models like "Template:JAP" or "Template:Other uses".

Possible questions:

1. What is the definition of construction according to the context?
   - Answer: The execution of the project from foundation to finish, respecting techniques and standards.

2. What term is used in Brazil for renovations, expansions, etc.?
   - Answer: Reforma.

3. Which company is mentioned as belonging to the Construction industry?
   - Answer: Aecon (or any other company name from the facts).

But I need to ensure that the answers are explicitly in the context or facts. For example, the context says "No Brasil, o termo reforma é o mais utilizado..." so that's a direct answer.

Another angle: hypernyms. For example, "Generalizations of the derivative" has a hypernym "Construction". So a question could be: What is the hypernym of "Generalizations of the derivative"?
   - Answer: Construction.

Similarly, "Tropico 4" has hypernym "Construction".

Also, some entries mention specific models like "Template:JAP" or "Template:RUS" used by Construction. So a question could be: Which template is used by Construction in Wikipedia?
   - Answer: Template:JAP (or others like Template:RUS, etc.).

Another fact is "Construction possui dado máximo 1500" which might refer to a maximum value, but without more context, it's hard to say. Maybe a question about that? But the answer would be "1500".

Also, "Construction News pertence à categoria Construction" so a question could be: Which publication belongs to the Construction category?
   - Answer: Construction News.

I need to make 10 of these. Let me list them:

1. Define construction according to the context.
2. What term is used in Brazil for renovations?
3. Which company is part of the Construction industry?
4. What is the hypernym of "Generalizations of the derivative"?
5. Which template is used by Construction in Wikipedia?
6. What is the maximum value associated with Construction?
7. Which company has "hiperônimo Construction"?
8. What is the category of "Construction News"?
9. What is the term for the execution of a project in construction?
10. Which company is mentioned as having services in Construction?

Wait, need to check if the answers are present in the facts. For example, "Aecon pertence à indústria Construction" so "Aecon" is a valid answer. Similarly, "Generalizations of the derivative" has hiperônimo "Construction". The template "Template:JAP" is used by Construction. The maximum value is 1500. "Construction News" is in the category Construction. 

I need to ensure that each question's answer is directly from the facts or context. Also, avoid repetition. Let me structure each pair now.
