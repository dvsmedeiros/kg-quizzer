Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to generate 10 question-answer pairs based on the provided context about Sky_UK. First, I need to make sure I understand the requirements. They specified that each pair should have a relevant question and a correct answer, in Portuguese, with no extra content.

Wait, the context given is just "Sky_UK" followed by a separator and then "## Instrução Final". That's a bit confusing. Maybe there was a mistake in the input, and the actual context wasn't provided. But the user mentioned the context is "Sky_UK", so perhaps that's all there is. However, generating questions without specific content might be challenging. Maybe the user intended to include more information but forgot. 

But since the user is asking for questions based on the given context, I have to work with what's provided. The key here is to create questions that are relevant to Sky_UK, even if the details are minimal. For example, Sky_UK is a British satellite television company. So possible questions could be about its services, history, offerings, etc.

I need to ensure that each question is unique and covers different aspects. Let's brainstorm some topics: services offered, launch year, major channels, customer base, technology used, partnerships, awards, market position, online services, and future plans. Each of these can form a question. 

Now, the answers need to be correct based on the context. Since the context is limited, I'll have to use general knowledge about Sky_UK. For instance, Sky_UK was launched in 1992, offers broadband, TV, and phone services, has major channels like Sky Sports and Sky News, etc. 

I need to make sure not to repeat similar questions. Let me check each pair to ensure variety. Also, the language must be Portuguese. Let me translate the questions and answers accordingly. 

Wait, the user provided the context as "Sky_UK" but didn't give more details. So I should base the answers on common knowledge about Sky_UK. For example, if a question is about the launch year, the answer would be 1992. If it's about major channels, list those. 

I need to generate exactly 10 pairs. Let me list them out, ensuring each is distinct and covers different aspects. Also, verify that each answer is directly inferable from the context or general knowledge. 

Once the pairs are created, I'll format them into a JSON array as specified, without any extra text. Let me double-check the rules: no repetitions, correct answers, Portuguese language, and only the required structure.
