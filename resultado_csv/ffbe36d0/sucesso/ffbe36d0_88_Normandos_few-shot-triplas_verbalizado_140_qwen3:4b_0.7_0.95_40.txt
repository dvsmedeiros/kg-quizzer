Okay, the user wants me to generate 10 objective questions and answers based on the provided context and facts about the Normans. Let me start by understanding the context and the facts given.

The context mentions that the Normans were a Germanic people in northern France, descended from Vikings, and their influence in medieval Europe. The facts include various points like their relation to languages, historical events, castles, religious practices, and more. 

I need to make sure the questions cover different aspects: history, language, religion, cultural influences, geographical locations, and key events. Also, each question must have a unique answer derived from the facts. Let me list out possible topics:

1. Origin of the term "Normans" (Northmen)
2. Language spoken by Normans (Old Norse, Latin)
3. Religious beliefs (Norse paganism, Christianity)
4. Key historical events (Battle of Hastings, Siege of Mahdia)
5. Locations associated with Normans (Normandy, castles like Kells Castle)
6. Ethnic groups related to Normans (Jersey people, Hauteville family)
7. Influence on architecture (St Bride's Church style)
8. Historical events involving Normans (Battle of Civitate)
9. Cultural artifacts (Bayeux Tapestry)
10. Nationalities of notable people (Richard of Salerno)

Now, I need to ensure each question is distinct and based on the facts. Let me check the facts again to confirm. For example, the Normans are related to Old Norse and Latin, they followed Norse paganism and Christianity, they were involved in the Battle of Hastings, and they built castles like Kells Castle. Also, the Bayeux Tapestry is mentioned as an image related to them.

I should avoid repeating similar questions. For instance, the origin of the term is covered, so I can ask about the meaning of "Normans" and the languages they spoke. Also, the religious aspects are covered in two points. Need to make sure each question is unique.

Let me structure the questions and answers step by step, ensuring that each answer is directly from the facts provided. Also, check that the answers are in Portuguese as per the instructions. Let me verify each fact again to make sure the answers are correct.
