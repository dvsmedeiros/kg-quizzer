Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs based on the provided data about Warsaw. Let me start by looking through the information given. 

First, there's a lot of entities related to Warsaw, such as people, organizations, locations, and some weather data. The user wants questions that can be answered using this data. I should make sure each question is clear and directly related to the information provided. 

Looking at the data, there are entries for people like Michał Kalecki, who died in Warsaw. There are also organizations like the Ministry of Finance in Poland, which has its headquarters in Warsaw. Places like the Warsaw Ghetto and the University of Warsaw are mentioned. 

I should also consider the weather data, like the average temperature in April and the UTC offset. The user might be interested in factual questions about Warsaw's weather, history, or notable places. 

I need to ensure that each answer is accurate based on the given data. For example, the University of Warsaw is located in Warsaw. The Warsaw Ghetto is in Warsaw. The UTC offset is +2. 

I should avoid repeating the same type of question. Maybe include a mix of people, places, organizations, and weather. Let me check if I have 10 distinct questions. 

Wait, the user said "gere agora os 10 pares" so I need to make sure each pair is unique and answers are derived from the data provided. Let me list them out:

1. Who is the person associated with the death place in Warsaw? (Michał Kalecki)
2. Which organization's headquarters is in Warsaw? (Ministry of Finance)
3. What is the UTC offset for Warsaw? (+2)
4. What is the location of the Warsaw Ghetto? (Warsaw)
5. Which university is located in Warsaw? (University of Warsaw)
6. What is the average temperature in April for Warsaw? (-1.6°C)

9. Which radio station is based in Warsaw? (Radio Eska)
10. What is the location of the Warsaw Airlift? (Warsaw)

I need to check if all these are correct based on the data. The answer for the bridge is "Śląsko-Dąbrowski Bridge" as per the data. The radio station is Radio Eska, which is in Warsaw. The Warsaw Airlift is in Warsaw. Yes, these all seem to be correct. I should format each as a question and answer pair in Portuguese, making sure the answers are accurate.
