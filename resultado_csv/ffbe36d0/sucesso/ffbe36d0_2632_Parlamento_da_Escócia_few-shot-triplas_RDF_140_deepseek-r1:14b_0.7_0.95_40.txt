Okay, I need to create 10 question and answer pairs based on the given information about the Scottish Parliament. Let me start by reviewing the provided data to understand key points.

First, looking at the RDF data, the Scottish Parliament is a unicameral legislature established in 1998 with its headquarters in Edinburgh. The current Presiding Officer is Alison Johnstone. Committees include Economy, Energy and Tourism; Education, Lifelong Learning and Culture; Equal Opportunities; Europe and External Relations; Finance; Local Government and Communities; Rural Affairs and Environment; Scottish Parliamentary Pensions Scheme; and Climate Change.

The parliament follows the Additional member system for elections, with recent elections in 2021. The legislative period is named "6th Scottish Parliament."

In the examples provided, each question is factual and relates to key aspects of the parliament's history, structure, or powers. I should follow this style, ensuring questions cover various angles like establishment, functions, committees, leadership, historical context, and elections.

Let me brainstorm possible questions based on the data:

1. Year of establishment: "When was the current Scottish Parliament established?" Answer: 1998.
2. Headquarters location: "Where is the Scottish Parliament located?" Answer: Edinburgh.
3. Key figure: "Who is the Presiding Officer?" Answer: Alison Johnstone.
4. Committees: "What are some key committees?" Answers include Economy, Energy and Tourism; Education, etc.
5. Voting system: "Which voting system does it use?" Answer: Additional member system.
6. Recent elections: "When were the last elections held?" Answer: 2021.
7. Powers reserved: "To which body are certain powers reserved?" Answer: UK Parliament (Westminster).
8. Historical aspect: "What was recommended by the Kllbrandon Report of 1973?" Answer: Establish a directly elected Scottish Assembly.
9. Timeline: "How many centuries was Scotland governed directly by Westminster?" Answer: Three hundred years.
10. Nationalism rise: "When did Scottish nationalism surge?" From examples, it's unclear but could be linked to the late 20th century.

Wait, looking back at the userâ€™s example, some answers are incomplete or have placeholders. I should ensure my questions are clear and answers are complete based on the data provided.

I think the key points to cover are: establishment year (1998), location (Edinburgh), Presiding Officer (Alison Johnstone), committees (list a few), voting system, recent elections (2021), reserved powers (UK Parliament), Kllbrandon Report recommendation, historical governance duration, and surge in nationalism.

Now I'll structure each question to target these areas clearly.
