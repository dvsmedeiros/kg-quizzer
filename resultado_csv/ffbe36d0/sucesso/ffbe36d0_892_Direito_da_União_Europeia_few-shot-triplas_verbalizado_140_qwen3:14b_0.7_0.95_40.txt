Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs based on the provided context and facts. Let me start by carefully reading through the user's instructions again to make sure I understand all the requirements.

First, the objective is to create exactly 10 pairs, each with a question and a correct answer in Portuguese. The output must be a JSON array with the specified structure. No extra text or explanations are allowed—just the JSON.

Looking at the context, it talks about the European Union's laws being a system of rules operating in member states, starting from the European Coal and Steel Community post-WWII. The EU's goal is peace, values, and well-being. It mentions institutions that transcend nation-states for cooperation and human development. The EU's Court of Justice says it's a new international legal order.

The facts section lists various entities and models related to the Law of the European Union, like the Common Market Law Review, John Bell, Henry G. Schermers, and Wikipedia templates. However, the user's examples focus more on the structure of EU law (primary, secondary, complementary sources) and institutions like the European Parliament and Council. But the provided context doesn't mention these details. Wait, the examples might be from previous data, but the current context and facts are different.

Wait, the user's examples include questions about primary and secondary sources of EU law, which aren't explicitly mentioned in the current context. The current context only mentions the EU's laws as a system of rules, their historical origin, and the Court of Justice's statement. The facts mention things like the Common Market Law Review, John Bell, Henry Schermers, and Wikipedia templates. So I need to base the questions strictly on the provided context and facts, not the examples, even though the examples are from the same topic.

So, the context says the EU's laws are a system of rules in member states, established after WWII with the European Coal and Steel Community. The purpose is promoting peace, values, and well-being. The EU has political, social, and economic institutions that transcend nation-states. The Court of Justice says it's a new international legal order.

The facts mention Law of the European Union as a main topic, Common Market Law Review in that discipline, John Bell and Henry Schermers in that area, and some Wikipedia templates used.

So, possible questions could be:

1. What is the main objective of the European Union's laws? (Based on the context: promoting peace, values, and well-being)
2. Which institution is responsible for defining the EU as a new international legal order? (The Court of Justice)
3. What was the first institution established by the EU after WWII? (European Coal and Steel Community)
4. What is the role of the EU's institutions? (Transcend nation-states for cooperation and human development)
5. What is the main source of EU law according to the context? (The treaties establishing the EU)
6. What does the EU's Court of Justice say about the EU's legal order? (A new international legal order)
7. What is the primary aim of the EU according to its founding principles? (Promote peace, values, and well-being)
8. Which historical event led to the creation of the European Coal and Steel Community? (Post-WWII)
9. What are the three types of EU institutions mentioned in the context? (Political, social, economic)
10. How does the EU's legal system operate in member states? (Through a system of rules that transcend nation-states)

Wait, but the facts also mention entities like the Common Market Law Review, John Bell, Henry Schermers, and the Wikipedia templates. However, the user's examples didn't use these, so maybe the questions should be based on the context and facts provided, even if they are more about the structure of the law (but the context doesn't mention primary/secondary sources). So perhaps the facts are more about academic disciplines and resources, not the content of EU law itself.

So, possible questions based on the facts:

1. Which academic journal is associated with the Law of the European Union? (Common Market Law Review)
2. Who is a legal scholar associated with the Law of the European Union? (John Bell)
3. What is the subdiscipline of Henry G. Schermers? (Law of the European Union)
4. What Wikipedia template is used in the Law of the European Union? (Template:R from word rearrangement, etc.)

But the user's examples were more about the structure and institutions of EU law, which might not be covered in the current context. However, the user's instructions say to base the questions on the provided context and facts, not the examples.

So, combining both context and facts, the 10 pairs could be:

1. What was the first institution established by the European Union after World War II?
   - European Coal and Steel Community

2. What is the main objective of the European Union's laws?
   - Promote peace, its values, and the well-being of its peoples

3. Which institution of the European Union is responsible for stating that the EU represents a new international legal order?
   - The Court of Justice

4. What role do the EU's institutions play according to the context?
   - They transcend the nation-state for cooperation and human development

5. What is the primary source of EU law as mentioned in the context?
   - Treaties that establish the European Union

6. Which academic journal is associated with the Law of the European Union?
   - Common Market Law Review

7. Who is a legal scholar associated with the Law of the European Union?
   - John Bell

8. What is the subdiscipline of Henry G. Schermers?
   - Law of the European Union

9. What Wikipedia template is used in the Law of the European Union?
   - Template:R from word rearrangement

10. What is the effect of EU law on the laws of member states according to the context?
    - Effect direct or indirect (But the context doesn't mention effect direct or indirect, so this might not be valid. Wait, the context says the EU's laws are a system of rules that operate in member states, but it doesn't mention direct or indirect effect. So maybe that's not from the current context.)

Hmm, the example from the user had a question about the effect being direct or indirect, but that's not in the current context. So I need to avoid that.

So, maybe the 10th question could be about the EU's institutions transcending nation-states, but that was already covered in question 4.

Alternatively, what are the key elements of the EU's legal system according to the Court of Justice?
- A new international legal order

So, adjusting the questions:

1. What was the first institution established by the European Union after World War II?
   - European Coal and Steel Community

2. What is the main objective of the European Union's laws?
   - Promote peace, its values, and the well-being of its peoples

3. Which institution of the European Union is responsible for stating that the EU represents a new international legal order?
   - The Court of Justice

4. What role do the EU's institutions play according to the context?
   - They transcend the nation-state for cooperation and human development

5. What is the primary source of EU law as mentioned in the context?
   - Treaties that establish the European Union

6. Which academic journal is associated with the Law of the European Union?
   - Common Market Law Review

7. Who is a legal scholar associated with the Law of the European Union?
   - John Bell

8. What is the subdiscipline of Henry G. Schermers?
   - Law of the European Union

9. What Wikipedia template is used in the Law of the European Union?
   - Template:R from word rearrangement

10. What does the EU's Court of Justice say about the EU's legal order?
    - A new international legal order

That makes 10 pairs. Let me check if these are all based on the context and facts provided. Yes, each question and answer is derived from the context or the facts. The examples from the user had different focus, but the current instruction is to use the provided context and facts. So this should be correct.
