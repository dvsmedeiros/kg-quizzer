Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to generate 10 pairs of questions and answers based on the provided context and facts. The key points are that the questions must be varied, cover different aspects, and the answers must be directly from the content. I need to make sure not to repeat similar questions and that each answer is either explicit or inferable from the given data.

First, I'll look through the context. It mentions economic inequality, its aspects like income, wealth, consumption, measures like Gini coefficient, HDI, concepts like equity, equality of results, opportunities, and some facts about global inequality trends. The facts include various models, images, categories, and related topics.

Now, I need to create questions that touch on different parts of this. Let's start with the measures of economic inequality. The context says the Gini coefficient is the most used, so a question about that makes sense. Then, the HDI adjusted for inequality is another measure. Next, the factors affecting growth—there's a mention that higher inequality hinders duration but not the rate. 

Then, the global vs. within-country inequality: the context states that globalization reduced global inequality but increased within-country. That's a good question. 

Concepts like equity, equality of results, and opportunities are mentioned. So a question on those would be good. 

The context also lists some specific books and authors, like Branko Milanović and "Capital in the Twenty-First Century." So a question about who works on economic inequality. 

Images and data representations: the context has several images, like the GINI index graph and wealth distribution. A question about the image with the GINI index. 

Another aspect is the types of economic inequality, like wealth, income, consumption. A question on the main types. 

The impact of globalization on inequality between and within countries. 

Lastly, the factors that influence the duration of economic growth, as per the context. 

Wait, I need to check if each answer is explicitly in the context or can be inferred. For example, the Gini coefficient is directly mentioned. The HDI adjusted is also there. The effect on growth duration is stated. Globalization's effect is clear. The concepts are listed. The authors and books are in the facts. The GINI image is mentioned. The types of inequality are in the context. The globalization impact is there. The factors affecting growth duration are mentioned. 

I need to ensure that each question is unique and covers different aspects. Let me count: 1. Measures (Gini), 2. HDI adjusted, 3. Growth duration, 4. Globalization's effect, 5. Concepts (equity, etc.), 6. Authors (Branko Milanović), 7. Image (GINI index), 8. Types (wealth, income, consumption), 9. Globalization's effect on inequality, 10. Factors on growth duration. That's 10. 

Wait, but some might overlap. Let me check again. The 4th and 9th might be similar. The 4th is about globalization reducing global inequality but increasing within countries. The 9th is about factors influencing growth duration. Wait, no, the 9th is about the impact of globalization on inequality, which is covered in the context. The 4th is about the effect of globalization on inequality between and within countries. So they are different. 

I think that's covered. Now, I'll structure each question and answer based on the context and facts provided, making sure the answers are directly from the content.
