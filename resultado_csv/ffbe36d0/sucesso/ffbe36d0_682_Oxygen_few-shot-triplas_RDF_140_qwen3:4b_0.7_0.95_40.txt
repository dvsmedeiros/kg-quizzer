Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to generate 10 objective questions and answers based on the provided context and facts about oxygen. First, I need to make sure I understand the context thoroughly. The text gives a lot of information about oxygen's atomic number, its group in the periodic table, its role in the atmosphere, its reactivity, its discovery, and its applications.

I need to create questions that cover different aspects without repeating. Let's start by listing the key points from the context:

1. Atomic number 8, symbol O.
2. Group of chalcogens.
3. Reactivity and oxidizing properties.
4. Abundance in the universe and Earth's crust.
5. Composition of the atmosphere (20.8% O2).
6. Discovery by Priestley and Lavoisier.
7. Uses in medical, industrial, and aerospace fields.
8. Toxicity at high concentrations.
9. Role in photosynthesis.
10. Different forms (gas, liquid, solid).

Now, I need to form questions around these points. Let me check the examples provided. The examples include questions about atomic number, group, abundance, atmospheric composition, etc. I should avoid repeating the same questions but cover similar topics.

Wait, the user mentioned the example where the answer was "O gás diatômico" for the question about what gas makes up 20.8% of the atmosphere. But the correct answer should be "O2" or "oxygen gas". However, the example says "O gás diatômico", which is a bit vague. Maybe the user intended to say "oxygen gas" but the example answer is a bit confusing. However, the user's instruction says to follow the examples, so maybe I need to stick to that.

But in the actual context, it says "o gás diatômico" (diatomic gas) is O2. So the answer should be "o gás diatômico" (diatomic gas). But in the example, the answer is "O gás diatômico", which is correct. So I need to make sure that the answer is accurate.

Another point: the example had a question about the second most abundant element in the universe, which is helium. But in the context, it says "o segundo elemento mais abundante" is helium. Wait, the context says: "o segundo elemento mais abundante" is helium? Let me check the original text again.

Looking back: "O número atômico da tabela periódica de oxigênio?" is 8. Then, "Qual é o segundo elemento mais abundante?" answer is "hélio." Wait, the context says "o segundo elemento mais abundante" is helium. But in the universe, the most abundant elements are hydrogen and helium. So the example is correct. But the text says "o segundo elemento mais abundante" is helium. That seems correct.

So, I need to make sure that the questions and answers are based on the provided text. Let me go through the text again to find more points.

The text mentions that oxygen is a reactive nonmetal, forms oxides, is a diatomic gas, is the third most abundant element in the universe, and is involved in photosynthesis. Also, the discovery by Priestley and Lavoisier, and its uses in medical, industrial, and aerospace fields.

So, possible questions:

1. Atomic number of oxygen.
2. Group in the periodic table.
3. Abundance in the universe.
4. Abundance in Earth's crust.
5. Composition of the atmosphere.
6. Role in photosynthesis.
7. Discovery by whom.
8. Uses in medical and industry.
9. Toxicity at high concentration.
10. Different states (gas, liquid, solid).

But need to check if these are covered in the text. Let me check:

- The text says "o segundo elemento mais abundante" is helium. Wait, no. The text says "o segundo elemento mais abundante" is helium? Wait, the original text says: "Aproximadamente, quanto oxigênio compõe a crosta terrestre?" answer is "quase metade." Then, "Qual é o segundo elemento mais abundante?" answer is "hélio." But in the universe, oxygen is the third most abundant, but the text says "o segundo" is helium. Wait, the text says: "O número atômico da tabela periódica de oxigênio?" answer is 8. Then, "Qual é o segundo elemento mais abundante?" answer is "hélio." But that's incorrect. Wait, in the universe, the most abundant elements are hydrogen (about 75%), helium (about 25%), then oxygen is third. So the example is wrong. However, the user provided that example, so maybe the text in the context says that the second most abundant is helium. Wait, the original text says:

"In the universe, the most abundant elements are hydrogen, helium, and oxygen. However, the text says: "O número atômico da tabela periódica de oxigênio?" is 8. Then, "Qual é o segundo elemento mais abundante?" answer is "hélio." But according to the text, the second is helium, and the third is oxygen. Wait, but that's conflicting with the actual facts. However, the user's example says that, so maybe in the context given, the answer is helium. So I need to follow the text provided, not real-world knowledge.

But the user's instruction says to generate based on the provided context, so I need to use the information given in the text. Let me check the text again.

In the original context, the user provided a text that says:

"O número atômico da tabela periódica de oxigênio?"

The answer is "8."

Then, the example says "Qual é o segundo elemento mais abundante?" answer is "hélio." So according to the text, the second most abundant is helium. But in reality, oxygen is third. However, the text in the example says that. So I have to follow the text given, not real-world facts.

Therefore, the answer to "Qual é o segundo elemento mais abundante?" is "hélio."

So, I need to create 10 questions based on that. Let me start.

1. What is the atomic number of oxygen?
   Answer: 8.

2. Which group is oxygen a member of?
   Answer: chalcogen.

3. What is the most abundant element in the universe?
   Answer: hydrogen. Wait, but the text says "o segundo elemento mais abundante" is helium, so the first is hydrogen, second is helium, third is oxygen. So the answer to "Qual é o elemento mais abundante?" would be hydrogen, but the example says "Qual é o segundo elemento mais abundante?" is helium. So the user's example says that.

But in the text, the user provided that. So maybe the text says that oxygen is the third. So the answer to "Qual é o segundo elemento mais abundante?" is helium.

So, I need to make sure that the questions and answers are based on the text provided.

Another point: the text says that oxygen is a reactive nonmetal, so a question could be about its classification.

Also, the text mentions that two atoms form O2, so a question about that.

The text says that oxygen is involved in photosynthesis, so a question about that.

The text also mentions that oxygen is used in medical, industrial, and aerospace fields.

Also, the text says that at high concentrations, it's toxic.

So, compiling all these points, here are the 10 questions:

1. What is the atomic number of oxygen?
   Answer: 8.

2. Which group is oxygen a member of?
   Answer: chalcogen.

3. What is the most abundant element in the universe?
   Answer: hydrogen.

4. What is the second most abundant element in the universe?
   Answer: helium.

5. What is the percentage of oxygen in the Earth's atmosphere?
   Answer: 20.8%.

6. How many atoms combine to form diatomic oxygen?
   Answer: two atoms.

7. What is the role of oxygen in photosynthesis?
   Answer: it is a key component in the process.

8. What is the name of the diatomic gas formed by two oxygen atoms?
   Answer: O2.

9. Which scientists discovered oxygen?
   Answer: Priestley and Lavoisity.

10. What is the toxicity of oxygen at high concentrations?
   Answer: it can be toxic.

Wait, but the example had a question about toxicity. Let me check the text. The text says "sob condições normais, o que dois átomos de oxigênio formam?" answer is "o gás diatômico" (diatomic gas). But the example answer was "O gás diatômico", which is correct.

But in the example, there was a question about "o que dois átomos de oxigênio formam?" and the answer was "o gás diatômico". So the answer is "o gás diatômico".

But in the text, it says "o gás diatômico" (diatomic gas) is O2.

So, the answer to "sob condições normais, o que dois átomos de oxigênio formam?" is "o gás diatômico".

But the example had a different answer. Wait, the example says:

{
  "pergunta": "Qual gás compõe 20,8% da atmosfera da Terra?",
  "resposta": "O gás diatômico"
}

But that's incorrect because the answer should be O2 (oxygen gas), but the example says "O gás diatômico", which is correct. However, the text says "o gás diatômico" is O2.

So, I need to make sure that the answers are accurate based on the text.

Now, I need to make sure that the 10 questions are unique and cover different aspects. Let me check if I have 10.

1. Atomic number: 8.

2. Group: chalcogen.

3. Most abundant element in universe: hydrogen.

4. Second most abundant: helium.

5. Atmosphere percentage: 20.8%.

6. Diatomic formation: two atoms form O2 (diatomic gas).

7. Role in photosynthesis: key component.

8. Discovery: Priestley and Lavoisier.

9. Toxicity: can be toxic.

10. What is the third most abundant element in the universe? (if the text says that oxygen is third, then answer is oxygen.)

Wait, in the text, the example says that the second is helium, so the third is oxygen. So the answer to "Qual é o terceiro elemento mais abundante?" is oxygen.

So that's another question.

So, the 10 questions would be:

1. Atomic number.

2. Group.

3. Most abundant in universe.

4. Second in universe.

5. Atmosphere percentage.

6. Diatomic gas.

7. Role in photosynthesis.

8. Discoverers.

9. Toxicity.

10. Third in universe.

But the text may not mention the third, but the example had the second as helium. So the third is oxygen.

But the text says that oxygen is the third most abundant in the universe. So that's a valid question.

So, the 10 questions would be:

1. What is the atomic number of oxygen?

2. Which group is oxygen a member of?

3. What is the most abundant element in the universe?

4. What is the second most abundant element in the universe?

5. What percentage of the Earth's atmosphere is composed of oxygen?

6. How many atoms combine to form diatomic oxygen?

7. What is the role of oxygen in photosynthesis?

8. Who discovered oxygen?

9. What is the effect of high concentrations of oxygen?

10. What is the third most abundant element in the universe?

But I need to check if these are all covered in the text.

The text says:

- The atomic number is 8.

- The group is chalcogen.

- The most abundant element in the universe is hydrogen.

- The second is helium.

- The atmosphere is 20.8% O2 (so the percentage is 20.8%).

- Two atoms form O2.

- Photosynthesis uses oxygen.

- Discovery by Priestley and Lavoisier.

- Toxicity at high concentrations.

- Third is oxygen.

Yes.

So, these 10 questions are covered. Now, translating these into Portuguese and making sure that the answers are correct based on the text.

So, the final answer would be 10 questions with answers as per the text.
