Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs based on the provided context and facts about British Satellite Broadcasting (BSB). Let me start by reading through the context and the facts carefully to identify key points.

First, the context mentions that BSB was incorporated in November 1990 to form BSkyB and started transmitting on March 25, 1990. Wait, that seems a bit confusing. The context says they were incorporated in November 1990 to form BSkyB, but also that they started transmitting in March 1990. That might be a typo or maybe the company was founded earlier but incorporated in November. The facts also state the founding date as 1986-12-11. So the correct founding year is 1986, but they were incorporated in 1990 to merge with Sky Television to form BSkyB.

Next, looking at the facts, there are several TV channels owned or produced by BSB, like Galaxy, Now, The Movie Channel, etc. The successor company is Sky UK. The company was located in London, UK. The classes and categories indicate it's a media company in the UK.

Possible questions could be about the founding date, the merger, the successor company, the location, the channels they owned, the date they started transmitting, etc. I need to make sure each question is unique and covers different aspects. Let me list possible topics:

1. Founding date (1986-12-11)
2. Merger with Sky Television to form BSkyB in 1990
3. Successor company (Sky UK)
4. Location (London, UK)
5. Channels owned (Galaxy, Now, The Movie Channel, etc.)
6. Transmission start date (March 25, 1990 vs. incorporation in November 1990 – need to clarify which is correct)
7. Categories they belong to (e.g., media companies of the UK)
8. Founding year (1986)
9. Fate of the company (merged)
10. Other related channels or productions (like Hardware film, Heil Honey I'm Home!)

Wait, the context says BSB was incorporated in November 1990 to form BSkyB, but the facts mention the founding date as 1986. So the company was founded in 1986, but the merger happened in 1990. The transmission start date is March 25, 1990, which is before the merger. So the correct sequence is: founded in 1986, started transmitting in 1990, then merged in 1990 to form BSkyB.

So questions could be:

- What year was BSB founded? (1986)
- When did BSB start transmitting? (March 25, 1990)
- What company did BSB merge with in 1990? (Sky Television)
- What was the name of the merged company? (BSkyB)
- What is the successor company of BSB? (Sky UK)
- In which city was BSB located? (London)
- What type of company was BSB? (Media company of the UK)
- Which TV channels did BSB own? (Galaxy, Now, etc.)
- What was the fate of BSB? (Merged with Sky Television to form BSkyB)
- What category does BSB belong to? (Defunct mass media companies of the UK)

I need to make sure each question is distinct and the answers are directly from the context or facts. Let me check each point again to avoid repetition and ensure accuracy.
