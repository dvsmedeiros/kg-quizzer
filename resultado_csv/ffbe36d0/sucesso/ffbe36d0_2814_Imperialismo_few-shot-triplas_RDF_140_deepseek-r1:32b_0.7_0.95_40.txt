Okay, so I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs based on the given context and facts about imperialism. The user has provided a detailed explanation of what an empire is, including aspects like territorial expansion, governance by a sovereign or oligarchy, and examples from history. Additionally, there are RDF triples that link various entities related to imperialism.

First, I'll start by understanding the context thoroughly. An empire is a large territory with diverse peoples under a central authority, often formed through conquest. The term "imperium" comes from Latin, meaning power or authority. The Roman Empire is a prime example mentioned.

Looking at the facts provided via RDF triples, there are several points of interest:
- Imperialism is associated with certain political parties and ideologies.
- It's linked to genocides and war crimes as motives.
- Specific authors and works discuss imperialism, like "Culture and Imperialism."
- There are mentions ofTemplate usage on Wikipedia pages related to imperialism.

Now, I'll brainstorm different aspects that can be turned into questions. The questions should cover various angles: definitions, examples, associated entities (like people or events), causes, effects, and historical contexts.

1. Definition-based question about the origin of "imperium."
2. Identify an example of a well-known empire.
3. Ask about the motive behind specific genocides.
4. Name a book that discusses imperialism.
5. Inquire aboutTemplate usage in Wikipedia articles on the topic.
6. Mention someone who opposed imperialism.
7. Discuss the structure of an empire, like central vs. peripheral regions.
8. Relate imperialism to historical events like the "Scramble for Africa."
9. Identify a political party associated with imperialist ideology.
10. Ask about the main interests or focus areas related to studying imperialism.

I need to ensure each question has only one correct answer based on the provided data and that they don't repeat similar content. For example, avoiding multiple questions about the same event or person unless necessary.

Now, translating these thoughts into actual questions and answers:

1. Origin of "imperium" – Latin.
2. Example empire – Roman Empire.
3. Genocide motive – Imperialism.
4. Book title – "Culture and Imperialism."
5. Template used – Template:Empires.
6. Opponent – Léon-Étienne Duval.
7. Structure – central/metropole vs peripheries.
8. Historical event – Scramble for Africa.
9. Political party – Canadian Party.
10. Academic focus – Wolfgang Mommsen.

I'll structure each as a clear question with the exact answer from the context and facts, ensuring variety in topics covered.
