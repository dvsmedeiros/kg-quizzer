Okay, let me try to figure out how to approach this request. The user wants exactly 10 pairs of questions and answers related to computational complexity theory. Each pair should have a question and a single correct answer in Portuguese. I need to make sure that the questions are varied and cover different aspects of the topic.

First, I'll start by recalling what I know about computational complexity. It's a field in computer science that deals with how efficiently problems can be solved using algorithms. Key concepts include time complexity (how long it takes) and space complexity (how much memory it uses). There are various classes like P (problems solvable in polynomial time), NP (nondeterministic polynomial time), and others.

I should think of questions that ask about the classification of problems, such as whether a problem is P, NP, or something else. For example, one question could be about determining if a given problem is computationally feasible. The answer would need to state which class it belongs to, like NP-Complete.

Next, I can explore different areas within complexity theory. Quantum computing comes to mind since it's a hot area now. A question here might ask about the classes affected by quantum computers, such as BQP (Bounded-error probabilistic polynomial time). The answer would state that some problems become efficiently solvable in this context.

Cryptography is another important aspect. It involves understanding what makes certain problems hard to solve, which affects security. So a question like "What's the problem of factoring large numbers?" and its corresponding answer about how it's used in cryptography makes sense here.

Then, I can think about specific algorithms. For example, determining if two strings are anagrams would involve checking their frequency counts. This is a simple problem but has implications for more complex tasks like pattern matching or sorting.

The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is another classic problem that's NP-hard. It's used in various real-world applications like logistics and planning. A question about it and its complexity class would be useful, especially since TSP is a well-known example of an optimization problem.

Another area could be lower bounds. The question "Is there a language that can't be recognized efficiently?" with the answer that all languages are potentially in NP or co-NP ties into whether we know certain classes better than others.

For more specific cases, like matching jobs to students optimally, it's an assignment problem which is related to maximum weight bipartite matching. This gives a real-world application and its computational complexity.

Lastly, quantum computing problems can be tricky. The question about QMA being the quantum analog of NP would touch on how quantum algorithms compare in efficiency to classical ones.

Now, I need to make sure each pair has one question with a single answer in Portuguese. I should also structure them correctly, using HTML pairs with specific tags for questions and responses.

I have 10 topics covered, so that's the count needed. Each response should be concise but informative, explaining why it's correct. I'll ensure there are no markdown formats beyond bold headers if needed, as per the user's instructions.

Finally, I need to present all this in a JSON format as specified. Making sure each question and its corresponding answer is within their own object and that the array is properly formatted with ten pairs.
