Okay, so I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs based on the provided information about prime numbers and related data. Let me start by understanding what's given.

First, there's a detailed explanation of prime numbers, their properties, examples, twin primes, Mersenne primes, and Sophie Germain primes. Then, there are some specific facts like the number of known primes as of 2023 and who discovered them.

Looking at the RDF data provided, it includes various resources related to prime numbers, such as different types and specific individuals known for their work in this area, like Heinrich Scherk and Landon Curt Noll. There are also mentions of templates used on Wikipedia pages about primes.

I should create questions that cover these aspects. Let me think of potential questions:

1. What defines a prime number?
2. Can you give examples of prime numbers less than 50?
3. What are twin primes, and can you provide some examples?
4. Who discovered the largest known Mersenne prime as of 2023?
5. How many known Mersenne primes were there in 2018?
6. What is a Sophie Germain prime?
7. Which famous mathematician contributed to the study of prime numbers?
8. Who are some notable researchers in prime number theory?
9. How does one verify if a large number is prime?
10. What role do primes play in cryptography?

Now, I'll formulate each question and provide the corresponding answer based on the given information.

For example:
Q: What defines a prime number?
A: A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. For instance, 2, 3, 5, and 7 are primes because they cannot be formed by multiplying two smaller natural numbers.

I'll follow this format for all ten pairs.

**Question-Answer Pairs:**

1. **Q:** What defines a prime number?  
   **A:** A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. Examples include 2, 3, 5, and 7.

2. **Q:** Can you give examples of prime numbers less than 50?  
   **A:** Prime numbers less than 50 are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, and 47.

3. **Q:** What are twin primes, and can you provide some examples?  
   **A:** Twin primes are pairs of primes that differ by two. Examples include (3,5), (5,7), (11,13), and (17,19).

4. **Q:** Who discovered the largest known Mersenne prime as of 2023?  
   **A:** The largest known Mersenne prime as of 2023 was discovered by Patrick Laroche.

5. **Q:** How many known Mersenne primes were there in 2018?  
   **A:** As of 2018, there were 51 known Mersenne primes.

6. **Q:** What is a Sophie Germain prime?  
   **A:** A Sophie Germain prime is a prime number p such that 2p + 1 is also prime. Examples include 2, 3, and 5.

7. **Q:** Which famous mathematician contributed to the study of prime numbers?  
   **A:** Carl Friedrich Gauss made significant contributions to the study of prime numbers.

8. **Q:** Who are some notable researchers in prime number theory?  
   **A:** Notable researchers include Landon Curt Noll, known for discovering large primes, and others like Patrick Laroche.

9. **Q:** How does one verify if a large number is prime?  
   **A:** Verifying the primality of large numbers often involves advanced algorithms such as the Lucas-Lehmer test for Mersenne primes or elliptic curve methods.

10. **Q:** What role do primes play in cryptography?  
    **A:** Prime numbers are fundamental in cryptographic systems, particularly in public-key encryption methods like RSA, where their properties ensure secure data transmission.
