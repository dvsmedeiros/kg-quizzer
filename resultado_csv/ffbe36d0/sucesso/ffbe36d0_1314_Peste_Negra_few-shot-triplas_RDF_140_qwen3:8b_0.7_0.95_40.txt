Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs based on the provided context about the Black Death. Let me start by reading through the context carefully to understand all the key points.

First, the Black Death was a pandemic that caused massive deaths in Eurasia, peaking in Europe between 1347-1351. The cause is Yersinia pestis, leading to bubonic, septicemic, and pneumonic plague. It originated in Central or Eastern Asia, spread via the Silk Road to Crimea, then by Genoese ships to the Mediterranean and Europe. It killed 30-60% of Europe's population, reducing the world population from 475 million to 350-375 million in the 14th century. Europe's population took 200 years to recover, with some areas like Florence recovering only in the 19th century. It returned as outbreaks until the early 20th century.

Now, I need to create varied questions covering different aspects. Let me list possible topics: origin, spread, death toll, impact on Europe, population recovery, causes, duration, related facts from the ontology, and maybe some specific details from the examples provided.

For each question, the answer must be directly from the text. Avoid repetition. Let me check the examples given to see the style. The examples include origin, spread via ships, death percentage, recovery time, etc. So I need to ensure the new questions are different but still relevant.

Let me start drafting:

1. What was the primary cause of the Black Death? (Answer: Yersinia pestis)
2. Which regions were most affected by the Black Death? (Answer: Europe and North Africa)
3. How did the Black Death spread from Asia to Europe? (Answer: via the Silk Road to Crimea, then by Genoese ships)
4. What percentage of Europe's population died from the Black Death? (Answer: 30 to 60%)
5. How long did it take for Europe's population to recover from the Black Death? (Answer: about 200 years)
6. What was the estimated global population reduction due to the Black Death? (Answer: from 475 million to 350-375 million)
7. When did the Black Death first reach England? (Answer: seventh year after it began, around 1347)
8. Which disease is associated with the term "plague pandemic"? (Answer: Black Death)
9. How many times did the Black Death resurface after its initial outbreak? (Answer: as outbreaks until the early 20th century)
10. What is the significance of the 1338-39 dates mentioned in the context? (Answer: related to the onset of the plague in China)

Wait, the ontology mentions some dates like 1338-39 and 1331. The examples also include questions about the Chinese famine starting in 1331. So maybe the 1338-39 dates are about the onset in China. Need to check the context again.

In the context, under the ontology, there's a mention of "Category:1340s_in_Asia" and "Category:1338-39". Also, the examples have a question about the Chinese famine starting in 1331. So the 1338-39 dates might be about the beginning of the plague in China, leading to the famine. So the answer for the question about the 1338-39 dates would be "related to the onset of the plague in China."

Let me structure these into 10 questions, making sure each is distinct and answers are accurate.
