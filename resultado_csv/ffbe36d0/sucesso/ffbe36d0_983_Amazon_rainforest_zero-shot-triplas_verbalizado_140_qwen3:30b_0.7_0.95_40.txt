Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs based on the given context and facts about the Amazon rainforest. Let me start by reading through the context carefully to understand the key points.

The context mentions that the Amazon is a tropical rainforest covering the Amazon Basin, spanning 7 million km², with 5.5 million km² of forest. It's in nine countries, mostly Brazil (60%), then Peru (13%), and others. It's the largest biome in Brazil, part of the Amazon Legal region, and has biodiversity. There's info about UNESCO recognition, the Amazon's role in the environment, and some facts about images and categories.

Now, the facts list a lot of technical details, like image names, models used on Wikipedia, types (like ProtectedArea, Vegetation108436759), coordinates, and other metadata. But I need to focus on the context provided, not the facts, since the user said to generate questions based on the context and facts, but the examples in the context are the main source.

Wait, the user says "exclusivamente a partir do conteúdo fornecido" (exclusively from the provided content). So I need to make sure the questions and answers are based on the context and the facts listed. But the facts seem to be more about technical data, like image names, models, etc. However, the context is more about geographical and environmental information.

But the user's example in the context includes both the general info and the facts. However, the instruction says to generate based on the context and facts provided. But the user might have included some facts that are not directly relevant. I need to check which parts are relevant.

The key points from the context are:

- Amazon rainforest's definition and alternative names.
- Area covered (7 million km², 5.5 million km² forest).
- Countries it spans (Brazil 60%, Peru 13%, others).
- Part of Brazil's Amazon Legal region.
- Biodiversity and UNESCO recognition.
- Historical aspects like SUDAM creation in 1966.
- Some facts about images and categories (but maybe not relevant for the questions unless they are part of the content).

But the user's instruction says to generate questions based on the context and facts. However, the facts include things like image names, models, coordinates, etc. But the user might expect questions about the context, not the technical facts. However, the user included both context and facts. So I need to check if the facts are part of the content to base the questions on.

But the user's example in the context includes both the general info and the facts. However, the user's instruction says to generate questions based on the context and facts provided. So I need to consider both.

But the user might have included some facts that are not directly relevant. For example, "Amazon rainforest possui imagem representativa Walking tree.jpg" – but that's an image name. Unless the question is about the images, but the context doesn't mention specific images. The context does mention some images in the facts, like "Aerial view of the Amazon rainforest near Manaus" as a legend. So maybe some questions can be about that.

But I need to make sure that the questions are based on the context and facts. So I need to look for information in both the context and the facts.

Looking at the facts, there are mentions of:

- Countries where the Amazon is located: Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, French Guiana, Guyana, Peru, Suriname, Venezuela.
- Coordinates: WGS84 POINT(-60 -3)
- Images with specific names and descriptions.
- Models used on Wikipedia pages.
- Types like ProtectedArea, Vegetation108436759, etc.
- Some people who died in the Amazon (Guillermo Cervantes, Maria Koepcke).
- Events like UNESCO recognition in 2000.
- The Amazon Legal area in Brazil.
- The Amazon as a biome in Brazil.

So possible questions could be:

1. Which country contains the largest portion of the Amazon rainforest? (Answer: Brazil with 60%)
2. What is the total area covered by the Amazon rainforest? (7 million km²)
3. Which countries are part of the Amazon rainforest? (List them)
4. What is the name of the region in Brazil that includes the Amazon? (Amazon Legal)
5. When was the Amazon Legal region established? (1966 with SUDAM)
6. What is the significance of the Amazon rainforest in terms of biodiversity? (Largest biome, high biodiversity)
7. Which UNESCO site is the Amazon rainforest recognized as? (Not sure, but the context mentions UNESCO recognition in 2000)
8. What is the coordinate of the Amazon rainforest? (-3.0 -60.0)
9. Which people died in the Amazon rainforest? (Guillermo Cervantes, Maria Koepcke)
10. What is the name of the Amazon in Portuguese? (Floresta amazônica)

But need to check if these are all in the context or facts. For example, the coordinates are in the facts, but the context doesn't mention them. The context does mention the Amazon Legal region and SUDAM in 1966. The UNESCO recognition is in the context.

So I need to make sure the answers are based on the context. For example, the question about the largest country is in the context. The coordinates are in the facts, but maybe not in the context. However, the user included both context and facts, so maybe it's allowed.

But the user's instruction says "exclusivamente a partir do conteúdo fornecido" (exclusively from the provided content). So if the facts are part of the content, then questions based on them are allowed.

So I can create questions based on both the context and the facts. For example:

- What is the name of the Amazon rainforest in Portuguese? (Floresta amazônica)
- What is the name of the Amazon rainforest in Spanish? (Selva amazónica)
- Which models are used on Wikipedia pages for the Amazon rainforest? (Template:Infobox forest, etc.)
- What is the coordinate of the Amazon rainforest? (-3.0 -60.0)
- What is the name of the image showing deforestation in Maranhão? (Deforestation in the Maranhão state of Brazil, 2016)
- What is the name of the image showing wildfires in Brazil's indigenous territory? (Wildfires in Brazil's indigenous territory, 2017)
- What is the name of the image showing the Amazon's deforestation over time? (Timelapse of the deforestation 1984–2018)
- What is the name of the image showing the Amazon's climate change impact? (Climate change disturbances of rainforests infographic.jpg)
- What is the name of the image showing the Amazon's biodiversity? (Many parrots -Anangu, Yasuni National Park, Ecuador -clay lick-8.jpg)
- What is the name of the image showing the Amazon's geography? (Amazon rainforest (orthographic projection).svg)

But the user might prefer questions based on the context rather than the image names. However, the user's instruction says to use both context and facts. So I need to check if the facts are part of the content.

In the user's message, the "context" and "facts" are both provided. So I can use both. However, the user's example in the context includes the general information, and the facts are additional data. So I can create questions based on both.

But to make sure, I'll focus on the context for the main questions and use the facts where applicable. For example, the coordinates from the facts can be a question. Also, the names of the images with their legends can be used.

So compiling 10 pairs:

1. Which country contains the largest portion of the Amazon rainforest? (Brazil)
2. What is the total area covered by the Amazon rainforest? (7 million km²)
3. What is the name of the Amazon rainforest in Portuguese? (Floresta amazônica)
4. What is the coordinate of the Amazon rainforest? (-3.0 -60.0)
5. Which region in Brazil includes the Amazon rainforest? (Amazon Legal)
6. When was the Amazon Legal region established? (1966)
7. What is the name of the Amazon rainforest in Spanish? (Selva amazónica)
8. What is the significance of the Amazon rainforest in terms of biodiversity? (It is the largest tropical rainforest with high biodiversity)
9. What is the name of the image showing deforestation in Maranhão? (Deforestation in the Maranhão state of Brazil, 2016)
10. What is the name of the image showing the Amazon's deforestation over time? (Timelapse of the deforestation 1984–2018)

I need to check if these answers are present in the context or facts. For example, the coordinates are in the facts, the names in Portuguese and Spanish are in the facts. The Amazon Legal region is in the context. The 1966 date is in the context (SUDAM created in 1966). The image names are in the facts.

So these should be valid. Now, phrasing them as questions and answers.
