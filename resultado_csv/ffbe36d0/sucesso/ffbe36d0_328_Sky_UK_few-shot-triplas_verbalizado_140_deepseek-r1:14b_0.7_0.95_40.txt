Okay, so I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs based on the given context about British Satellite Broadcasting (BSB). The questions should be varied and cover different aspects of the content. Each question must have a single correct answer that's either explicitly stated or can be inferred from the provided facts.

First, let me read through all the facts carefully to understand what information is available. 

From the context:
- BSB was a TV company based in London.
- It was incorporated into British Sky Broadcasting (BSkyB) in November 1990.
- Started broadcasting on March 25, 1990.
- Founded in December 11, 1986.
- Located at Marco Polo House in London, England.
- The company was succeeded by Sky UK after merging with Sky Television to form BSkyB.
- BSB had several TV channels like The Movie Channel, The Power Station, Galaxy, and Now under its ownership.
- It used various wiki templates on its page.
- It's categorized under mass media companies, established in 1986, disestablished in 1990, etc.

Now, I need to create questions that touch on different areas like when it was founded, where it was located, what happened to it, its channels, and the merger with Sky Television.

Let me start brainstorming possible questions:

1. When was BSB founded? (1986)
2. What year did BSB merge to form BSkyB? (1990)
3. Where was BSB's headquarters located? (London or England)
4. Which company succeeded BSB? (Sky UK)
5. Name a TV channel owned by BSB. (The Movie Channel, etc.)
6. What was the name of the merged company? (BSkyB)
7. When did BSB start broadcasting? (March 25, 1990)
8. Under what category is BSB listed? (Mass media companies established in 1986)
9. What was BSB's headquarters building called? (Marco Polo House)
10. Which film was produced by BSB? (Memphis Belle or Hardware)

Wait, I need to ensure each question has a unique correct answer and isn't repetitive. Let me check for any overlaps.

I also need to make sure the answers are directly supported by the facts provided. For example, "BSB's headquarters" is in London/England, but one fact mentions Marco Polo House specifically.

Let me structure these into 10 distinct questions:

1. When was BSB founded? Answer: 1986
2. What year did BSB merge to form BSkyB? Answer: 1990
3. Where were BSB's headquarters located? Answer: London, England
4. Which company succeeded BSB after its merger? Answer: Sky UK
5. Name one of the TV channels owned by BSB before the merger. Answer: The Movie Channel (or others)
6. What was the name of the company formed from the merger of BSB and Sky Television? Answer: BSkyB
7. When did BSB start broadcasting services? Answer: March 25, 1990
8. Under what category is BSB classified in terms of establishment? Answer: Mass media companies established in 1986
9. What was the name of the building where BSB was headquartered? Answer: Marco Polo House
10. Which film was produced by BSB? Answer: Memphis Belle or Hardware (film)

I think these cover a range of aspects without repeating similar questions. Each has a clear, correct answer from the provided facts.
