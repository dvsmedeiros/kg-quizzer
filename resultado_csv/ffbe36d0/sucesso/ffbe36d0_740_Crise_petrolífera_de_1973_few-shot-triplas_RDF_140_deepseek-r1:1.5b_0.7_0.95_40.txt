Okay, I need to create exactly 10 pairs of questions and answers based on the provided context and facts. The context talks about the 1973 oil crisis in the United States, including the beginning, key events, and some subsequent challenges like the 1979 oil crisis. 

First, I should identify various aspects of the crisis to form different questions. Let's brainstorm:

1. When did the crisis start? (Given as "outubro de 1973" but maybe ask when it began.)
2. What was the price like before and after the crisis.
3. Who were the key players involved?
4. Why were certain countries affected more than others?
5. Was there an international response or intervention during the crisis?
6. How did the oil prices change over time post-crisis?
7. What other crises happened right after?
8. Who organized the initial embargo?
9. Where did Henry Kissinger get his address from when he made a certain statement?
10. What specific actions did the U.S. take during the crisis that were significant?

Now, I'll structure each question and answer pair accordingly, ensuring they cover different angles of the crisis as outlined.
