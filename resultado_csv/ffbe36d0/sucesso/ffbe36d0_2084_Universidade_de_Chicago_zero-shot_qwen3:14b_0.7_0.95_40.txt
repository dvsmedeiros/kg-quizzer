Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs based on the context provided, which is "Universidade_de_Chicago". The user wants each pair in Portuguese, and they need to be in a JSON format. Let me start by recalling information about the University of Chicago.

First, I should think about the key aspects of the University of Chicago. It's a prestigious university in the US, known for its research and academic programs. Let me list some facts:

1. Founded in 1890.
2. Located in Chicago, Illinois.
3. Part of the Association of American Universities.
4. Known for economics, law, and social sciences.
5. Home to the University of Chicago Press.
6. Nobel laureates affiliated with the university.
7. The Booth School of Business.
8. The Law School is highly ranked.
9. The university has a strong emphasis on research.
10. The university's mascot is the Maroons.

Now, I need to form questions that cover these different aspects without repeating similar ones. Each question must have a clear answer from the context. Let me check if the facts are correct. For example, the founding year is 1890, location is Chicago, Illinois. The University of Chicago Press is indeed associated with the university. Nobel laureates are a key point, as the university has many. The schools like Booth and Law School are important. The mascot is the Maroons, which is correct.

Wait, I need to ensure that each answer is explicitly stated or inferable from the context. Since the context is just the name "Universidade_de_Chicago", maybe I need to use general knowledge about the university. But the user mentioned that the questions must be based on the content provided. However, in this case, the context is just the name. That might be a problem. Wait, looking back at the user's message, the context is "Universidade_de_Chicago", but there's no additional content. That's confusing. How can I generate questions and answers without any specific information about the university? Maybe the user intended to provide more context but forgot. But according to the given context, there's no additional info. Hmm, this is a problem. Without specific details, I can't create accurate Q&A pairs. However, the user might expect me to use general knowledge about the University of Chicago. Let me proceed under that assumption, even though the context is minimal.

So, using general knowledge, I can create questions like:

1. When was the University of Chicago founded?
Answer: 1890.

2. Where is the University of Chicago located?
Answer: Chicago, Illinois.

3. Which prestigious academic organization is the University of Chicago part of?
Answer: Association of American Universities.

4. What is the name of the business school at the University of Chicago?
Answer: Booth School of Business.

5. What is the name of the university's publishing house?
Answer: University of Chicago Press.

6. Which university school is known for its law program?
Answer: The Law School.

7. What is the mascot of the University of Chicago?
Answer: The Maroons.

8. How many Nobel laureates have been affiliated with the University of Chicago?
Answer: Over 90 (though exact number might vary, but this is a common fact).

9. What is the university's emphasis in education?
Answer: Research.

10. What is the name of the university's press?
Answer: University of Chicago Press. (Wait, already used that. Need to vary.)

Wait, maybe I can ask about the first Nobel laureate from the university or something else. Alternatively, check if there are other notable aspects. The university's medical center, the Graham School, or the Chicago Theological Seminary. But without specific info, it's tricky. Let me make sure each question is unique and covers different areas. Also, need to ensure answers are correct. Let me verify:

- Founded in 1890: Correct.
- Located in Chicago, Illinois: Correct.
- Part of AAU: Correct.
- Booth School of Business: Correct.
- University of Chicago Press: Correct.
- Law School: Correct.
- Maroons mascot: Correct.
- Nobel laureates: Yes, over 90 as of recent years.
- Research emphasis: Yes, the university is research-focused.
- Medical school: University of Chicago Medicine.

That's 10. Now, let me structure them into JSON. Each question and answer pair. Make sure they are in Portuguese. Let me translate:

1. Quando a Universidade de Chicago foi fundada?
Resposta: 1890.

2. Onde está localizada a Universidade de Chicago?
Resposta: Chicago, Illinois.

3. A Universidade de Chicago é parte de qual organização acadêmica prestigiada?
Resposta: Associação Americana de Universidades.

4. Qual o nome da escola de negócios da Universidade de Chicago?
Resposta: Booth School of Business.

5. Qual o nome da casa editorial da Universidade de Chicago?
Resposta: University of Chicago Press.

6. Qual escola da Universidade de Chicago é conhecida por seu programa de direito?
Resposta: A Faculdade de Direito.

7. Qual é o mascote da Universidade de Chicago?
Resposta: Os Maroons.

8. Quantos laureados com o Prêmio Nobel estão associados à Universidade de Chicago?
Resposta: Mais de 90.

9. Qual é o foco educacional da Universidade de Chicago?
Resposta: Pesquisa.

10. Qual é o nome do centro médico da Universidade de Chicago?
Resposta: University of Chicago Medicine.

Now, check for repetition. Each question is different, and answers are unique. That should cover 10 pairs. Let me structure the JSON accordingly.
