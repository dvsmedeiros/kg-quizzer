Okay, so I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs based on the examples provided. Let me look at the examples first to understand what's expected.

In the examples, each pair consists of a question and a short answer. The questions seem to be related to private schools, their characteristics, financing, terminology, etc. For instance:

- One question asks about another name for private schools along with non-governmental and non-state ones, and the answer is "independentes."
- Another asks what type of scholarships are alongside sports and arts, and the answer is "acadêmicas."

Looking at the data provided earlier, it's a list of URLs pointing to DBpedia resources about various educational institutions. Each URL seems to represent a specific school or educational institution.

My task is to create similar question-answer pairs but now I need to generate 10 new ones based on the given data and following the same structure as the examples. The questions should be about private schools, their features, terminology related to them, etc., and the answers should be concise, often a noun or short phrase.

I should think of various aspects of private schools. For example:

- Types of financing (e.g., tuition instead of taxes)
- Characteristics (e.g., selective admission)
- Related terms (e.g., independent schools, preparatory schools)
- Cost-related questions
- Regional terminology differences

Let me brainstorm some potential questions and answers.

1. What is another term for private schools besides non-governmental and non-state ones? Answer: Independentes.
2. Alongside sports and arts, what type of scholarships do private schools offer? Answer: Acadêmicas.
3. Instead of taxation, how are private schools mainly funded? Answer: Through tuition fees.
4. What right do private schools have that public schools don't? Answer: The right to select their students.
5. How much does a notable preparatory school in New England cost annually? Answer: Around $45,000.
6. What are private schools that don't charge fees called? Answer: "Sem taxa."
7. Which countries besides Canada and the UK don't typically refer to universities as private schools? Answer: Australia.
8. In which region is "private school" commonly used to refer to universities? Answer: North America.
9. What's another term for the 12th grade in education? Answer: Sixth form.
10. What's another term for the 13th year of study? Answer: Sixth year.

Wait, I think some of these might overlap with the examples given, but they are similar. Maybe I can rephrase or adjust to make them distinct.

Let me check if my answers fit the structure and are concise as in the examples.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look at the data provided (the list of URLs) and extract information from there to form questions. But since each URL points to a specific school, it might be challenging without more context. However, maybe I can infer general facts about private schools from that data.

Another approach is to think of other aspects:

- What are the benefits of attending a private school? Maybe autonomy or better facilities.
- How do private schools differ in governance?
- What are the common subjects taught in these institutions?

Wait, perhaps it's better to stick with the examples and focus on terminology, financing, and structure.

Let me try again:

1. Besides non-governmental and non-state schools, what is another name for private schools? Answer: Independentes.
2. Alongside sports and arts scholarships, what are academic scholarships based on? Answer: Academic merit.
3. What do private schools often offer that public schools don't? Answer: Selective admission.
4. How much might tuition be at a top private high school in the US? Answer: Approximately $50,000 annually.
5. What are fee-free private schools called? Answer: "Escolas sem taxas."
6. Which countries don't commonly use "private school" for universities? Answer: Australia and New Zealand.
7. In which region is "private school" mainly used for higher education institutions? Answer: América do Norte.
8. What grade comes after 12th grade in some systems? Answer: Sixth form.
9. What's another term for the final year of high school? Answer: Senior year.
10. How are private schools funded if not by taxes? Answer: Through tuition and donations.

Hmm, I think these could work. They cover various aspects about private schools as per the examples given. Let me check if each answer is concise and fits the structure.
