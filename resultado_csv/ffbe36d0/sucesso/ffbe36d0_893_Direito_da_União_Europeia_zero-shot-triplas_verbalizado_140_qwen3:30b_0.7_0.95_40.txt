Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants 10 pairs of questions and answers in Portuguese, based on the provided context and facts. First, I need to make sure I understand the context and facts correctly.

The context talks about EU laws, their origin, objectives, institutions, and the Court of Justice's statement. The facts mention things like the Common Market Law Review, John Bell, Henry G. Schermers, and some wiki templates. 

I need to generate questions that are varied and cover different aspects. Let me start by listing possible angles: origin of EU laws, objectives, institutions, the role of the Court of Justice, key figures, disciplines, and specific facts like the wiki templates.

Wait, the facts include things like "Law of the European Union possui tópico principal Law of the European Union" – maybe that's redundant, but perhaps it's a way to mention the main topic. Also, the fact that John Bell and Henry G. Schermers are associated with the discipline. The wiki templates are also part of the facts.

I need to make sure each question is unique and not repetitive. Let me brainstorm:

1. What is the main topic of the Law of the European Union? (From the fact that it's the main topic)
2. What is the objective of the EU as per the context? (Promote peace, values, well-being)
3. What institutions does the EU have? (Political, social, economic)
4. What does the Court of Justice say about the EU? (New legal order)
5. Which journal operates in the discipline? (Common Market Law Review)
6. Who is a legal scholar in this field? (John Bell)
7. What areas does John Bell work in? (Law of the European Union)
8. What is Henry G. Schermers? (Subdiscipline)
9. What wiki templates are used? (Template:R from word rearrangement, etc.)
10. What is the origin of EU laws? (Post-WWII, Coal and Steel Community)

Wait, the facts mention "Law of the European Union usa modelo de página wiki Template:R from word rearrangement" – so the answer would be that specific template. Similarly for the other templates. 

I need to check that each answer is directly from the context or facts. For example, the Court of Justice's statement is in the context. The institutions are political, social, economic. 

Make sure not to repeat similar questions. For example, one about the main topic, another about the objective, another about institutions, another about the Court, then the journals, scholars, subdisciplines, and the wiki templates. That should cover different aspects.

Now, translate these into Portuguese, ensuring the questions are clear and the answers are exact. Also, check that each pair is unique and not overlapping. Let me verify each one against the context and facts to ensure accuracy.
