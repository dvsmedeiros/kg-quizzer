Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs based on the provided context and facts about British Satellite Broadcasting (BSB). Let me start by carefully reading through all the given information to identify key points.

First, the context mentions that BSB was a UK-based satellite TV company, incorporated in November 1990 to form BSkyB, and started broadcasting on March 25, 1990. Wait, that seems a bit conflicting because the founding date is listed as 1986-12-11. So, the company was founded in December 1986, started transmitting in March 1990, and merged with Sky Television in 1990 to form BSkyB. Also, BSB was headquartered in London, United Kingdom, and had several TV channels like The Movie Channel, The Power Station, and Galaxy. They produced films such as Memphis Belle and Hardware. They had various Wikipedia templates and categories related to their operations and history.

Now, I need to create 10 varied questions that cover different aspects. Let me list out the key facts again to ensure I don't miss any important points:

- Founded in 1986-12-11
- Started transmitting in 1990-03-25
- Merged with Sky Television to form BSkyB in 1990
- Based in London, United Kingdom
- Owned several TV channels (The Movie Channel, The Power Station, Galaxy, etc.)
- Produced films like Memphis Belle and Hardware
- Has specific Wikipedia templates and categories
- Disestablished in 1990
- Located at Marco Polo House in England
- Has multiple images and identifiers (Q numbers, etc.)

I need to make sure each question is unique and covers different aspects. Let me think of possible questions:

1. When was BSB founded?
2. What was the start date of BSB's transmissions?
3. Which company did BSB merge with to form BSkyB?
4. Where is BSB headquartered?
5. Which TV channel is owned by BSB?
6. What films did BSB produce?
7. What Wikipedia template does BSB use?
8. What category does BSB belong to?
9. What is the location of BSB's headquarters?
10. When was BSB disestablished?

Wait, some of these might be similar. Let me check the facts again. Also, the answer for the merger is Sky Television, and the disestablishment is 1990. The headquarters are in London, United Kingdom, and Marco Polo House in England. The TV channels are The Movie Channel, The Power Station, Galaxy, and others. The films are Memphis Belle and Hardware. The templates include Template:Cite web, Template:Authority control, etc. The categories include Category:1990s in British television, etc.

I need to ensure each question is distinct. Let me structure each pair carefully, making sure the answers are directly from the provided data. Also, avoid repetition. For example, questions about location should be distinct (headquarters vs. specific address). The merger and disestablishment are different points. Let me proceed to create the 10 pairs.
