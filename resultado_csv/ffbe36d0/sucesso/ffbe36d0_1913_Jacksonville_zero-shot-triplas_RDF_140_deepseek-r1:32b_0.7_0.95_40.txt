Okay, so I'm trying to come up with 10 question and answer pairs about Jacksonville, Florida based on the information provided. First, I need to look through all the data given about the city. There's a lot there—everything from population stats to famous people, landmarks, sports teams, nicknames, climate, economy, etc.

Let me start by skimming through the list of resources and facts. I see that Jacksonville is in Florida, it's part of Duval County, and it's on the St. Johns River. It has a population metro area of around 1.7 million. The city was established in 1822, so that's when it was founded. 

I notice there are several nicknames mentioned: "Jax," "The River City," and "The Bold New City of the South." That's a good point to include in an answer. Also, the climate section mentions average temperatures—like February low being 46°F and June precipitation at 7.6 inches.

Looking further down, there are mentions of sports teams like the Jacksonville Jaguars (NFL) and the Jacksonville Dolphins (MLB). There's also information about universities such as University of Florida College of Pharmacy and Florida State College of Jacksonville.

Economically, it's a hub for banking and insurance companies like Bank of America and CSX Transportation. The port is significant too—Port of Jacksonville is one of the biggest in the US by tonnage.

I should structure each question to target specific information without overlapping too much. Maybe start with basic facts like location, population, nicknames, founding year, climate data, sports teams, education institutions, economic sectors, notable landmarks, and historical sites.

Wait, I need 10 pairs. Let me list potential questions:

1. Where is Jacksonville located?
2. What's the population of its metro area?
3. When was it founded?
4. What are its nicknames?
5. What's the average low temperature in February?
6. Which sports teams are based there?
7. Name a university in Jacksonville.
8. What's a major economic activity?
9. Any famous landmarks?
10. What about historical sites?

That should cover a range of topics without repeating info. Now, I'll need to extract the answers from the provided data for each of these questions.

For example, the location is Florida, so answer that. Population metro is 1.7 million. Founded in 1822. Nicknames include Jax, The River City, etc. Average low in Feb is 46°F. Sports teams are Jaguars and Dolphins. University could be Florida State College of Jacksonville. Economic activity includes banking and insurance. Landmarks like St. Johns River and Fort Caroline. Historical sites might include Kingsley Plantation.

Wait, I should make sure each answer directly references the data without adding external info. Also, keep the answers concise.

I think that's a solid approach. Now, let me put it all together into 10 clear Q&A pairs based on these points.
