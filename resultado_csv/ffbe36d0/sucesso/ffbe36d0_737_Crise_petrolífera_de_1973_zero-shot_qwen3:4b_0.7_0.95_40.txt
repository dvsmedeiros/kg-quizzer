Okay, the user wants me to generate 10 objective questions and answers based on the provided context about the 1973 oil crisis. Let me start by understanding the context. The user mentioned "Crise_petrolífera_de_1973," which is the 1973 oil crisis. I need to make sure I cover different aspects of this event.

First, I should recall the key points of the 1973 oil crisis. It was triggered by the Yom Kippur War, where Arab oil-producing countries, led by OPEC, imposed an oil embargo on countries that supported Israel. The embargo lasted about 18 days and led to a sharp increase in oil prices, causing economic disruptions globally. The crisis had significant impacts on the US, Europe, and other countries, leading to energy shortages and economic recessions.

Now, I need to create 10 distinct questions. Let me brainstorm possible topics: causes, key events, economic impacts, OPEC's role, the embargo duration, the war it was linked to, the countries involved, the price increase, the effects on the US, and the long-term consequences.

I should check that each question is unique and covers different aspects. Let me start listing them:

1. What event triggered the 1973 oil crisis?
2. Which countries imposed an oil embargo?
3. What was the duration of the oil embargo?
4. What was the primary cause of the oil price increase?
5. What was the economic impact of the crisis on the US?
6. What role did OPEC play in the crisis?
7. Which war was the oil crisis directly linked to?
8. What were the long-term consequences of the crisis?
9. How did the crisis affect the global economy?
10. What was the main consequence of the embargo for the United States?

Wait, I need to make sure the answers are accurate. For example, the embargo was 18 days, the Yom Kippur War was the trigger, OPEC countries imposed the embargo, the US was hit hard with energy shortages and economic recession, etc. Also, the answer to the 8th question about long-term consequences would include the shift to alternative energy and economic reforms.

I need to check that each answer is correctly derived from the context. Also, ensure that the questions are in Portuguese and the answers are in Portuguese as well. Make sure not to repeat similar questions. Let me verify each one again to ensure they are distinct and cover different aspects. Once that's done, format them into the JSON structure as specified.
