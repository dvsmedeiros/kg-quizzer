Okay, the user wants me to generate 10 objective questions and answers based on the context provided, which is "Sul_da_Califórnia". First, I need to make sure I understand the context. Since the user provided the context as "Sul_da_Califórnia", I assume that's the main topic. But wait, "Sul_da_Califórnia" is in Portuguese, which translates to "South of California" or "Southern California". However, that seems a bit confusing because California is a state in the United States, and "South of California" would be a region, but I need to check if there's a specific area or region referred to here.

Wait, maybe the user is referring to "Sul da Califórnia" as the southern part of California, which is a well-known region. So, the context is about the southern part of California. The user wants 10 questions and answers in Portuguese, based on this context. But the problem is that the user hasn't provided any specific content or information about this region. The original instruction says to generate questions based on the context and facts provided, but the only given context is "Sul_da_Califórnia". That's very vague. How can I generate questions without any specific information about it?

Wait, maybe the user is referring to a specific article or text that's not provided here. But according to the user's message, the context is "Sul_da_Califórnia", but no other content. So maybe the user is expecting me to use general knowledge about Southern California to create the questions. But the user mentioned that the questions should be based on the context and facts provided. Since the context is just "Sul_da_Califórnia", perhaps the user is testing if I can generate questions about that region without specific details. However, that's a problem because without specific facts, the questions might be too generic.

Alternatively, maybe the user made a mistake and forgot to provide the actual content. But given the information, I need to proceed. Since the user said "Sul_da_Califórnia" as the context, perhaps the intended content is about the southern part of California, which is a region with various characteristics. So, I can create questions about its geography, culture, economy, famous landmarks, etc. But I need to ensure that the answers are correct based on general knowledge.

Wait, but the user might have intended that "Sul_da_Califórnia" is a specific topic, but without more information, I have to rely on general knowledge. Let me try to list possible topics related to Southern California. For example, major cities like Los Angeles, San Diego, San Francisco, but wait, San Francisco is actually in Northern California. So maybe the southern part includes Los Angeles, Santa Barbara, San Diego, etc. Also, famous landmarks like the Hollywood Sign, Disneyland, the beach areas, the Santa Monica Pier, the Pacific Coast Highway, the Orange County, the Coachella Valley, the San Gabriel Mountains, etc.

So, the questions could be about the major cities, famous landmarks, geographical features, cultural aspects, economic activities, etc. Since the user wants 10 pairs, I need to make sure each question is unique and covers different aspects. Also, the answers must be correct based on the general knowledge of Southern California.

Let me start drafting the questions. For example:

1. Qual é a capital da região de Sul_da_Califórnia?
   Answer: Los Angeles (but wait, is Los Angeles the capital? Or is that a common misconception? Actually, the capital of California is Sacramento, but that's in the northern part. So maybe the answer is Los Angeles as the largest city in the southern part.)

Wait, but the user might be referring to the southern part of California, which is a region, not a country. So, the capital of California is Sacramento, but that's not in the southern part. Therefore, the answer might be Los Angeles as the main city in the southern part. However, I need to confirm that.

Another question: Qual é o nome do maior parque de diversões na região de Sul_da_Califórnia?
   Answer: Disneyland

Another: Qual é o nome do principal porto de lazer na região de Sul_da_Califórnia?
   Answer: Santa Monica (or maybe San Diego? But Santa Monica is a major beach area.)

Wait, maybe I need to check the correct names. For example, San Diego is a major city in the southern part, but it's more of a coastal city. The main beach area is Santa Monica, which is part of Los Angeles County.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is "Los Angeles" as the main city. But the user is asking for questions based on the provided context, which is "Sul_da_Califórnia", but without specific content, the answers are based on general knowledge. So, I need to proceed with that.

Another point: The southern part of California includes areas like Orange County, San Diego, and Los Angeles. So questions about the major cities, famous landmarks, cultural aspects, etc.

I need to make sure that each question is distinct and covers different aspects. Let me try to list 10 questions with their answers, ensuring that they are accurate based on general knowledge of Southern California.
