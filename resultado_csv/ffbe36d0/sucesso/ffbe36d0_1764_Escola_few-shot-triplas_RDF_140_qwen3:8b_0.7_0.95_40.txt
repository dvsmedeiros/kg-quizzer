Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs based on the provided examples and the given list of school data. Let me start by understanding the examples to see the pattern.

Looking at the examples, the questions are about different aspects of private schools, like synonyms, funding sources, rights, costs, etc. The answers are concise, often in a specific format with commas or parentheses. For instance, the first example asks about another name for private schools, and the answer is "independentes," which means "independent" in Portuguese. 

Now, I need to create similar questions using the data provided. The data includes various schools with their types and locations. Let me check the list again. For example, there's "St. Mary's College of Quezon City" and "Washington University School of Medicine." 

Possible topics to explore could be:
1. Synonyms for private schools (like "independentes").
2. Funding sources (e.g., donations instead of taxes).
3. Rights unique to private schools (like selecting students).
4. Costs associated with certain schools.
5. Terms used in different regions for private institutions.

Let me brainstorm some questions. For example, using the school names, maybe ask about the location of a specific school. Wait, the examples don't include location-based questions, but maybe others do. Alternatively, focus on terms and definitions.

Another angle: some schools might be part of a network or have specific programs. For instance, "St. Mary's College of Quezon City" is a private institution in the Philippines. But the examples don't mention specific schools, so maybe stick to general terms.

Wait, the examples include questions about terms like "independentes" and "sem taxa" (no fee). So perhaps the next questions should follow that structure. Let me think of other terms related to private schools.

For example:
- What is another term for private schools in some regions?
- How are private schools funded instead of taxes?
- What is the term for private schools that don't charge tuition?

But the examples already have similar questions. Maybe I need to find other aspects. Let's check the list again. There's "University of Medical Sciences and Technology" and "Washington University School of Medicine." Maybe ask about the type of institution or its focus.

Alternatively, think about the structure of the examples. The first example asks for another name, and the answer is a term. Let me make sure to follow that pattern. 

Another possible question: "What is the term used for private schools that are not for-profit?" The answer might be "independent" or "non-profit," but I need to check if that's accurate. Wait, in some contexts, private schools can be for-profit or non-profit, but the examples don't cover that. Maybe not the best fit.

Alternatively, think about the cost: the example has a question about the annual cost of preparatory schools in New England. Maybe create a similar question about another region. But the examples don't mention other regions, so maybe not.

Looking at the examples again, they include questions about terminology, funding, rights, costs, and specific terms like "sem taxa" (no-fee). So perhaps the next questions should focus on these areas but with different angles.

For instance:
- What is another term for private schools in the context of higher education?
- How do private schools in certain regions differ from public ones in terms of governance?
- What is the term for private schools that are affiliated with religious institutions?

But I need to make sure the answers are concise and follow the example format. Let me try to form 10 pairs, ensuring they are varied and cover different aspects. Let me proceed step by step, making sure each pair is unique and fits the pattern.
