Additionally, the university's own properties are:,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,1.875,3.79304,1.0,0.167
Now, the steps to generate the CSV:,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,3.0,3.95066,0.83333,0.000
Now, compiling all these into the CSV.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,2.42857,3.79304,1.0,0.000
First, list all the people and their relations. Let's go through each line.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,2.5625,5.36491,1.0,0.077
Then, the university's own properties:,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,1.57143,3.43523,1.0,0.200
Now, compiling all these into the CSV.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,2.42857,3.79304,1.0,0.000
Now, let's start listing all the rows.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,2.66667,4.10211,1.0,0.143
First, the university's own properties:,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,1.57143,3.43523,1.0,0.200
Then, each person's relation:,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,1.33333,3.01273,1.0,0.250
Similarly, for <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Robert_Bork> ns1:education <http://dbpedia.org/resource/University_of_Chicago> .,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,2.0,2.50045,1.0,0.000
Now, need to go through all the triples and extract these.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,4.27273,4.82961,1.0,0.000
Looking at the data, there are many people listed with various properties. Let's count them.,1.5,3.01273,1.0,0.250,2.41667,5.20226,1.0,0.083
Now, let's proceed to generate the CSV.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,2.66667,4.10211,1.0,0.143
First, the university's properties:,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,1.33333,3.01273,1.0,0.250
Then, for each person:,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,1.25,2.50045,1.0,0.000
For example, the next line:,0.5,1.85566,1.0,0.000,1.5,2.50045,1.0,0.000
Continuing, each person's triple is processed.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,1.875,3.79304,1.0,0.167
Now, compiling all these into the CSV.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,2.42857,3.79304,1.0,0.000
Make sure that the university's own properties are each in their own row, and all the people's relations are included.,3.46667,5.63172,0.92857,0.077,2.2,4.37319,1.0,0.143
Now, the final CSV would look like this:,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,2.125,4.10211,1.0,0.286
But in the actual answer, I need to list all the rows based on the provided triples.,1.2,3.43523,1.0,0.000,3.38462,5.32781,0.91667,0.000
But given the length, perhaps I can summarize the structure and provide the first few rows and mention that the rest follow the same pattern.,1.5,3.01273,1.0,0.000,6.09091,6.73713,0.80952,0.000
But to adhere to the user's request, I'll proceed to list all the rows.,2.55556,4.51932,0.875,0.125,3.1,4.37319,1.0,0.000
First, the university's properties:,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,1.33333,3.01273,1.0,0.250
Then, the people's relations:,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,1.33333,3.01273,1.0,0.250
But since there are many people, I'll list them all as per the provided triples.,2.5,3.79304,1.0,0.000,2.41667,4.82961,1.0,0.000
Now, compiling all of them into the CSV.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,2.875,4.10211,1.0,0.000
