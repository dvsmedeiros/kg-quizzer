Okay, let me try to figure out how to approach this problem. The user has given a set of data about the Rhine River in various countries and provided some rules for formatting a CSV based on that data. My task is to generate a CSV from the data as instructed.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,3.86935,8.32936,0.82,0.106
3. The substation name (e.g., St. Gallen).,1.5,3.43523,1.0,0.000,0.75,1.85566,1.0,0.000
4. Stream name: if it's a main river, maybe just Stream.,1.1,4.61384,1.0,0.125,1.25,2.50045,1.0,0.000
5. Subdivision type and location: for countries like Switzerland, this would be the region they belong to.,1.30556,4.61384,1.0,0.000,3.33333,4.37319,1.0,0.000
I should extract each piece of information in the correct order and format it into a CSV structure, ensuring that all fields are properly labeled and separated by commas.,3.66667,6.01374,1.0,0.000,4.75,5.02467,1.0,0.000
Now, structuring each row with the required fields in order:,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,3.8,4.61384,1.0,0.000
Finally, I'll double-check for any typos or formatting issues before submitting the CSV.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,3.86667,5.36491,1.0,0.000
