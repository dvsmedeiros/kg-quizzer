Okay, so I need to generate 10 pairs of question and answer based on the given information about prime numbers. Let me start by understanding what's in the provided data.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,3.95577,7.03821,0.96667,0.069
The instructions also mention generating questions based on these facts, ensuring each pair has a question followed by an answer separated by a semicolon.,4.5,4.82961,1.0,0.000,3.53333,5.76263,0.85714,0.000
Now, I need to create 10 such pairs. Let me brainstorm possible questions:,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,1.91667,5.20226,1.0,0.000
Now, I'll need to ensure each question has a clear and concise answer based on the information given.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,4.1,6.01374,1.0,0.222
   Não, nenhum outro número par além de 2 pode ser primo porque todos os números pares maiores que 2 são divisíveis por 2.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,2.56522,6.58989,0.90909,0.538
   Os primos têm apenas dois divisores, enquanto os compostos têm três ou mais divisores.,1.16667,3.79304,1.0,0.250,1.77778,4.37319,1.0,0.000
   Incluir 1 não preserva a unicidade da fatoração, já que ele pode ser adicionado arbitrariamente.,1.125,4.37319,1.0,0.333,1.625,4.10211,1.0,0.500
   Os primos são os blocos de construção básicos dos números naturais, essenciais para sua decomposição única em fatores.,1.45455,5.1549,0.90909,0.286,1.75,4.10211,1.0,0.250
