Okay, I need to help the user generate a CSV based on the provided data and instructions. Let me first understand what they're asking for.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,3.28877,6.7216,0.96,0.043
I also need to structure this information into a CSV format. Each row in the CSV will have two columns: one for `ns1` and another for `ns2`, plus some additional rows for the extra instructions.,3.63095,6.94335,0.92593,0.000,2.44444,4.37319,1.0,0.000
force, ns2,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000
