1. For each line, extract the school name from the URL.,0.75,3.01273,1.0,0.000,3.5,4.25402,0.85714,0.000
2. Clean the name by replacing underscores with spaces, handling special characters.,2.0,4.61384,1.0,0.000,1.25,2.50045,1.0,0.000
Now, let's test a few examples. Take the first entry:,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,1.75,4.82961,1.0,0.111
Now, compiling all this into a CSV. Each row will be:,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,2.0,4.82961,1.0,0.000
School Name,Private School,0.5,1.85566,1.0,0.000,0.5,1.85566,1.0,0.000

4. Check if the cleaned name contains a comma. If yes, enclose in double quotes.,1.25926,5.1549,0.90909,0.364,2.0,3.01273,1.0,0.000
5. Write to CSV: School Name,Private School,1.16667,3.79304,1.0,0.000,0.5,1.85566,1.0,0.000
- St._Rita_School_for_the_Deaf → St. Rita School for the Deaf,Yes (no comma),2.0,4.37319,1.0,0.000,2.0,2.50045,1.0,0.000
