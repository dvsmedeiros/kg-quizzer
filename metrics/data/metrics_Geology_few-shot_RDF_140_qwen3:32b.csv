Therefore, the relevant triples are all except the last one starting with `<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Geology> ...`.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,7.0,5.1549,0.90909,0.000
Now, compiling the list:,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,1.5,2.50045,1.0,0.000
Let me verify the example in the user's mind. The sample CSV shows John Tuzo Wilson with `ns1:field`, and Underland (book) with `ns1:subject`. So the format is correct.,4.11859,6.42016,0.9,0.053,3.625,5.02467,1.0,0.000
Now, compiling all the entries into the CSV.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,2.875,4.25402,0.85714,0.000
