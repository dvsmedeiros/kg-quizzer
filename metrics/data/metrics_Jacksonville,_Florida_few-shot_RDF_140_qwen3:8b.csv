Now, let's start creating the CSV.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,2.25,3.79304,1.0,0.167
For example, the line:,0.5,1.85566,1.0,0.000,1.0,1.85566,1.0,0.000
<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jacksonville,_Florida> ns1:areaWater 329350000.0 ,1.5,1.85566,1.0,0.000,2.28571,3.01273,1.0,0.000
Similarly, for other lines.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,1.25,2.50045,1.0,0.000
Alternatively, maybe the user wants to include that even if the subject is not a city. But that's unclear.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,3.63542,6.32762,0.89474,0.056
<http://dbpedia.org/resource/NOAAS_Discoverer_(R_102)> ns1:builder <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jacksonville,_Florida> ,1.88889,3.01273,1.0,0.000,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.000
But how to handle that. For example, the line:,1.25,4.10211,1.0,0.000,1.0,1.85566,1.0,0.000
Now, let's process the data.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,1.85714,3.43523,1.0,0.400
Now, let's start building the CSV.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,2.25,3.79304,1.0,0.167
