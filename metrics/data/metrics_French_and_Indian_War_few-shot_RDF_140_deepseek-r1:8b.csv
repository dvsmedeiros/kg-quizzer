Now, thinking about the structure of the CSV output:,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,4.0,4.51932,0.875,0.000
1. The first row will be the headers, which are the predicates.,1.75,4.51932,0.875,0.000,1.6,3.01273,1.0,0.000
I also need to ensure that all data is correctly converted without missing any triples. That means I'll have to go through each line carefully and make sure none are overlooked, especially if there are many lines in the RDF data.,5.38542,7.30371,0.90625,0.031,4.27273,4.82961,1.0,0.100
7. Output the CSV with the correct structure, matching the example provided.,1.75,4.51932,0.875,0.000,2.0,3.01273,1.0,0.000
To convert the RDF data into a CSV format, we need to extract the triples and organize them accordingly. The CSV will have headers representing predicates and rows for their corresponding objects. Here's how it can be structured:,2.0,4.61384,1.0,0.125,3.78932,7.11842,0.93333,0.033
| Commander             | Jean Erdman, Baron Dieskau |,1.0,2.50045,1.0,0.000,0.5,1.85566,1.0,0.000
| Commander             | Jeffery Amherst, 1st Baron Amherst |,1.0,3.01273,1.0,0.000,1.0,2.50045,1.0,0.000
This CSV structure effectively captures the properties and their values, providing a clear and organized view of the data.,4.5,4.82961,1.0,0.000,3.2,4.61384,1.0,0.125
