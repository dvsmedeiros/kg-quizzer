Okay, I need to create a CSV file based on the given instructions and rules. Let me start by understanding what's being asked.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,3.16061,6.48214,1.0,0.048
Next, I'll go through each column one by one:,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,3.54545,4.75438,0.88889,0.000
1. **ID**: It seems like there isn't a specific ID provided in the data, so maybe this can be left blank or marked as N/A.,1.775,6.35243,0.83333,0.118,4.08333,5.02467,1.0,0.000
7. **Locks**: I don't see specific lock information provided, so this might be left blank or marked as N/A.,1.58333,5.32781,0.91667,0.083,3.63636,4.82961,1.0,0.000
I need to ensure that each piece of information is correctly extracted without missing any details. Also, I'll verify that all columns have appropriate data or are marked as N/A if information isn't available.,3.58824,5.90165,1.0,0.000,5.54545,6.11885,1.0,0.105
