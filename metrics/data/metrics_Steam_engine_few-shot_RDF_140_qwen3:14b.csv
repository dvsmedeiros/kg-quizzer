I should also pay attention to the namespaces. For example, ns1 and ns2 might represent different ontologies. The CSV should include the full predicate URI as the predicate column. ,2.25,4.82961,1.0,0.000,3.16827,6.44608,0.84211,0.000
Another thing to note is that some entries have multiple objects. For instance, the ns2:wikiPageUsesTemplate predicate has multiple templates listed. Each of these should be separate rows with the same subject and predicate but different objects.,2.625,5.36491,1.0,0.000,3.71176,6.74206,0.91667,0.000
