Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs based on the provided data about geology. Let me start by looking through the data to identify key terms and concepts related to geology. ,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,4.71111,7.43343,0.83871,0.033
There are mentions of geological surveys and journals, like the Revista de la Asociación Geológica Argentina. A question could ask about the role of such journals in geology.,3.5,4.37319,1.0,0.000,2.82479,6.31501,0.95,0.053
I also notice terms like geological time scale and plate tectonics. These are fundamental concepts. A question could be about the main theories in geology, such as plate tectonics.,3.6,6.63618,1.0,0.083,1.4,3.01273,1.0,0.000
Also, entries like underground water and karst landscapes might relate to hydrogeology. A question could ask about karst formations and their causes.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,3.96591,6.50743,0.90476,0.000
Lastly, terms like geological hazards and earthquakes are relevant. A question could ask about the causes of earthquakes.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,3.06667,6.00792,0.94118,0.000
I need to ensure each question is clear and the answers are concise, using the data provided. Let me check for 10 distinct questions and make sure they cover different aspects of geology as per the data.,6.0,5.36491,1.0,0.000,3.40476,6.74206,0.91667,0.045
**Resposta:** Rochas ígneas se formam a partir da solidificação de magma ou lava, que resfria e solidifica-se dentro da crosta terrestre ou na superfície.  ,2.0,5.76639,0.93333,0.111,2.16667,5.02467,1.0,0.600
**Resposta:** Marie Tharp, que mapeou as dorsais oceânicas e contribuiu para a descoberta da tectônica de placas.  ,2.0,3.59796,0.8,0.000,2.4,5.51466,1.0,0.143
**Resposta:** A petrificação é o processo de substituição de materiais orgânicos por minerais, preservando a estrutura de fósseis em rochas como a pedra-pomes ou a madeira fossilizada.  ,1.5,5.89204,0.86667,0.100,2.33333,5.76263,0.85714,0.286
**Resposta:** As rochas são classificadas em ígneas (formadas por magma), sedimentares (formadas por sedimentos acumulados) e metamórficas (formadas por transformação de rochas existentes sob pressão e temperatura).  ,2.35294,5.32781,0.91667,0.111,2.72727,6.25277,0.82353,0.273
**Resposta:** O karst é um ambiente geológico formado por rochas solúveis (como calcário) onde a erosão química cria cavernas, rios subterrâneos e superfícies desérticas com depressões e poços.,2.03846,6.58989,0.90909,0.125,1.9,4.75438,0.88889,0.000
