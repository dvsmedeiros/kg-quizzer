Okay, so I need to figure out how to create a CSV based on the given RDF data about steam engines. Let me start by understanding what's provided here.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,3.48918,6.98051,0.96552,0.074
Looking back at the data, most triples are about ships having `ns1:powerType` as `<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Steam_engine>`. So each ship is an entity with that power type.,2.0,3.43523,1.0,0.200,4.31494,6.21768,1.0,0.000
