But looking at the data, the line for Geology has multiple predicates. For example:,2.0,3.43523,1.0,0.200,1.5625,4.75438,0.88889,0.000
But the exact parsing needs to handle the commas and semicolons correctly. Also, the last object in each predicate might have a semicolon or a period.,3.0,5.48607,0.92308,0.000,3.92857,5.48607,0.92308,0.333
1. For each line, remove the trailing period.,0.75,3.01273,1.0,0.000,2.0,3.01273,1.0,0.000
3. For each subject, split into predicates and objects.,0.75,3.01273,1.0,0.000,2.0,3.43523,1.0,0.000
