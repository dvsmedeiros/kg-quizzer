So the CSV should include all these entities, along with their properties. The challenge is to extract all these triples and format them into a CSV.,3.5,4.37319,1.0,0.000,3.53333,6.01374,1.0,0.000
ns1:subdivision <http://dbpedia.org/resource/California>, ... etc.,1.0,1.85566,1.0,0.000,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.000
