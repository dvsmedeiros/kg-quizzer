Okay, I need to generate a CSV file based on the provided turtle data about Southern California. Let me start by understanding the data structure. ,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,3.76797,6.74206,0.91667,0.045
Looking at the data for Southern California, the properties are:,1.71429,4.10211,1.0,0.143,1.5,2.50045,1.0,0.000
I need to list these classes in the Type (class) column, possibly separated by commas. ,6.0,5.02467,1.0,0.000,1.6,3.01273,1.0,0.000
Subdivision: the data includes multiple subdivisions under ns1:subdivision and ns2:subdivisionName. The user's instruction says to include Subdivision which are the actual subdivisions listed. In the data, ns1:subdivision and ns2:subdivisionName both list the same counties. So I need to list those counties.,3.16667,7.55343,0.75862,0.071,3.13462,6.12437,0.88235,0.000
Now, the name is Southern California from ns2:name.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,4.5,4.51932,0.875,0.000
Population: since there's no property for populationTotal, I'll leave that out as per the data provided.,2.3,4.37319,1.0,0.143,2.41667,4.82961,1.0,0.100
Now, let's map each of these columns with the data from the turtle file.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,5.875,5.63172,0.92857,0.143
Country: United States (from ns1:country which is a URI to United_States, so the name is United States).,2.66667,5.32781,0.91667,0.000,3.5,3.79304,1.0,0.000
- Imperial County, California,1.0,1.85566,1.0,0.000,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000
- Los Angeles County, California,1.0,2.50045,1.0,0.000,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000
- Riverside County, California,1.0,1.85566,1.0,0.000,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000
Subdivision Type: List of counties in California, List of sovereign states (from ns2:subdivisionType).,2.0,4.10211,1.0,0.000,4.27273,4.10211,1.0,0.000
Total Population: empty, since no data.,1.5,2.50045,1.0,0.000,1.25,2.50045,1.0,0.500
- <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Imperial_County,_California>,1.85714,1.85566,1.0,0.000,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.000
- <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Los_Angeles_County,_California>,1.85714,1.85566,1.0,0.000,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.000
- <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Riverside_County,_California>,1.85714,1.85566,1.0,0.000,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.000
- Imperial County, California,1.0,1.85566,1.0,0.000,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000
- Los Angeles County, California,1.0,2.50045,1.0,0.000,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000
- Riverside County, California,1.0,1.85566,1.0,0.000,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000
Similarly, the Subdivision Name is the same as Subdivision.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,2.77778,4.69839,0.75,0.000
Based on the provided Turtle data and the specified instructions, here is the generated CSV file:,4.5,4.96484,0.9,0.100,3.0,3.79304,1.0,0.000
2. **Type (class)**: All classes listed in the Turtle data, separated by commas.,2.3125,5.32781,0.91667,0.083,1.25,2.50045,1.0,0.000
5. **Total Area in Square Miles**: Value from `ns2:areaTotalSqMi` (56,505).,2.43421,5.48607,0.92308,0.000,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.000
10. **Total Population**: No population data was provided in the input, so this field is left empty.,2.11667,5.91044,0.78571,0.077,2.42857,3.79304,1.0,0.000
