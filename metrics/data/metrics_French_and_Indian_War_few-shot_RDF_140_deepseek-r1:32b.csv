Okay, so I have this task where I need to generate a CSV file based on the given SPARQL query results and some instructions. Let me try to figure out what needs to be done step by step.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,5.26667,7.59869,0.89189,0.000
2. **Start Date**: The RDF has a property `ns2:date` with 1754-05-28. I think this is the start date. There's also an end date implied since the war ended around 1763, but it's not explicitly stated here. Maybe I can infer that or leave it blank if unsure.,3.32679,7.87732,0.77143,0.143,3.86111,6.11685,0.94444,0.056
One thing I'm unsure about is how to handle potential duplicates in the data. For instance, some commanders might appear both under `ns2:commander` and `ns1:commander`. I need to make sure they are only listed once each. Maybe using a set would help eliminate duplicates before converting them into lists.,2.80882,5.90165,1.0,0.118,5.00794,7.29329,0.97143,0.000
I also notice that the RDF includes images and templates which aren't relevant for this CSV, so I can ignore those parts.,5.38889,5.90165,1.0,0.059,3.0,3.79304,1.0,0.000
To summarize, my steps are:,0.5,1.85566,1.0,0.000,1.25,2.50045,1.0,0.000
I think I've got a plan. Now, let me put this into action and create the CSV accordingly.,0.83333,4.51932,0.875,0.500,3.58333,5.02467,1.0,0.000
