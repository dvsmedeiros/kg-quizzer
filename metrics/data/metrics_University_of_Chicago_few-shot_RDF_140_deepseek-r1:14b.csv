But that approach might not capture all the necessary information for each individual. Maybe I should include a column indicating the relationship between each entity and the University of Chicago, such as alma mater or employer.,4.67647,7.20301,0.9,0.167,2.0,3.79304,1.0,0.200
Alternatively, perhaps create two sections: one for the university with its stats and another listing all associated people with their details.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,3.95455,6.31501,0.95,0.000
2. Subsequent rows: Each individual person with their URI and name, noting that they are associated with the university.,1.79545,5.02467,1.0,0.091,3.33333,4.37319,1.0,0.000
