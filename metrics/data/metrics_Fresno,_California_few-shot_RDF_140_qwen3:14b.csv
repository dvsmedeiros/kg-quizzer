Now, processing the data line by line:,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,3.0,3.95066,0.83333,0.167
2. The next lines have predicates like ns4:areaTotal with a value, so each becomes a row.,1.875,5.20226,1.0,0.000,1.66667,3.43523,1.0,0.000
For example, the line:,0.5,1.85566,1.0,0.000,1.0,1.85566,1.0,0.000
This has two predicates and their objects. So, two rows.,1.4375,4.37319,1.0,0.000,1.0,1.85566,1.0,0.000
<http://dbpedia.org/resource/University_High_School_(Fresno)> ns2:city <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fresno,_California> .,1.88889,3.01273,1.0,0.000,1.25,1.85566,1.0,0.000
In summary, the steps are:,0.5,1.85566,1.0,0.000,1.5,2.50045,1.0,0.000
