Wait, the last line has two predicates. So I need to split that into two separate entries.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,4.0,5.89142,0.9375,0.000
Once all entries are parsed, I can create the CSV with the columns as specified.,2.0,3.43523,1.0,0.000,3.63636,4.96484,0.9,0.000
Alright, time to start processing each line and mapping the predicates to their respective types.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,6.2,5.63172,0.92857,0.071
Parece que você tentou copiar um texto repetido, mas no final houve uma digitação incorreta: **workIn立场**. Acredito que você quis dizer **workInstitution** (instituição de trabalho) ou outra palavra relacionada.,0.875,4.37319,1.0,0.400,2.75,7.07402,0.84615,0.389
