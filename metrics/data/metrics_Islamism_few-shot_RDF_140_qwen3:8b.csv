Therefore, the steps are:,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,1.5,2.50045,1.0,0.000
3. Ensure that the CSV format is correct, with proper commas and quotes if needed.,1.75,4.37319,1.0,0.000,2.875,4.10211,1.0,0.000
Now, I need to parse the data. The data starts with entries like:,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,3.0,5.47097,0.83333,0.083
Another example is the Text property, which has a long text block. That should be placed in the Text column.,2.5,3.79304,1.0,0.000,2.52381,5.63172,0.92857,0.000
Let me start by listing all the properties found in the data. From the entries provided, the properties include:,2.75,6.01226,0.875,0.067,1.5,2.50045,1.0,0.000
But the user's example includes Bot as a column, which is present in the Islamism entry.,2.0,4.82961,1.0,0.500,2.375,4.10211,1.0,0.000
But the user's example final answer has Bot and PersonFunction as columns. So, I need to include those.,1.83333,5.51466,1.0,0.231,2.5,3.43523,1.0,0.000
ns2:bot Bot and ns1:PersonFunction PersonFunction. So, those should be separate columns.,1.4,4.69839,0.75,0.000,2.0,3.43523,1.0,0.000
Therefore, the columns should be:,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,2.0,3.01273,1.0,0.000
For example, the Islamism entry has:,0.5,1.85566,1.0,0.000,2.0,3.01273,1.0,0.000
Now, I need to handle the wikiPageUsesTemplate which is a list of URLs. These should be separated by commas in the same column.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,3.86713,6.49101,0.95455,0.182
The Text column for Islamism has a long text block, which should be placed as is.,1.3,4.96484,0.9,0.400,2.0,3.79304,1.0,0.000
