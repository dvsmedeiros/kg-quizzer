Alright, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs based on the given information about the University of Chicago. Let me first understand what data is available.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,3.75,6.7216,0.96,0.042
Looking at the RDF data provided, there are several key points:,2.5,3.79304,1.0,0.167,2.0,3.43523,1.0,0.000
3. It uses certain Wikipedia templates like Template:Reflist, which might not be directly relevant for questions.,2.25,4.61384,1.0,0.000,3.33333,4.37319,1.0,0.000
- Depictions: Images, not relevant here.,1.5,1.85566,1.0,0.000,1.25,2.50045,1.0,0.000
Looking at the examples, they use specific numbers and facts from the data. So I should extract similar factual info.,1.5,3.01273,1.0,0.000,3.65,5.78178,1.0,0.062
5. How many students enrolled? Around 5,000.,0.86667,4.25402,0.85714,0.000,0.5,1.0,1.0,0.000
I think that's a solid approach. Now, let me formulate these into clear Q&A pairs in Portuguese.,0.83333,4.37319,1.0,0.143,3.23077,5.20226,1.0,0.000
