- If the object is a single literal or URI, create one row.,1.8,4.61384,1.0,0.444,1.25,2.50045,1.0,0.000
<subject> <predicate> object1, object2 .,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,0.5,1.0,1.0,0.000
Thus, the code can be structured as follows:,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,2.375,4.10211,1.0,0.000
3. For each triple, extract the predicate and object.,0.75,3.01273,1.0,0.000,2.5,3.43523,1.0,0.000
Now, putting this into code.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,1.6,3.01273,1.0,0.000
First, import necessary modules:,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,1.25,2.50045,1.0,0.000
from rdflib import URIRef, Namespace,1.5,3.01273,1.0,0.000,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000
Now, read the Turtle data:,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,2.0,3.01273,1.0,0.250
result = g.parse(data, format='turtle'),2.5,2.50045,1.0,0.333,1.83333,1.85566,1.0,0.000
Then, query all triples where the subject is http://dbpedia.org/resource/Construction.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,4.53846,4.61384,1.0,0.000
    object_type = 'URI' if isinstance(o, URIRef) else 'Literal',1.66667,3.43523,1.0,0.000,1.16667,2.50045,1.0,0.000
Now, testing with the given Turtle data:,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,3.0,3.79304,1.0,0.167
Now, implement this in Python.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,1.6,3.01273,1.0,0.000
But the user wants the code in a code block, and the CSV output as a text block.,4.5,5.12344,0.8,0.400,2.11111,4.37319,1.0,0.500
from rdflib import URIRef, Namespace,1.5,3.01273,1.0,0.000,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000
g.parse(data=data, format='turtle'),2.5,1.85566,1.0,0.000,1.83333,1.85566,1.0,0.000
    if isinstance(o, URIRef):,1.5,2.50045,1.0,0.000,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.000
    writer = csv.DictWriter(csvfile, fieldnames=fieldnames),1.85714,2.50045,1.0,0.000,1.5,1.0,1.0,0.000
Now, testing this code with the given Turtle data.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,3.33333,4.37319,1.0,0.125
The wikiPageUsesTemplate has two URIs, so two rows.,2.0,3.43523,1.0,0.000,1.25,2.50045,1.0,0.000
Thus, the code as written should produce the correct CSV.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,2.7,4.75438,0.88889,0.000
from rdflib import URIRef, Namespace,1.5,3.01273,1.0,0.000,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000
g.parse(data=data, format='turtle'),2.5,1.85566,1.0,0.000,1.83333,1.85566,1.0,0.000
    object_type = 'URI' if isinstance(o, URIRef) else 'Literal',1.66667,3.43523,1.0,0.000,1.16667,2.50045,1.0,0.000
    writer = csv.DictWriter(csvfile, fieldnames=fieldnames),1.85714,2.50045,1.0,0.000,1.5,1.0,1.0,0.000
