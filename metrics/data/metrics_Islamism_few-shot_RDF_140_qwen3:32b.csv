The main task is to extract all the properties (predicates) for each entity (subject) and list them in the CSV. Each unique combination of subject and predicate should be a row, with the subject as nome and the predicate as propriedade. ,4.88727,7.43343,0.83871,0.129,2.27273,5.12344,0.8,0.250
I should also verify if any of the properties are repeated for the same entity. For instance, ns2:date appears twice with different values. Each occurrence should be a separate row. ,2.90625,6.12437,0.88235,0.000,2.22222,5.51466,1.0,0.286
Now, let's process the data. I'll go through each line and extract the subject (nome) and predicate (propriedade). ,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,4.82857,6.32762,0.89474,0.211
Nome is the same, propriedade is affiliation.,1.5,3.01273,1.0,0.000,1.25,2.50045,1.0,0.333
Let me start writing out the CSV rows. For each line in the data, extract the subject (entity name) and predicate. For example:,2.69444,5.63172,0.92857,0.077,2.75,4.61384,1.0,0.000
nome,propriedade,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.000,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.000
For Islamism, the lines are:,0.5,1.85566,1.0,0.000,1.5,2.50045,1.0,0.000
nome,propriedade,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.000,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.000
