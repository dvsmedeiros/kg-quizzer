Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the given context and facts. Let me start by understanding the requirements.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,3.3125,6.64869,0.95833,0.000
8. How many students are enrolled? (Answer: 18,452),1.33333,4.37319,1.0,0.000,0.5,1.0,1.0,0.000
I need to ensure that the answers are directly from the context or facts. Also, avoid repetition. Let me structure each pair:,2.43333,5.76639,0.93333,0.000,1.41667,4.10211,1.0,0.000
But the user's example answer for a similar question is departamento de física de Chicago. So maybe the answer here is laboratório de metallurgia da universidade. However, the user's example might have a typo or different context. But I have to stick to the given context.,2.02778,7.28857,0.82143,0.174,3.51923,6.65876,0.8,0.053
Another point: the facts list has University of Chicago possui ranking USNWR mundial 15 and University of Chicago possui ranking USNWR numérico 6. So the answer for the USNWR numerical ranking is 6, and the worldwide ranking is 15. So two different questions could be: Qual é o ranking mundial da Universidade de Chicago no USNWR? (15) and Qual é o ranking numérico da Universidade de Chicago no USNWR? (6). That's two different questions.,3.04,8.16283,0.66667,0.030,2.30385,8.8763,0.61905,0.086
