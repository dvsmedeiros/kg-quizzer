Okay, I need to help the user generate 10 objective questions in Portuguese based on a given context about the University of Chicago. The context provided is just Universidade_de_Chicago without any details or subtopics. ,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,4.70652,7.35107,0.90909,0.121
Another idea could be about extracurricular activities or clubs. Maybe a question like,  qual da seguinte empresa est√° associada ao gradiente de engenharia da universidade de Chicago? That's direct and focused on the university.,2.275,5.36491,1.0,0.000,2.71667,6.58989,0.90909,0.250
I should avoid making the answers too obscure because they need to be directly related to the given context. Each answer must be clear and specific, so it's easy for the user to understand.,5.425,6.97361,0.88462,0.000,2.45455,4.61384,1.0,0.111
