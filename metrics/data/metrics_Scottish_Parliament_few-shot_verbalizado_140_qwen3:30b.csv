Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs in Portuguese based on the given context about the Scottish Parliament. Let me start by understanding the context thoroughly.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,4.18129,6.97361,0.88462,0.000
But I have to make sure not to use any facts that aren't in the context. The context mentions Edinburgh, Scotland as the location. So maybe include that as a question.,3.46053,6.61757,0.85714,0.048,1.95,5.1549,0.90909,0.364
I think this should meet the requirements. Now, format them into CSV.,1.75,4.37319,1.0,0.000,1.6,3.01273,1.0,0.000
Quais Ã¡reas o Parlamento pode legislar? Todas, exceto as reservadas.  ,0.92857,4.10211,1.0,0.250,1.25,2.50045,1.0,0.000
