Okay, so I need to come up with 10 question-answer pairs based on the provided data about construction. Let me go through this step by step.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,3.13889,6.7216,0.96,0.042
2. **Broader Category**: `ns2:hypernym` points to Process, indicating that construction is a type of process.,1.85,4.96484,0.9,0.000,2.11111,4.37319,1.0,0.000
6. **Market Size**: Questions about the size of the construction market, possibly using the data points provided.,2.11667,5.95935,0.69231,0.000,2.42857,3.79304,1.0,0.167
9. **Challenges in Construction**: Common issues faced in the industry, such as cost overruns or material shortages.,2.07143,5.47097,0.83333,0.000,2.375,4.10211,1.0,0.167
Wait, but I need to make sure each Q&A is clear and directly tied to the data provided. Let me refine these ideas into specific questions that can be answered using the given data points.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,5.10278,7.48266,0.91667,0.029
The `ns2:hypernym` is Process, which means construction falls under processes. So a question about whether construction is considered a process could be answered affirmatively.,2.0,3.43523,1.0,0.000,2.88095,6.42016,0.9,0.000
The close match descriptor might relate to how construction is categorized in other databases or taxonomies, so that could form another question.,7.5,5.78178,1.0,0.000,2.42857,3.79304,1.0,0.000
The templates used on the page don't directly provide info for Q&A but indicate how the information is structured, which might not be necessary unless the focus is on content organization.,3.13043,6.58989,0.90909,0.045,5.23077,5.20226,1.0,0.000
Thinking about all this, I can structure each question to target a specific property or value. Let me attempt to create 10 such pairs:,1.5,3.01273,1.0,0.000,2.68803,6.31501,0.95,0.222
Revisiting the data, perhaps 40.2 and 839.1 are significant figures. If 40.2 is a percentage (like 40.2% of GDP in some countries) and 839.1 might be in billions or another unit.,1.0,2.50045,1.0,0.333,3.63,7.33883,0.82759,0.154
   - Yes, construction is classified under the broader category of Process.,0.5,1.0,1.0,0.000,3.8,4.61384,1.0,0.000
   - Construction is closely matched with the ZBW descriptor 13173-4, indicating its relation to another vocabulary.,4.5,4.61384,1.0,0.000,2.42857,3.79304,1.0,0.000
   - Key economic figures include 40.2 and 839.1, which may represent percentages of GDP or market sizes in billions.,3.5,4.10211,1.0,0.000,4.75,5.02467,1.0,0.000
   - The global construction market is notably substantial, with significant contributions indicated by data points such as 839.1 (likely in billions).,1.875,4.10211,1.0,0.000,3.75,5.36491,1.0,0.091
   - The construction industry is notably active in regions with high infrastructure development and urbanization, such as Asia and North America.,4.8,5.51466,1.0,0.000,2.0,3.79304,1.0,0.000
