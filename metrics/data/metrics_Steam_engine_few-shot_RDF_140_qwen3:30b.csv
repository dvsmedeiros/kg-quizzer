Looking at the last part of the data, there's a line that has multiple objects separated by semicolons. For example:,3.5,4.51932,0.875,0.125,2.15385,5.36491,1.0,0.083
Similarly, the line with dcterms:subject and ns3:hypernym also has multiple objects. I'll need to handle those as well.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,2.95,6.21768,1.0,0.000
2. For lines with multiple objects (separated by commas), split them into individual rows.,2.5,4.61384,1.0,0.000,2.0,3.43523,1.0,0.200
Now, I'll go through the data step by step.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,3.54545,4.75438,0.88889,0.111
Another row with the same subject and predicate, different object.,3.5,4.37319,1.0,0.000,1.0,1.85566,1.0,0.000
Now, the line with multiple objects:,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,2.5,3.43523,1.0,0.000
Similarly, the line:,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,1.0,1.85566,1.0,0.000
Wait, the line is:,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,1.5,2.50045,1.0,0.000
