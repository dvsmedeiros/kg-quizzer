The data for Southern California includes ns2:populationAsOf '2020', but no actual population number. So the answer would be 2020 if the question is about the year. So a question could be In which year was the population of Southern California recorded? Answer: 2020.,1.91667,4.61384,1.0,0.111,3.90104,8.08786,0.71429,0.118

Wait, but the data mentions Southern California as the name. So maybe that's redundant. Let me check again.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,1.8619,6.11685,0.94444,0.118
