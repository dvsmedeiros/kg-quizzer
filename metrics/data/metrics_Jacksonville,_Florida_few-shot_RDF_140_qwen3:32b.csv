3. **Skip Duplicates**: If the same predicate appears multiple times for the same subject, only the first occurrence should be included.,2.11111,6.14642,0.8125,0.000,3.5,4.10211,1.0,0.000
- For each subject, collect all the predicates and their objects.,1.5,2.50045,1.0,0.000,2.875,4.10211,1.0,0.000
- Write each group into the CSV with the predicate and object, ensuring the namespaces are stripped.,5.5,5.1549,0.90909,0.000,2.5,3.43523,1.0,0.000

2. For each predicate in the group, remove the namespace (ns1 or ns2) to get the predicate name.,1.5,4.10211,1.0,0.000,6.5,5.1549,0.90909,0.000
Now, let's start processing the data.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,2.25,3.79304,1.0,0.333
First, list all the subjects and their triples.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,2.875,4.10211,1.0,0.000
Looking at the data provided, the subjects are:,2.0,3.43523,1.0,0.200,1.5,2.50045,1.0,0.000
