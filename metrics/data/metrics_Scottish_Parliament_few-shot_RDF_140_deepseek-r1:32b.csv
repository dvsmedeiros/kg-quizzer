Okay, so I need to help the user create a CSV file based on the data they provided and their instructions. Let me start by understanding what's given.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,3.7,6.92021,0.96429,0.077
First, I should parse through each line of the RDF data to extract relevant information. Each line typically follows a subject-predicate-object structure. My goal is to translate this into rows suitable for a CSV.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,3.53504,7.43379,0.87879,0.032
ns1:politicalGroups,Opposition,1.0,1.85566,1.0,0.000,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000
