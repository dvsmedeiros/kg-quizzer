Okay, let's tackle this. The user provided a bunch of RDF triples in Turtle format and wants a CSV file based on specific instructions. The main goal is to map the data correctly.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,3.8254,7.35107,0.90909,0.188
But how to get the person's name from their URI? The name is the label in the URI. For example, http://dbpedia.org/resource/Robert_Lucas_Jr. would have the name Robert Lucas Jr..,2.47436,6.86758,0.7619,0.048,2.55556,4.82961,1.0,0.000
- For each subject URI (person), extract the name by replacing underscores with spaces and removing the http://dbpedia.org/resource/ part.,3.5,3.43523,1.0,0.000,6.33333,5.63172,0.92857,0.000
Now, let's process the data.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,1.85714,3.43523,1.0,0.400
First, the university's own attributes:,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,1.57143,3.43523,1.0,0.200
Then, for each person:,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,1.25,2.50045,1.0,0.000
Looking through the data, there are multiple entries. For example:,1.5,3.01273,1.0,0.250,1.3,3.79304,1.0,0.000
For each line that starts with a person's URI followed by a predicate and the university URI, create a row.,2.05263,6.22924,0.88889,0.278,1.25,2.50045,1.0,0.000
Now, the challenge is to parse all these lines and extract the necessary information.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,6.5,5.48607,0.92308,0.000
Another thing to note is that the university's URI is the same for all, so any triple where the object is that URI is a relation to the university.,3.875,5.89204,0.86667,0.067,4.25,5.89204,0.86667,0.267
Now, the user's data has the university's own attributes. Let's check the last line:,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,2.77885,6.29661,0.75,0.125
Now, compiling all these into the CSV.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,2.42857,3.79304,1.0,0.000
I think that's the plan. Now, proceed to generate the CSV.,0.875,4.10211,1.0,0.143,2.0,3.43523,1.0,0.000
