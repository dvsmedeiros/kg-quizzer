Okay, so I need to figure out how to create the 10 pairs of questions and answers based on the given RDF data about Islamism. Let me start by understanding what's in that data.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,4.29167,7.39662,0.91176,0.062
Wait, some of these might be repeating entities or not exactly as per the data. It's crucial to ensure each question refers uniquely and accurately to an entity in the RDF.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,5.42281,7.17187,0.93548,0.065
I think this covers the main groups mentioned, each with a clear yes/no answer based on their connection to Islamism through the RDF data.,3.5,4.37319,1.0,0.000,5.70588,5.78178,1.0,0.067
