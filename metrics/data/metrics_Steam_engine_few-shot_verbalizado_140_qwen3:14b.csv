Let me make sure each answer is directly from the context or the facts. For example, the first question about external combustion is in the context. The Rankine cycle is also there. Thomas Savery's invention is in the context. Thomas Newcomen's engine in 1712. James Watt's improvement. The replacement by electric motors and internal combustion engines in the early 20th century. The main working fluid is steam. Steam pressure pushing the piston. Jerónimo de Ayanz y Beaumont's invention in 1606. The first commercially successful engine by Newcomen in 1712.,2.68333,5.89142,0.9375,0.000,2.69023,9.90782,0.62338,0.027
Wait, some answers might be duplicates. Let me check again. The first question is about the type of engine. The second is the cycle. Third is Newcomen's invention. Fourth is Watt's improvement. Fifth is replacement. Sixth is steam pressure's role. Seventh is Ayanz's invention. Eighth is steam as the working fluid. Ninth might be redundant with seventh. Maybe need to rephrase some.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,1.99048,9.27641,0.69231,0.016
But the context mentions that steam engines were used in ships, but the main use is as heat engines. Hmm.,5.0,5.02467,1.0,0.000,1.41667,4.61384,1.0,0.000
I think the initial list is okay, as long as they are unique and based on the context. Let me finalize the 10 questions and answers.,3.0,4.10211,1.0,0.000,2.86111,6.44608,0.84211,0.000
