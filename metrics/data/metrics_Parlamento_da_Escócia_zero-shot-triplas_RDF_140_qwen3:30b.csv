Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs based on the provided DBpedia data about the Scottish Parliament. Let me start by understanding the data structure and the key information present.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,4.74206,7.2924,0.86667,0.034
Now, I need to create 10 pairs. Let me brainstorm possible questions:,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,1.91667,5.02467,1.0,0.000
Now, check each answer against the data:,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,3.0,3.79304,1.0,0.167
2. Location: Scottish Parliament Building and Edinburgh, Scotland,0.96429,4.10211,1.0,0.000,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000
10. Meeting place: Scottish Parliament Building and Edinburgh, Scotland,1.25,4.37319,1.0,0.000,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000
Now, check the answers again for each:,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,2.42857,3.79304,1.0,0.000
1. Scottish Parliament (but in Portuguese, it's Parlamento Escocês),1.5,3.79304,1.0,0.000,1.33333,3.01273,1.0,0.250
9. --05-07 → 07 de maio (but the data might have a placeholder, so the answer is as per the data),1.64286,5.36491,1.0,0.200,1.55556,4.51932,0.875,0.143
I think that's covered. Now, compiling the 10 pairs.,0.78571,3.79304,1.0,0.167,1.6,3.01273,1.0,0.000
