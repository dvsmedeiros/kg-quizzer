Wait, maybe the user made a mistake in pasting the data. Let me check again. The first line is:,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,2.04848,6.22924,0.88889,0.062
So the first step is to parse each line into three columns. Each line is a triple separated by spaces. For example, the first line would be:,2.87037,6.69635,0.86364,0.182,2.5,3.43523,1.0,0.000
But that seems like the same resource is being referenced twice. Maybe that's a mistake, but I have to go with the data provided. ,2.70833,5.89142,0.9375,0.067,4.5,4.61384,1.0,0.111
I need to make sure that the CSV is properly formatted with commas and quotes if necessary. Since the URLs contain slashes, they might need to be enclosed in quotes to prevent issues with commas in the data. ,5.25,6.49101,0.95455,0.000,4.82353,6.01226,0.875,0.062
Wait, looking at the last line:,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,2.5,3.43523,1.0,0.000
In any case, the main task is to split each line into three columns. ,1.0,2.50045,1.0,0.000,5.5,5.02467,1.0,0.000
So the final CSV would have three columns, each line representing a triple. ,3.5,4.37319,1.0,0.250,1.66667,3.43523,1.0,0.000
I'll proceed to generate that CSV, ensuring that each line is correctly split and that the fields are properly quoted if necessary.,2.125,4.10211,1.0,0.000,7.17647,5.89142,0.9375,0.000
**Nota:** O conteúdo acima é uma representação simplificada do CSV. O dado original apresentado contém repetição e possíveis erros de formatação (como URLs duplicadas e predicados inconsistentes). Para um CSV válido, seria necessário validar e corrigir os dados antes da exportação.,1.74167,7.43379,0.87879,0.304,1.90909,4.82961,1.0,0.500
