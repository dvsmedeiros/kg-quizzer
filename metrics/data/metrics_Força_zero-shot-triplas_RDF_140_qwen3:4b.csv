First, I'll list out the key points from the data:,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,4.0,4.96484,0.9,0.100
2. The Force node uses several templates, including Units_of_force.,1.5,4.10211,1.0,0.000,1.0,1.85566,1.0,0.000
I need to make sure each answer is a direct fact from the data. For example, the answer for the question about other units is Kip and Poundal. The answer for the question about the categories is the three listed.,2.05,5.78178,1.0,0.312,4.0,7.81565,0.58333,0.000
I think that's all. Now, structure the 10 pairs accordingly.,0.78571,3.79304,1.0,0.167,1.66667,3.43523,1.0,0.000
   **Resposta:** Categoria:Force, Categoria:Natural_philosophy e Categoria:Temporal_rates.  ,2.22222,3.59796,0.8,0.000,2.625,3.59796,0.8,0.000
   **Resposta:** Kip e Poundal são as únicas unidades listadas, mas outras como Traction e Peierls_stress são mencionadas como relacionadas.  ,2.21429,5.1549,0.90909,0.111,2.09091,4.96484,0.9,0.200
