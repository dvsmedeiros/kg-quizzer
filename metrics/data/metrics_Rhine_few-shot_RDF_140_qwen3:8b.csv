Okay, I need to generate a CSV based on the user's instructions and rules. Let me start by understanding the requirements.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,2.1875,6.40552,0.95238,0.053
I'll need to map each of these entities into the CSV structure. For example, the Rhine River would have:,2.95,5.65316,1.0,0.000,2.5,3.43523,1.0,0.000
- Imagem: The Rhine in Basel, Switzerland,1.71429,3.43523,1.0,0.000,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000
- Nome: Ponte do Reno, Kehl,1.5,3.01273,1.0,0.250,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000
- Imagem: (if available, the image caption from the data),1.5,2.50045,1.0,0.000,3.0,3.95066,0.83333,0.167
Each entry should have a unique ID. Since the user didn't specify the ID format, I'll use numbers starting from 1. ,2.05,6.01226,0.875,0.312,2.66667,4.10211,1.0,0.000
Now, I need to structure this into a CSV with the correct headers and entries. I'll make sure to use Portuguese for the headers and fill in the data accurately based on the provided information.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,4.47246,7.78065,0.8,0.029
- A tabela inclui principais elementos do rio Reno e seus tributários, pontes e características.  ,1.58333,5.02467,1.0,0.286,1.25,2.50045,1.0,0.000
