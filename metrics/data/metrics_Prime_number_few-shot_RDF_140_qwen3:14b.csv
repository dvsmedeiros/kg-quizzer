Now, I need to create questions that cover these topics without repeating. Each question should have a unique answer derived from the context or facts. Let me brainstorm possible questions:,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,3.61111,6.98051,0.96552,0.143
But I need to ensure no repetition. The user's example had a question about the largest prime as of January 2016, but the context here is December 2018. So that's a good point to include.,2.65625,6.49101,0.95455,0.050,2.7,5.65316,1.0,0.071
Let me check for any possible repetition or missing points. I think the list above covers the main points. Now, I'll format them accordingly.,2.40909,6.42016,0.9,0.000,1.85714,3.43523,1.0,0.000
