Okay, so I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs based on the provided data about steam engines and related topics. Let me start by understanding what's given here.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,3.95227,6.84058,1.0,0.074
3. In which year was James Watt's改良式蒸汽机改进完成？(Assuming this is about the year, but I need to check historical data. Maybe 1776?),2.0625,5.63172,0.92857,0.000,2.5,4.61384,1.0,0.111
8. What was the name of the first practical steam-powered vehicle? (Answer: Cugnot's fardier à vapeur, but maybe not in the data provided),2.14646,6.00792,0.94118,0.062,3.5,4.10211,1.0,0.143
Wait, some of these might not be directly covered in the data provided. Let me cross-check.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,2.31731,5.65316,1.0,0.071
2. Who was the key figure in improving the efficiency of early steam engines? (Answer: James Watt, but I need to check if he's mentioned here),2.8,6.00792,0.94118,0.000,2.91667,4.82961,1.0,0.100
10. Who invented the steam-powered vehicle called the Fardier à vapeur? (Answer: Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot, but not sure if this is covered),2.05758,5.63172,0.92857,0.000,3.5,4.10211,1.0,0.000
Wait, some of these might be too specific or not directly from the data. Let me make sure I'm using information present.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,4.34091,6.39884,1.0,0.095
Hmm, that seems repetitive because some answers are similar. Maybe I should vary the questions to cover different aspects.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,4.16667,6.01374,1.0,0.000
Wait, I'm not sure about that last answer. Maybe it's better to stick with what's in the data.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,2.81667,6.31501,0.95,0.150
I think I have enough to create 10 questions now, ensuring each has an accurate answer based on the provided data.,2.4,4.96484,0.9,0.000,4.75,5.02467,1.0,0.091
