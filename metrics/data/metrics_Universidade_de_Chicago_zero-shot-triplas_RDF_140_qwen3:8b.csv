Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs based on the provided data about the University of Chicago. Let me start by understanding the data structure.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,3.97222,6.90937,0.88,0.042
Wait, the instruction says the question should be about the relationship between the person and the University. So each question should be structured as Quem é [X] da Universidade de Chicago? or Qual é [X] da Universidade de Chicago? depending on the predicate.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,3.72594,8.76781,0.65909,0.024
Looking at the examples from the user's previous response, they used Quem é o aluno da Universidade de Chicago? with the answer David Friedman. So I need to follow that structure.,2.90909,4.96484,0.9,0.100,2.60606,6.39884,1.0,0.105
2. David Friedman,almaMater,0.5,2.50045,1.0,0.000,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000
Now, I need to create questions for each of these. Let me start with the first one:,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,2.65,5.78178,1.0,0.000
Wait, maybe the structure is: Quem é [X] da Universidade de Chicago? where X is the predicate. For example:,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,2.02222,6.44608,0.84211,0.059
- For employer: Quem é o empregador da Universidade de Chicago? but that's not correct. The University is the employer, so the person is the employee. So the question should be Quem trabalha na Universidade de Chicago? or Quem é empregada pela Universidade de Chicago? (Margaret Hayes Grazier). So the question would be Quem é empregada pela Universidade de Chicago? and the answer is Margaret Hayes Grazier.,2.11355,6.42016,0.9,0.111,2.59615,9.76682,0.51064,0.023
Wait, maybe the user wants the question to be in the form of Quem é [X] da Universidade de Chicago? where X is the predicate term. For example:,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,2.29437,7.18797,0.85714,0.037
But some of these might not be standard. Alternatively, the user might prefer to use the predicate as the question part. For example:,1.66667,4.61384,1.0,0.000,2.23077,5.76263,0.85714,0.000
For employer: Quem é empregada pela Universidade de Chicago? (since the University is the employer, and Margaret Hayes Grazier is the employee).,2.72727,5.89204,0.86667,0.071,4.0,4.10211,1.0,0.000
But I need to follow the user's examples. Looking back, the user's example for David Friedman,1.75,5.02467,1.0,0.091,1.5,4.10211,1.0,0.143
For Samuel Wendell Williston,workInstitution,1.5,3.01273,1.0,0.000,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000
For Ronald Coase,institution,1.0,2.50045,1.0,0.000,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000
For Yoichiro Nambu,workInstitution,1.0,2.50045,1.0,0.000,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000
For Steven Wilf,award,1.0,2.50045,1.0,0.000,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000
Now, I need to make sure that each question is unique and covers different predicates. Let me list the 10:,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,2.81667,6.11885,1.0,0.000
2. Rose Friedman,almaMater,0.5,2.50045,1.0,0.000,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000
Wait, maybe I should pick different people for each predicate. Let me check the data again.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,2.67143,5.65316,1.0,0.071
2. Rose Friedman,almaMater,0.5,2.50045,1.0,0.000,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000
2. Quem é o aluno da Universidade de Chicago? → Rose Friedman (but same question, so need to change),1.83333,5.51466,1.0,0.182,2.0,3.01273,1.0,0.000
Wait, this is conflicting. Maybe I can use different questions for the same predicate but different people. For example:,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,1.94048,6.22924,0.88889,0.000
2. Quem é o aluno da Universidade de Chicago? → Rose Friedman (same question, not good),1.66667,5.36491,1.0,0.200,1.0,1.85566,1.0,0.000
Alternative approach: For each predicate, use different questions. For example:,1.5,3.43523,1.0,0.000,1.125,3.43523,1.0,0.000
- For employer: Quem é o empregador da Universidade de Chicago? (but the University is the employer, so the person is the employee),2.88462,6.01226,0.875,0.071,3.0,3.95066,0.83333,0.000
Wait, this is confusing. Let me try to structure the 10 questions:,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,1.84722,5.02467,1.0,0.000
2. Quem é o aluno da Universidade de Chicago? → Rose Friedman (same question, not good),1.66667,5.36491,1.0,0.200,1.0,1.85566,1.0,0.000
5. Quem trabalha na Universidade de Chicago? → Yoichiro N, Nambu,1.07143,4.61384,1.0,0.143,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000
But this has repeated questions for almaMater and workInstitution. To avoid repetition, I can adjust:,1.9,5.20226,1.0,0.000,1.5,2.50045,1.0,0.000
Aqui estão 10 perguntas e respostas com base nos dados fornecidos, organizadas de forma a evitar repetição e manter a clareza:,1.63636,5.02467,1.0,0.143,2.36364,4.96484,0.9,0.833
- **Perguntas únicas** foram criadas para evitar repetição, mesmo para o mesmo predicado (como alma mater).,2.66667,4.75438,0.88889,0.250,2.27273,4.51932,0.875,1.000
- **Respostas específicas** foram atribuídas a cada pergunta, garantindo que cada pessoa seja mencionada apenas uma vez por pergunta.,1.75,4.75438,0.88889,0.143,1.91667,5.02467,1.0,0.571
