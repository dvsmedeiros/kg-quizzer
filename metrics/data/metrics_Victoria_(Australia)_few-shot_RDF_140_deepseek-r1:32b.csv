Since the user wants the CSV generated now based on previous instructions, perhaps they expect all entities that are either located in Victoria or have some significant association with it. So my approach would be:,2.91667,5.32781,0.91667,0.000,5.07895,6.48214,1.0,0.000
I should also check for any inconsistencies or duplicates in the data. For example, some places might be listed under different predicates but refer to the same entity.,1.94231,5.63172,0.92857,0.071,6.2,5.51466,1.0,0.000
In summary, my plan is:,0.5,1.85566,1.0,0.000,1.25,2.50045,1.0,0.000
I think that's a reasonable approach given the information at hand. I'll proceed to structure the CSV accordingly, making sure to include all entities with their respective details as per the extracted data.,2.70635,6.42016,0.9,0.053,4.25,5.65316,1.0,0.067
