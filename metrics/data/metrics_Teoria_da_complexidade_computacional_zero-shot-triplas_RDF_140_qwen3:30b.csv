The challenge is to create questions and answers that are relevant to the context and facts, without repeating similar questions. Each question should have a single correct answer that's either explicit or inferable from the content.,7.5,6.14642,0.8125,0.000,2.3,6.31084,1.0,0.238
First, I'll list possible aspects to cover:,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,2.66667,4.10211,1.0,0.000
Now, I'll draft questions based on these aspects.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,3.1,4.37319,1.0,0.000
3. What is a computational problem? (Answer: A task solved by a computer, often through algorithms.),1.14815,5.62279,0.84615,0.333,2.0,2.50045,1.0,0.000
6. What are some categories associated with computational complexity theory? (Answer: Category:Computational_complexity_theory, Category:Computational_fields_of_study.),2.04444,5.36491,1.0,0.000,1.6,1.85566,1.0,0.000
4. Pergunta: Quais são os recursos principais considerados na teoria da complexidade? Resposta: Tempo, espaço e outros recursos computacionais.,1.26923,5.51466,1.0,0.200,1.5,3.43523,1.0,0.333
   Resposta: Tempo, espaço e outros recursos computacionais.  ,1.0,1.85566,1.0,0.000,1.5,3.43523,1.0,0.333
