I need to make sure that each triple from the data is represented in the CSV. For example, the first triple is:,2.86765,6.11685,0.94444,0.056,2.0,3.01273,1.0,0.000
Then, the main resource Victoria_(Australia) has multiple predicates. For instance:,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,3.25,4.82961,1.0,0.000
I need to make sure that all these are included. Also, predicates like wikiPageUsesTemplate and foaf:depiction should have their respective URIs as values.,2.5,5.02467,1.0,0.000,3.86667,5.36491,1.0,0.000
Now, compiling all these into CSV format.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,2.42857,3.79304,1.0,0.000
