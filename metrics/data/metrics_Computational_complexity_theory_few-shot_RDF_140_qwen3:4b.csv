Now, I need to create varied questions that cover these areas without repetition. Let's start with the main classification. The first question could be about the main focus of computational complexity theory. The answer would be classifying problems by resource usage.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,4.91667,7.81387,0.87805,0.024
Another point is the role of computational complexity theory in determining practical limits. Then, the two fields closely related to computational complexity: analysis of algorithms and computability theory. ,2.85714,5.51466,1.0,0.000,4.6875,5.51466,1.0,0.000
A question about the key distinction between analysis of algorithms and computational complexity theory. Also, the field that analyzes resources of a specific algorithm. ,3.1,5.65316,1.0,0.000,4.5,4.61384,1.0,0.444
Finally, the P vs NP problem is part of computational complexity theory. ,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,5.5,5.02467,1.0,0.000
Answer: analysis focuses on specific algorithms, while complexity focuses on problem classification.,1.42857,3.79304,1.0,0.000,2.0,3.79304,1.0,0.000
Then, the ninth question could be about the field that analyzes the resources of a specific algorithm. ,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,5.11765,6.01226,0.875,0.250
Finally, the tenth question about the P vs NP problem. ,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,4.5,4.75438,0.88889,0.000
