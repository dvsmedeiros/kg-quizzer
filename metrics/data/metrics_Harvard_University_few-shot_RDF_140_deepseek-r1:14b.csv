Okay, so I need to generate a CSV based on the given RDF data about Harvard University and its alumni. Let me think through how to approach this.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,3.94722,6.85711,0.96296,0.040
- Você é um... is just a greeting, not relevant.,1.22222,4.10211,1.0,0.000,1.0,1.85566,1.0,0.000
- The block about Harvard University sets its type and sports affiliations, but that's not needed for the CSV.,5.5,5.02467,1.0,0.000,2.1,4.37319,1.0,0.125
Wait, the example provided in the initial answer had Cargo as Alumni. So perhaps that's a standard for those without specific roles listed.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,3.43452,6.57194,0.95652,0.045
- The CSV should handle special characters in names properly, possibly using UTF-8 encoding.,4.5,4.61384,1.0,0.000,1.6,3.01273,1.0,0.000
I think I'm ready to structure this CSV now, making sure each column is correctly labeled and filled with the extracted data.,2.54545,4.96484,0.9,0.100,5.71429,5.36491,1.0,0.077
