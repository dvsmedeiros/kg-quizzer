Okay, I need to help create 10 question-answer pairs in Portuguese based on the provided context about ctenophores. Let me start by carefully reading through the context to identify key points that can be turned into relevant questions.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,6.14286,7.52335,0.91892,0.000
First, I notice that ctenophores are known as comb jellies and are marine invertebrates. They use cilia for swimming. That's a good fact for a question about their mode of movement.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,2.64921,7.34143,0.87097,0.034
Next, the text mentions that adult sizes range from millimeters to 1.5 meters. This can be used to ask about typical size ranges.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,5.13636,6.49101,0.95455,0.000
There's a mention of fossils dating back to the early Cambrian, about 525 million years ago. This fact can form a question about fossil evidence or historical presence.,3.15385,5.20226,1.0,0.091,2.57692,6.00792,0.94118,0.000
The position of ctenophores in the evolutionary tree is debated, with some theories suggesting they are sister to sponges (Porifera Sister Hypothesis) and others that sponges appeared earlier (Ctenophora Sister Hypothesis). This can be turned into a question about their phylogenetic relationships.,4.5,4.96484,0.9,0.000,5.02885,7.38853,0.875,0.129
I should ensure each question is relevant and the answers are concise, up to 10 words. Let me list out possible questions based on these points:,5.5,5.20226,1.0,0.000,2.66364,5.51466,1.0,0.000
Now, I'll craft each question and ensure the answers are accurate based on the context.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,5.64706,5.76639,0.93333,0.000
Resposta: De alguns milímetros a 1,5 metros.,1.57143,3.79304,1.0,0.000,1.0,1.85566,1.0,0.000
5.Mais que outros, os ctênoforos são predadores ou parasitas?  ,0.8,2.50045,1.0,0.000,1.71429,3.79304,1.0,0.250
Resposta: Predadores, com exceção de jovens de duas espécies.,1.0,1.85566,1.0,0.000,1.625,4.25402,0.85714,0.333
Resposta: Há 525 milhões de anos, no Cambriano inicial.,1.14286,3.79304,1.0,0.000,1.25,2.50045,1.0,0.500
