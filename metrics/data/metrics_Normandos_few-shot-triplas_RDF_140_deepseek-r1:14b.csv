Alright, so I need to generate 10 true/false questions based on the provided context about Normans. Let me start by reading through the context and facts carefully.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,3.76042,6.87947,0.92308,0.000
3. Language: They spoke Old Norman, which was related to French.,1.0,3.79304,1.0,0.000,2.0,3.43523,1.0,0.000
Now, I'll structure each question and its answer:,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,3.1,4.37319,1.0,0.000
4. **Religion**: Were they Christian by 1000 AD? (Yes, as per context),1.4359,5.1549,0.90909,0.000,1.0,2.50045,1.0,0.000
Alternatively, perhaps some can be phrased as true/false but include specific elements. For example:,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,1.875,5.36491,1.0,0.000
6. They spoke Old Norman, which is a Romance language.,1.0,3.43523,1.0,0.000,1.5,3.43523,1.0,0.000
Wait, perhaps some points are better suited as true/false rather than direct statements. Let me make sure they're accurate based on the context:,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,2.92308,6.48214,1.0,0.000
Using these, I can create questions like:,0.5,1.85566,1.0,0.000,2.5,3.43523,1.0,0.000
Wait, the context mentions that Normans were originally pagans but converted. So a question could be about their religion before conversion.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,4.31818,6.21768,1.0,0.200
Alternatively, perhaps focusing on specific facts:,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,2.0,3.43523,1.0,0.000
I think it's better to structure each question to test specific knowledge points, ensuring they're accurate and vary in content to cover different aspects of Normans.,4.13333,5.63172,0.92857,0.071,5.1875,5.51466,1.0,0.000
6. **The Normans spoke Old Norman, which is a Romance language.**  ,1.75,4.10211,1.0,0.000,1.0,3.79304,1.0,0.000
