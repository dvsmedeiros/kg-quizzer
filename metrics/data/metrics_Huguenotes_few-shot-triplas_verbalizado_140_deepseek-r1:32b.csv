Okay, so I need to create 10 question-answer pairs based on the given context and facts about Huguenots. Let me start by understanding what's provided.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,3.53333,6.63618,1.0,0.042
Now, I need to create varied questions that cover different aspects without repetition. Each question should have one correct answer from the context or facts.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,5.61538,6.56113,1.0,0.000
Wait, some of these might be overlapping. Let me check:,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,2.25,4.61384,1.0,0.000
I should ensure each question targets a unique aspect. Also, making sure answers are specific as per the context.,1.35,4.82961,1.0,0.400,2.4,4.61384,1.0,0.000
Hmm, perhaps rephrase that.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,1.25,2.50045,1.0,0.000
Wait, some might still be too similar.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,2.42857,3.79304,1.0,0.000
   Approximately 300,000.,0.5,1.85566,1.0,0.000,0.5,1.0,1.0,0.000
   Orange County, New York and Staten Island.,0.5,1.85566,1.0,0.000,2.5,3.43523,1.0,0.000
   About 300,000.,0.5,1.85566,1.0,0.000,0.5,1.0,1.0,0.000
Each question is crafted to target a unique aspect of the Huguenots' history and circumstances, ensuring variety and comprehensive coverage of the provided context.,2.3125,5.65316,1.0,0.267,4.5,4.61384,1.0,0.000
