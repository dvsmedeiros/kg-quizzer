But in the data, the first entry is:,1.5,3.01273,1.0,0.250,2.0,3.01273,1.0,0.000
Then, foaf:depiction has two objects (two URLs).,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,3.18182,4.25402,0.85714,0.000
Additionally, there's another line:,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,1.5,3.01273,1.0,0.250
Therefore, the CSV should have the following rows:,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,3.5,4.25402,0.85714,0.000
Therefore, the CSV should have these 9 entries.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,2.375,4.10211,1.0,0.000
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Force> ns1:hypernym, http://dbpedia.org/resource/Force,2.66667,3.01273,1.0,0.000,1.2,1.85566,1.0,0.000
Then, the data starts with:,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,2.0,3.01273,1.0,0.250
Then, the next lines are the ones with the wikiPageUsesTemplate and foaf:depiction.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,6.5,5.47097,0.83333,0.000
Then, the last line is the Newton subject with ns2:quantity and object Force.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,5.0,5.48607,0.92308,0.000
Then, the next line is:,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,2.0,3.01273,1.0,0.000
Then, the line with ns2:wikiPageUsesTemplate has five objects.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,3.0,4.37319,1.0,0.000
Then, the foaf:depiction has two objects.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,2.375,3.79304,1.0,0.000
Then, the last line is the Newton with ns2:quantity.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,5.0,4.75438,0.88889,0.000
Therefore, the CSV should have 10 rows.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,2.0,3.79304,1.0,0.000
Therefore, the answer is a CSV with these 10 rows.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,2.3,4.61384,1.0,0.000
