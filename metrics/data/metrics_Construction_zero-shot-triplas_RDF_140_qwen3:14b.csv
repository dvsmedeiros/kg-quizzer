In the user's data, the companies are listed with their properties. For example:,1.33333,3.43523,1.0,0.400,2.25,4.61384,1.0,0.000
So these are the companies listed in the user's data. Therefore, the Q&A pairs should be based on these companies and their relationships to the construction industry.,1.92308,5.32781,0.91667,0.167,4.42105,6.11685,0.94444,0.000
Now, the user's example answer includes questions like:,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,2.6,4.37319,1.0,0.125
So the list is longer. Therefore, the answer to the question Quais são as empresas que fazem parte da indústria da construção? should include all these companies.,1.25,3.79304,1.0,0.000,2.52941,6.50743,0.90476,0.250
But the user's example focuses on companies, so perhaps the majority of the questions should be about companies in the construction industry.,1.88889,4.37319,1.0,0.125,4.4375,5.89204,0.86667,0.000
Another approach is to ask about specific data points, such as:,4.0,4.61384,1.0,0.111,1.0,1.85566,1.0,0.000
But the user's example focuses on companies, so perhaps the majority should be on companies.,1.88889,4.37319,1.0,0.125,3.33333,4.37319,1.0,0.000
