Looking back, the initial example given by the user is:,0.5,1.85566,1.0,0.000,4.0,4.51932,0.875,0.000
The user provided a list of RDF triples, each in the form:,1.375,4.37319,1.0,0.500,2.0,3.01273,1.0,0.000
But that's not matching the data. Alternatively, maybe the Label is the value of the property. But that would be inconsistent.,1.11111,4.37319,1.0,0.250,3.25,5.76263,0.85714,0.000
