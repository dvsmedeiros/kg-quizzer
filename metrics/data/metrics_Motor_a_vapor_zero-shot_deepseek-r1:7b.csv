Okay, I need to generate 10 pairs of questions and answers based on the context provided about a steam motor. The user wants these in CSV format with specific separators and language.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,4.625,7.17187,0.93548,0.161
Now, I'll formulate each question and its answer based on these topics.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,4.92857,5.20226,1.0,0.000
Okay, let's structure them:,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,1.5,3.01273,1.0,0.250
That should cover 10 unique aspects with clear, correct answers based on the Steam Motor context.,1.375,4.37319,1.0,0.000,3.33333,4.37319,1.0,0.000
