2. For each predicate, determine the namespace (ns1 or ns2).,0.75,3.01273,1.0,0.000,4.0,3.79304,1.0,0.000
But in the input, the first line is:,1.5,3.01273,1.0,0.000,2.0,3.01273,1.0,0.000
Wait, the user's input has two lines with ns2:quantity and ns2:unit. Let me check again.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,2.77059,6.00792,0.94118,0.067
Therefore, for each line:,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,1.25,2.50045,1.0,0.000
- If the predicate is ns1:hypernym, data_type is hypernym.,3.5,3.79304,1.0,0.000,1.25,2.50045,1.0,0.000
- If the predicate is ns2:quantity, data_type is quantity.,3.5,3.79304,1.0,0.000,1.25,2.50045,1.0,0.000
- If the predicate is ns2:unit, data_type is unit.,3.5,3.79304,1.0,0.000,1.25,2.50045,1.0,0.000
Now, the user's input has several lines. Let's go through them one by one.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,2.66111,5.89204,0.86667,0.067
Next, the other lines in the input are all ns1:hypernym. For example:,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,2.54167,5.32781,0.91667,0.000
3. If it is, add to the CSV with the corresponding data_type.,0.75,3.01273,1.0,0.000,3.33333,4.51932,0.875,0.000
- Split the line into triples, each separated by semicolons.,2.5,3.43523,1.0,0.000,1.6,3.01273,1.0,0.000
- If yes, add to CSV with the corresponding data_type.,1.0,1.85566,1.0,0.000,2.875,4.10211,1.0,0.000
But the user's example in the CSV only includes the first part of that line (the ns2:unit), and ignores the others.,6.6087,6.44608,0.84211,0.053,2.0,3.01273,1.0,0.000
      iii. If the predicate is one of the allowed ones, add to the CSV.,2.25,4.96484,0.9,0.000,1.6,3.01273,1.0,0.000
Now, the actual parsing of the triples. Each triple is in the form <subject> <predicate> <object> ,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,2.32143,5.47097,0.83333,0.000
Then, the other triples in the same line (ns2:wikiPageUsesTemplate and foaf:depiction) are not included.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,5.05,5.76639,0.93333,0.000
Now, the rest of the lines in the input are all ns1:hypernym. For example:,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,2.75,5.76263,0.85714,0.000
