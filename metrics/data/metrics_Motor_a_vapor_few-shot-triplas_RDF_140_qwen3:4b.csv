Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to generate 10 question-answer pairs based on the provided information. Let me look through the data given to see what's relevant.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,2.76349,7.48759,0.8,0.103
I need to make sure the questions are based on these facts. Let me check each part of the data again. The user's examples use the same structure, so I need to follow that. The key is to use the information from the data and the examples to form new questions.,3.00883,7.1494,0.89655,0.071,5.75,7.00198,0.78261,0.043
- The pressure in the Rankine cycle is not directly mentioned, but maybe the answer is high pressure.,5.0,4.96484,0.9,0.000,2.875,4.10211,1.0,0.000
So for the 10 questions, I need to use these points. Let me try to create 10 unique questions based on that.,1.0,3.43523,1.0,0.000,2.875,6.00792,0.94118,0.000
