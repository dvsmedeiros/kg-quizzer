Okay, so I need to come up with 10 questions and answers related to prime numbers based on the given information. Let me start by understanding what the user provided.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,4.07857,7.06263,0.93103,0.000
3. Can even numbers be prime? (Yes, only 2),1.0,4.10211,1.0,0.000,1.0,1.85566,1.0,0.000
Wait, the data mentions that Scherk and Noll are known for prime numbers. So maybe question 10 could be about them.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,3.38034,6.21768,1.0,0.050
2. Is 2 considered a prime number? - Yes, 2 is the smallest and only even prime number.,0.90476,4.51932,0.875,0.500,4.5,4.61384,1.0,0.000
7. Is 1 considered a prime number? - No, because it only has one divisor.,0.90476,4.37319,1.0,0.571,3.0,3.79304,1.0,0.000
9. Can composite numbers be prime? - No, composites have factors other than 1 and themselves.,1.0,4.10211,1.0,0.000,3.33333,4.37319,1.0,0.000
