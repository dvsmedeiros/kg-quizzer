Okay, I need to generate 10 question and answer pairs based on the provided context about Southern California. Let's start by understanding what information is available.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,4.30051,6.70759,1.0,0.038
The population figure given is for 2019, so a question about that makes sense.,2.28571,4.10211,1.0,0.000,2.375,4.10211,1.0,0.000
Looking at the list of facts, organizations like CIF Southern Section and California Avocado Society are based there. That leads to a question about what organization is headquartered in the region.,2.5,3.79304,1.0,0.000,4.54396,6.63618,1.0,0.160
The context mentions earthquakes affecting Southern California, such as the 2014 La Habra earthquake. A question about a significant event makes sense.,3.0,4.10211,1.0,0.000,2.24306,5.76639,0.93333,0.000
The region includes major cities, so asking which large city is part of it could be answered with Los Angeles.,2.0,3.43523,1.0,0.200,5.9375,5.65316,1.0,0.000
There are several museums listed, so a question about a museum based there would fit well.,2.0,3.43523,1.0,0.000,2.83333,5.1549,0.90909,0.400
Mexican-Americans and other ethnic groups have populations in Southern California, so asking about the largest group by ethnicity is relevant.,4.5,4.82961,1.0,0.000,4.27273,4.82961,1.0,0.000
These pairs cover various aspects of Southern California, ensuring a broad understanding of the region.,3.5,4.37319,1.0,0.000,2.375,4.10211,1.0,0.000
