2. For each URI, list the values of each property.,0.75,3.01273,1.0,0.000,3.0,3.79304,1.0,0.000
Each of these properties may have multiple values, so I need to join them with a delimiter like semicolon or comma.,3.5,4.37319,1.0,0.000,3.28571,5.36491,1.0,0.000
Now, looking at the data:,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,2.0,3.01273,1.0,0.250
- The first entry is `<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Islamism>`, which has multiple properties. The other entries are like `<http://dbpedia.org/resource/...>` with properties pointing to Islamism.,2.5,3.01273,1.0,0.000,3.55,5.76639,0.93333,0.000
Alternatively, the user might want a CSV that lists all the properties of the Islamism entry. The example response shows the Islamism URI with its properties.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,4.625,7.24422,0.76,0.000
For the Islamism URI, the values would be:,1.5,3.01273,1.0,0.000,2.0,3.01273,1.0,0.000
