Okay, I need to generate a CSV file based on the user's instructions and the provided data. Let me start by understanding the data structure here.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,3.04474,6.97361,0.88462,0.083
I need to extract each triple from the given data. Each line starts with a subject, then has properties separated by semicolons. Each property is in the form nsX:property value or nsX:property <URI>.,3.16667,5.89142,0.9375,0.312,3.21429,6.35243,0.83333,0.000
For example, in the line:,0.5,1.85566,1.0,0.000,1.5,2.50045,1.0,0.000
1. Split the entire data into individual lines, each representing a subject with multiple predicates.,1.75,4.37319,1.0,0.250,2.0,4.10211,1.0,0.000
2. For each line, split by semicolons to get each predicate-object pair.,0.75,3.01273,1.0,0.000,3.33333,4.37319,1.0,0.000
Another thing to note is that some predicates have the same name but different namespaces (ns1, ns2). These should be treated as different predicates in the CSV.,8.0,5.78178,1.0,0.000,1.77273,5.02467,1.0,0.000
