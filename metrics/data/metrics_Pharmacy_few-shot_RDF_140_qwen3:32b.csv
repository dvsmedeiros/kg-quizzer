Looking at the data, for example:,1.5,3.01273,1.0,0.250,1.0,1.85566,1.0,0.000
So yes, the object is the Pharmacy resource. So each of these triples will be a row in the CSV with the entity and the predicate.,0.5,1.85566,1.0,0.000,3.76316,6.94911,0.83333,0.167
Now, I need to go through all the triples provided and extract the entities and their relations. Let's start by listing each entity and their corresponding predicate.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,5.819,7.13227,0.85185,0.037
2. For each such triple, take the subject (entity) and the predicate.,1.0,3.43523,1.0,0.000,4.5,4.25402,0.85714,0.000
Now, I need to extract all such triples from the provided data.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,5.5,5.02467,1.0,0.091
This becomes Revco,ns2:product,1.0,2.50045,1.0,0.000,1.0,1.85566,1.0,0.000
 Pierre Joseph Pelletier,ns2:academicDiscipline,1.0,2.50045,1.0,0.000,1.0,1.85566,1.0,0.000
Oleksandr Tikhonov,ns2:academicDiscipline,0.5,1.85566,1.0,0.000,1.0,1.85566,1.0,0.000
Oleksandr Tikhonov,ns1:fields,0.5,1.85566,1.0,0.000,1.0,1.85566,1.0,0.000
Now, need to go through all the triples in the provided data and extract these.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,6.2,5.63172,0.92857,0.071
For example, <http://dbpedia.org/resource/New_England_Compounding_Center> becomes New England Compounding Center.,0.5,1.85566,1.0,0.000,2.0,3.43523,1.0,0.000
1. For each subject in the triples, extract the part after http://dbpedia.org/resource/.,1.5,4.10211,1.0,0.000,3.2,3.79304,1.0,0.000
3. The predicate is as is, using the full namespace or abbreviation as present in the data.,0.75,3.95066,0.83333,0.000,2.83333,5.1549,0.90909,0.091
Now, let's process each triple in the provided data.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,3.54545,4.61384,1.0,0.222
Looking at the data, the first triple is:,1.5,3.01273,1.0,0.250,2.0,3.01273,1.0,0.000
So entity is Revco, relation is ns2:product.,1.5,3.01273,1.0,0.000,2.0,3.01273,1.0,0.000
Entity: Pierre Joseph Pelletier, relation: ns2:academicDiscipline.,1.2,3.01273,1.0,0.000,2.16667,2.50045,1.0,0.000
Entity: Oleksandr Tikhonov, relation: ns2:academicDiscipline.,1.0,2.50045,1.0,0.000,2.16667,2.50045,1.0,0.000
Now, proceeding to extract all such triples.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,2.42857,3.79304,1.0,0.000
Entity: Revue d'Histoire de la Pharmacie, relation: ns1:discipline.,1.55556,4.10211,1.0,0.286,2.16667,2.50045,1.0,0.000
Entity: Rite Aid, relation: ns1:products.,1.0,2.50045,1.0,0.000,2.16667,2.50045,1.0,0.000
Now, let's go through all the entries provided.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,3.1,4.37319,1.0,0.125
Yes, the line:,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,1.0,1.85566,1.0,0.000
Therefore, I need to process all the triples and collect unique combinations of entity and relation.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,5.9375,5.76639,0.93333,0.000
