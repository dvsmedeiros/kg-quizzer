Okay, let's tackle this. The user provided a bunch of RDF triples and wants a CSV generated from them. The main goal is to extract information about steam engines and related entities.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,4.08333,7.30371,0.90625,0.161
Starting with the Steam_engine entity. The triple says it has wikiPageUsesTemplate with several templates. So in the CSV, I'll list each template as a separate row for the Steam_engine entity under the wikiPageUsesTemplate attribute.,2.66667,6.35243,0.83333,0.000,3.31579,6.00792,0.94118,0.235
Then there's the hypernym, which is Engine. That's another single value.,1.16667,3.43523,1.0,0.200,1.55357,4.37319,1.0,0.125
For the depictions, there are multiple URLs. Each of these should be a separate entry under the depiction attribute for the Steam_engine entity.,1.0,2.50045,1.0,0.000,2.53529,6.31501,0.95,0.200
Similarly, other ships like USS_Vanderbilt have powerType as Steam_engine. So each of those will be entries in the CSV under their respective entities.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,4.48889,6.39884,1.0,0.000
I should also check for any other entities that might be in the data. For instance, the USS_Westfield_(1861) is another ship with shipPropulsion. All these need to be included.,2.28333,5.89142,0.9375,0.062,3.96429,5.51466,1.0,0.000
