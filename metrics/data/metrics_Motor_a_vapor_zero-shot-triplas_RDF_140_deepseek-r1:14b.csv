I'll start by identifying all the ships mentioned in the data that are connected to the Steam engine. Once I have that list, I can create general knowledge questions asking for these ships and their corresponding steam-powered vessels.,4.7619,6.94911,0.83333,0.042,4.0625,5.65316,1.0,0.067
Now, I'll structure the questions to be clear and specific. Each question should have a response that lists the ships mentioned in the data.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,3.93333,6.74206,0.91667,0.208
I need to make sure each pair is distinct and covers different aspects, like types of vessels or historical significance.,6.0,5.36491,1.0,0.000,2.875,4.10211,1.0,0.000
Maybe start with general questions about steam-powered ships and then get more specific, like asking about sidewheelers or naval ships.,6.0,5.36491,1.0,0.077,2.875,4.10211,1.0,0.143
   **Resposta:** Alguns exemplos incluem o USS Mount Vernon, o USS Nautilus e o USS Saratoga.,2.0,4.96484,0.9,0.000,1.625,4.44634,0.71429,0.000
   **Resposta:** Aplicações incluíram o transporte de passageiros e cargas, como o Wallamet (uma sidewheeler) e o Washington.,2.0,5.1549,0.90909,0.125,1.81818,4.51932,0.875,0.000
**Observação Final:** As respostas são baseadas nos dados fornecidos e estão associadas à navegação, construção naval e aplicações históricas da máquina a vapor.,2.36842,5.89142,0.9375,0.167,2.2,4.61384,1.0,0.667
