Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user provided a bunch of RDF data and wants me to generate a CSV file based on the given instructions and rules. Let me start by understanding the data and the requirements.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,3.20743,8.06051,0.76316,0.176
For example, the triple:,0.5,1.85566,1.0,0.000,1.0,1.85566,1.0,0.000
Property,Value,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000
ns2:committeeInLegislature,Audit,1.0,1.85566,1.0,0.000,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000
Property,Value,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000
ns1:committees,Europe and External Relations,1.0,1.85566,1.0,0.000,1.5,3.01273,1.0,0.000
Other should be processed to Government, Opposition Other.,2.5,3.79304,1.0,0.000,1.0,1.85566,1.0,0.000
Now, let me go through all the triples and list them out.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,3.58333,5.02467,1.0,0.000
ns2:leader has the URI <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alison_Johnstone>, so the value is Alison_Johnstone.,1.5,3.43523,1.0,0.000,2.5,3.43523,1.0,0.000
ns2:location is <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scotland>, so the value is Scotland.,1.0,2.50045,1.0,0.000,2.5,3.43523,1.0,0.000
ns2:politicalPartyInLegislature is <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Third_Sturgeon_government>, value Third_Sturgeon_government.,1.0,2.50045,1.0,0.000,1.0,1.85566,1.0,0.000
ns1:commons is yes, so that's a direct entry.,1.2,3.01273,1.0,0.000,1.5,3.79304,1.0,0.200
ns1:leader is <http://dbpedia.org/resource/George_Adam>, value George_Adam.,1.0,2.50045,1.0,0.000,1.0,1.85566,1.0,0.000
ns1:leader2Type is <http://dbpedia.org/resource/First_Minister_of_Scotland>, value First_Minister_of_Scotland.,1.0,2.50045,1.0,0.000,1.0,1.85566,1.0,0.000
ns1:leader4Type is <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Opposition_Parties_of_the_Scottish_Parliament>, value Opposition_Parties_of_the_Scottish_Parliament.,1.0,2.50045,1.0,0.000,1.0,1.85566,1.0,0.000
ns1:party is <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scottish_National_Party>, value Scottish_National_Party.,1.0,2.50045,1.0,0.000,1.0,1.85566,1.0,0.000
Other (with line breaks). The line breaks should be replaced with spaces, so the second value becomes Opposition Other.,2.96429,5.63648,0.75,0.000,3.5,4.10211,1.0,0.000
ns1:wikiPageUsesTemplate has multiple URIs. Each of these should be split into individual rows, extracting the local name.,2.92857,5.51466,1.0,0.071,2.0,3.01273,1.0,0.250
ns3:sameAs has a URI, so the value is 152958644.,1.0,3.43523,1.0,0.800,2.5,3.43523,1.0,0.000
