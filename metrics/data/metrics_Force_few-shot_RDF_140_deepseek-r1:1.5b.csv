Okay, I need to help the user generate a CSV based on the provided HTML snippet and some instructions. Let me start by understanding what's in the HTML.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,3.3443,7.09342,0.89286,0.038
I also see that each class is wrapped in multiple tags for styling, so I should extract the content within these tags to avoid including them incorrectly.,5.15385,5.36491,1.0,0.000,3.8,5.51466,1.0,0.000
Finally, I'll format the output as a CSV table for readability and ensure that it's clean before adding any styling or templates.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,4.15385,6.48214,1.0,0.217
