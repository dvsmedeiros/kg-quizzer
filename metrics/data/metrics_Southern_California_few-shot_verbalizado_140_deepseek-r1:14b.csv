Okay, so I need to create a CSV with 10 question-response pairs about Southern California based on the provided context and facts. Let me start by understanding what's given.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,3.58636,6.90264,1.0,0.038
Now, I'll go through each point and think of a question.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,3.53846,5.02467,1.0,0.364
7. Climate diversity: Southern California has varied climates, from Mediterranean to desert (like Imperial County) and coastal influences.,1.25,4.37319,1.0,0.000,5.23077,4.82961,1.0,0.000
8. Rivers: Colorado River in the east, mentioned in the context.,0.96429,4.10211,1.0,0.000,2.0,3.01273,1.0,0.000
9. Economic importance: The abstract says it's a major economic center, so maybe that's a question.,1.32692,5.32781,0.91667,0.182,1.625,3.79304,1.0,0.200
Wait, I think I need to make sure each question is unique and covers different aspects without overlapping.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,8.5,6.00792,0.94118,0.000
   - Context says ten, so Quantos condados compõem o sul da Califórnia? R: Dez.,1.5,2.50045,1.0,0.000,1.80556,4.82961,1.0,0.125
   - San Bernardino County. So, Qual condado do sul da Califórnia compartilha uma fronteira com Nevada? R: Condado de San Bernardino.,1.0,3.01273,1.0,0.000,2.35714,5.89142,0.9375,0.200
   - Los Angeles metropolitan area is mentioned as the second most populous urban agglomeration. So,  Qual é a maior cidade do sul da Califórnia? R: Los Angeles.,1.6,5.51466,1.0,0.000,1.95,5.20226,1.0,0.375
   - Colorado River. So, Qual rio forma a fronteira leste com Arizona? R: Rio Colorado.,0.75,2.50045,1.0,0.000,1.8,5.1549,0.90909,0.500
Alternatively, focus on specific features like the presence of mountain ranges or natural landmarks.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,5.0,5.36491,1.0,0.077
   - Sierra Nevada is mentioned in context? Let me check: No, but it's adjacent to San Bernardino County which borders Nevada. Maybe the Sierra Madre? Or perhaps the question is about natural features not explicitly named.,2.65,4.82961,1.0,0.000,2.80983,6.79098,0.96154,0.077
Wait, but the area is given in two units: 56505 mi² and 146347300000.0 m². So I can use either.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,3.04412,6.01374,1.0,0.000
Alternatively, another approach: What region does Southern California expand into to the east?,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,4.0,5.20226,1.0,0.000
- It expands into Arizona via the Colorado River and desert areas. So, Em qual estado o sul da Califórnia se expande para leste? R: Arizona,3.0,5.20226,1.0,0.083,1.66667,5.36491,1.0,0.429
Wait, but the context says it's adjacent to Nevada to the northeast as well.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,3.75,5.76263,0.85714,0.071
Hmm, perhaps better to structure questions around specific geographical aspects without overlapping.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,4.75,5.02467,1.0,0.000
Wait, but some of these might be too specific or not covered in the context. Let me make sure each question is answerable based on the provided info.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,5.31429,6.85711,0.96296,0.000
- Southernmost point: Tijuana, Mexico,2.0,2.50045,1.0,0.000,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000
- Economic center: Yes, as per context,2.0,2.50045,1.0,0.000,0.66667,2.50045,1.0,0.000
Now, ensuring that each question is distinct and covers different aspects without overlap.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,5.23077,5.20226,1.0,0.000
