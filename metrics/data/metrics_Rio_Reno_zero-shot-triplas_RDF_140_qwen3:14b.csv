Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs based on the provided context and facts. Let me start by reviewing the context and the facts to identify relevant information.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,4.36667,7.39593,0.78571,0.000
Now, I need to form questions that can be answered directly from these details. Let me brainstorm possible questions:,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,4.16667,6.11685,0.94444,0.000
Now, checking the answers from the facts:,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,3.0,3.95066,0.83333,0.000
1. Length is 1,233 km.,0.75,3.17866,0.75,0.000,1.0,1.85566,1.0,0.000
But I need to make sure each question is distinct. Alternatively, maybe use different aspects. Let me try to finalize the list:,2.5,5.02467,1.0,0.000,2.05,5.02467,1.0,0.000
That should cover 10 distinct questions. Now, I can format them as per the required structure.,0.92857,4.10211,1.0,0.000,2.3,4.61384,1.0,0.000
   Mar do Norte, via delta Reno-rio Mosa-rio Escalda  ,1.0,2.50045,1.0,0.333,1.4,3.43523,1.0,0.200
   0,0 metros  ,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,0.5,1.85566,1.0,0.000
   Como um rio, corpo de água natural e via navegável  ,0.66667,2.50045,1.0,1.000,1.0,4.10211,1.0,0.800
