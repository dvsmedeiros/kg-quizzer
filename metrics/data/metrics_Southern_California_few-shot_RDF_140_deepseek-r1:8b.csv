Okay, I need to help the user convert the provided RDF data into a CSV format based on their instructions and rules. Let me start by understanding what they're asking for.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,4.11742,7.09349,0.96774,0.034
I notice that each property in the RDF uses either `ns1` or `ns2` as the namespace prefix. For example, `ns1:areaTotal` and `ns2:name`. I'll need to map these to their respective headers in the CSV.,3.61364,6.21898,0.94737,0.000,3.51667,6.11685,0.94444,0.000
Finally, I'll structure the CSV with headers followed by rows of data. Each row will represent a property and its corresponding value.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,3.73701,6.39884,1.0,0.227
I should also make sure that special characters like commas within the values are handled properly, perhaps by enclosing such fields in quotes.,6.625,5.78178,1.0,0.000,2.875,4.10211,1.0,0.000
ns1:areaTotal,146347300000.0,1.0,1.85566,1.0,0.000,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000
ns1:country,United States,1.0,1.85566,1.0,0.000,0.5,1.85566,1.0,0.000
ns2:areaTotalSqMi,56505,1.0,1.85566,1.0,0.000,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000
ns2:name,Southern California,1.0,1.85566,1.0,0.000,0.5,1.85566,1.0,0.000
ns2:seatType,Largest city,1.0,1.85566,1.0,0.000,0.5,1.85566,1.0,0.000
Este CSV inclui todas as propriedades e valores extra√≠dos da RDF original, organizados em ordem sequencial. Cada linha representa uma propriedade com seu respectivo valor.,1.33333,5.20226,1.0,0.286,1.6,5.36491,1.0,0.500
