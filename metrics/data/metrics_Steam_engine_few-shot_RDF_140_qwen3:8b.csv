Okay, I need to generate a CSV file based on the provided data. Let me start by understanding the data structure and the user's instructions. ,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,3.71026,6.90937,0.88,0.087
3. Handle all relevant entries, including the dcterms:subject and ns3:hypernym for Steam_engine.,1.0,3.43523,1.0,0.000,3.08333,4.61384,1.0,0.000
4. Ensure that each property is listed as a separate row, even if there are multiple objects for the same predicate.,1.25,5.02467,1.0,0.364,3.18182,4.82961,1.0,0.000
First, the Steam_engine subject has several predicates:,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,3.0,3.79304,1.0,0.000
But the user mentioned including the Steam_engine entry as a subject. That entry is part of the data, so it should be included. ,3.58333,6.35243,0.83333,0.278,2.5,3.43523,1.0,0.000
Therefore, the CSV should include all these triples. ,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,3.5,4.10211,1.0,0.000
Now, the challenge is to convert the entire dataset into a CSV with the correct headers and rows. ,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,4.22222,6.12437,0.88235,0.235
- The URIs are correctly formatted, possibly with quotes if needed.,2.5,3.43523,1.0,0.000,2.0,3.43523,1.0,0.000
I need to ensure that all the triples from the provided data are included, with each triple as a row. ,4.21429,5.63172,0.92857,0.071,2.14286,3.79304,1.0,0.667
