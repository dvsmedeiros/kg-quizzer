Okay, I need to generate a CSV file based on the given instructions and the provided data. Let me start by understanding what the user is asking for. ,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,4.40686,6.94335,0.92593,0.040
Another consideration is that some entries might not have all the properties. So the CSV should have headers for each possible property, and empty cells where the data isn't present.,3.86538,6.58989,0.90909,0.000,3.0,4.61384,1.0,0.250
3. For each resource, list the corresponding values in the columns.,0.75,3.01273,1.0,0.000,3.5,4.25402,0.85714,0.000
However, the user's instruction is to generate a CSV based on the provided data. So I need to parse all the resources and their properties.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,4.28125,6.90937,0.88,0.083
Now, compiling all this into a CSV:,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,2.0,3.79304,1.0,0.000
Alternatively, each resource could have multiple rows if there are multiple values. But that would require more complex handling.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,3.8125,6.11685,0.94444,0.000
And each row corresponds to a resource, with the values as per the data.,1.71429,4.10211,1.0,0.571,1.875,4.25402,0.85714,0.167
Now, applying this to the provided data:,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,3.0,3.79304,1.0,0.167
- wikiPageUsesTemplate: Template:DEU, Template:More_citations_needed_section,1.83333,2.50045,1.0,0.000,1.0,1.85566,1.0,0.000
Therefore, the CSV would be:,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,2.0,3.01273,1.0,0.000
But I need to check if the data for wikiPageUsesTemplate is two entries: Template:DEU and Template:More_citations_needed_section. So the value would be Template:DEU, Template:More_citations_needed_section.,3.97727,7.01304,0.84,0.040,1.5,1.85566,1.0,0.000
But I need to make sure that the CSV formatting is correct, with commas and quotes where necessary.,5.5,5.20226,1.0,0.000,3.0,3.79304,1.0,0.000
But I need to check if the closeMatch and depiction are single values. Yes, they are.,3.25,5.51466,1.0,0.000,1.0,1.85566,1.0,0.000
Therefore, the final answer is the CSV with the above structure.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,3.18182,5.12344,0.8,0.200
Here's the CSV representation of the provided data, structured with columns for each property. Multiple values for a property are separated by commas within the same cell:,3.0,4.75438,0.88889,0.222,2.92857,6.32762,0.89474,0.211
- **`wikiPageUsesTemplate`**: Two templates (`Template:DEU`, `Template:More_citations_needed_section`) listed in the same cell.,4.47059,4.25402,0.85714,0.000,3.25,4.10211,1.0,0.000
