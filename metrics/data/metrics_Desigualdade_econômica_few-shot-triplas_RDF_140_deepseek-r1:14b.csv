First, I should understand the content. The context explains that economic inequality refers to the distribution of income and wealth among individuals or groups. It mentions different measures like the Gini Coefficient and the Human Development Index adjusted for inequality. It also discusses how globalization has reduced global inequality but increased it within countries.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,5.29461,8.38495,0.83019,0.000
The user provided examples of questions that focus on specific data points, such as percentages of wealth owned by certain groups or methodologies used by organizations. These examples suggest that the questions should be fact-based and extractable from the given content.,5.5,5.20226,1.0,0.083,5.70208,7.06263,0.93103,0.000
- Types of inequality: income, wealth.,2.5,3.01273,1.0,0.000,0.5,1.0,1.0,0.000

Now, I'll draft questions around these areas. Each question should be clear and have a direct answer from the context.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,2.97619,6.21768,1.0,0.200
1. **Gini Coefficient**: Since it's mentioned as the most used measure, a question about its role makes sense.,1.57353,5.63172,0.92857,0.071,2.875,4.10211,1.0,0.000
2. **Human Development Index**: It's adjusted for inequality, so a question on that would fit.,2.21429,5.47097,0.83333,0.083,2.375,4.10211,1.0,0.000
3. **Globalization Impact**: The context states globalization reduced global inequality but increased within countries, which is a good point for a question.,1.88889,6.25277,0.82353,0.000,2.0,4.51932,0.875,0.000
4. **Wealth Distribution**: Specific percentages can be pulled from the examples, like 1% owning 40% of wealth.,2.11667,5.48607,0.92308,0.000,2.22222,4.51932,0.875,0.000
7. **Causes of Occupy Movements**: The RDF data links Occupy events to economic inequality, so a question about their cause fits.,2.27778,6.01226,0.875,0.062,2.375,4.10211,1.0,0.000
I'll structure each question to target these points, ensuring variety and coverage of different aspects. The answers should directly reflect information from the context or examples provided.,3.0,4.61384,1.0,0.000,4.75,6.21898,0.94737,0.000
Each question targets a distinct aspect of economic inequality, ensuring a comprehensive coverage based on the provided content.,1.66667,4.61384,1.0,0.444,3.2,4.61384,1.0,0.000
