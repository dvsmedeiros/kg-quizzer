Here, the object is a URL.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,1.66667,3.43523,1.0,0.000
For example, the line:,0.5,1.85566,1.0,0.000,1.0,1.85566,1.0,0.000
Similarly, the line:,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,1.0,1.85566,1.0,0.000
This has two URLs as the object, so this should be split into two rows.,1.28571,4.10211,1.0,0.000,3.33333,4.37319,1.0,0.000
1. Split all the lines into individual triples, handling the cases where the object has multiple values.,1.75,4.37319,1.0,0.125,4.5,4.75438,0.88889,0.000
3. If the object is a list (like the data or wikiPageUsesTemplate), split into separate rows.,1.63462,5.32781,0.91667,0.417,1.6,3.01273,1.0,0.000
Now, I'll need to process each line accordingly. Let's go through the data step by step.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,3.32273,6.00792,0.94118,0.118
Wait, that's the same as the previous line. Maybe a duplicate.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,1.675,5.1549,0.90909,0.100
And this pattern continues for many other entities, each with similar properties.,1.75,4.37319,1.0,0.000,1.6,3.01273,1.0,0.000
After processing all these entities, we come to the line for Construction itself:,2.0,3.43523,1.0,0.000,2.22222,4.37319,1.0,0.000
This has four data points. So, split into four rows:,1.0,3.79304,1.0,0.167,2.0,3.01273,1.0,0.000
This has two templates. So, split into two rows:,0.8,3.43523,1.0,0.000,2.0,3.01273,1.0,0.000
3. **Duplicates**: Duplicate entries (e.g., `ns1:service` for Abengoa) are retained as they appear in the source data.,1.70455,4.25402,0.85714,0.000,3.16667,5.36491,1.0,0.083
