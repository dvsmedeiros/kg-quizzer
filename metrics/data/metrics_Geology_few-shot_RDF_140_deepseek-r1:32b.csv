Okay, I need to figure out how to generate a CSV based on the given instructions and rules. Let me start by understanding what was provided.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,3.30556,6.7216,0.96,0.000
Now, looking at the sample CSV provided by the user:,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,4.5,4.75438,0.88889,0.000
Potential issues I might face include handling different namespaces uniformly or ensuring that all predicates are correctly captured. Also, maintaining consistency in how source nodes are named is important to avoid duplicates or mismatches.,2.76316,6.11885,1.0,0.053,4.0625,5.65316,1.0,0.000
Por favor, me informe se deseja mais detalhes ou ajustes!,0.5,1.85566,1.0,1.000,2.11111,4.37319,1.0,0.000
