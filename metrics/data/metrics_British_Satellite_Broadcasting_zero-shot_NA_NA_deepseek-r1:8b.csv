Okay, so I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs based on the given context about BSB and its merger with Sky Television. Let me start by reading through the context carefully.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,4.78636,7.11842,0.93333,0.000
For each question, I need a relevant one and a short correct answer. Let me brainstorm some questions:,1.0,2.50045,1.0,0.000,2.46212,5.76639,0.93333,0.357
   - November 2, 1990,1.0,1.85566,1.0,0.000,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000
Wait, some of these might overlap or be too similar. I should check for uniqueness and make sure each question is distinct.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,4.05769,6.31084,1.0,0.000
3. What date was the merger? Answer: November 2, 1990,1.16667,4.61384,1.0,0.000,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000
9. After merger, what entity was formed? BSB and Sky formed BSkyB?,0.5,2.50045,1.0,0.000,1.8,4.75438,0.88889,0.000
Wait, maybe I should adjust some to ensure accuracy.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,4.0,4.37319,1.0,0.000
