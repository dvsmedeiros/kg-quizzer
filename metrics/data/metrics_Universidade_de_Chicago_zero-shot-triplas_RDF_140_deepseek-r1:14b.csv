Alright, so I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs based on the provided RDF data about the University of Chicago. Let me start by understanding what's given here.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,3.95227,6.92021,0.96429,0.074
First, I'll parse the data to extract all the key points:,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,4.46154,5.1549,0.90909,0.091
1. **People Associated with the University**: There are many individuals listed who have connections with the University of Chicago. For example, Milton Friedman (http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rose_Friedman) and Saul Padover.,2.375,6.882,0.82609,0.000,3.38462,4.10211,1.0,0.000
Wait, but I only need to generate 10 pairs. So maybe I can break it down further:,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,3.05556,5.89142,0.9375,0.000
I realize I might be repeating some information here, so perhaps I should diversify the questions more. Let's think about other aspects:,4.0,4.75438,0.88889,0.000,2.79167,5.51466,1.0,0.071
Wait, maybe I should clarify that each Q&A pair should be distinct and cover various attributes of the university. So let's list out possible questions:,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,3.61111,6.85711,0.96296,0.037
Alternatively, maybe each pair should focus on a specific person or fact. Let me try to list them:,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,2.52976,5.90165,1.0,0.250
   - Hmm, maybe not enough info here.,0.5,1.0,1.0,0.000,2.0,3.43523,1.0,0.000
