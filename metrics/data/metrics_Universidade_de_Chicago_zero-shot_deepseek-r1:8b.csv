Okay, I need to create 10 multiple-choice questions based on the University of Chicago context provided. Each question should be unique and related to different aspects of the content. The answers must be correct and directly derivable from the given information.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,5.08333,7.93879,0.825,0.000
I should ensure that each question targets a different area to maintain variety. For example, one question could focus on notable alumni while another might ask about a significant research breakthrough. I'll make sure the questions are clear and directly related to the information given without requiring external knowledge beyond what's provided.,1.89286,5.65316,1.0,0.267,6.25113,7.46481,0.97436,0.128
I'll formulate questions that cover each of these areas, ensuring each has one correct answer. I need to ensure that the answers are explicitly stated or can be inferred from the context without ambiguity.,3.45455,4.82961,1.0,0.000,5.13929,6.7216,0.96,0.000
