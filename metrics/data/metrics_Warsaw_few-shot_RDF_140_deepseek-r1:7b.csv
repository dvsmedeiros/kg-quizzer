Okay, I need to help the user generate a CSV file based on the provided data. Let me start by understanding what they're asking for.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,3.30208,6.7216,0.96,0.043
I should also look for any other non-weather data that could fit into the CSV format but it seems most of this data is about Warsaw's weather. So, perhaps only focusing on the weather-related entries makes sense here.,3.48333,6.98051,0.96552,0.069,3.63636,4.82961,1.0,0.000
