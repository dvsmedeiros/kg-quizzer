Okay, I need to generate a CSV file based on the user's instructions and rules. Let me start by understanding the requirements.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,2.26838,6.49101,0.95455,0.050
- ns1:imageCaption The Rhine in Basel, Switzerland,2.0,3.79304,1.0,0.000,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000
Wait, but the example in the user's message had entries like:,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,2.92308,5.1549,0.90909,0.091
- ns1:imageCaption The Rhine in Basel, Switzerland,2.0,3.79304,1.0,0.000,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000
- ns1:subdivisionType Countries, Rhine Basin,1.4,2.50045,1.0,0.000,0.5,1.85566,1.0,0.000
- dcterms:subject <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:France–Germany_border>, etc.,1.5,1.85566,1.0,0.000,0.5,1.0,1.0,1.000
- foaf:depiction <http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Above_Tomasee.jpg>, etc.,1.5,1.85566,1.0,0.000,0.5,1.0,1.0,1.000
Same for the wikiPageUsesTemplate, which lists multiple templates. Each should be a separate row.,0.75,3.01273,1.0,0.000,1.65714,4.82961,1.0,0.400
The same applies to dcterms:subject, which has multiple categories.,3.0,3.79304,1.0,0.000,1.6,3.01273,1.0,0.000
For example, <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Template:As_of> becomes Template:As_of.,0.5,1.85566,1.0,0.000,2.0,2.50045,1.0,0.000
Similarly, <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:France–Germany_border> becomes Category:France–Germany_border.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,2.14286,2.50045,1.0,0.000
4. For the wikiPageUsesTemplate and other predicates with multiple values, split them into separate rows.,2.25,4.82961,1.0,0.000,2.0,3.43523,1.0,0.000
Now, let's go through each triple and apply this.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,3.54545,4.61384,1.0,0.111
Now, putting all these into the CSV.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,2.42857,3.79304,1.0,0.000
Same for dcterms:subject, etc.,1.0,3.01273,1.0,0.000,0.5,1.0,1.0,1.000
This would result in a large number of rows, but that's what the user's example showed.,1.44444,4.61384,1.0,0.444,2.5,4.75438,0.88889,0.111
Here's the structured CSV output based on the provided triples and abstract, following the required format:,2.57143,5.48607,0.92308,0.077,2.0,3.01273,1.0,0.000
Rhine,dcter,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000
