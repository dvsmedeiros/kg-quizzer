Okay, I need to generate a CSV file based on the provided data. Let me start by understanding the data and the instructions.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,3.16783,6.69635,0.86364,0.050
Now, the task is to extract all these entries and format them into a CSV. Let me go through the data step by step.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,4.38333,6.66798,0.91304,0.048
I need to make sure that all entries are included. The user might have a lot of entries, so I need to process each line.,3.1875,6.11685,0.94444,0.222,3.5,4.10211,1.0,0.000
Let me check if there are any inconsistencies. For example, some entries might have different namespaces. The user might want to include both ns1 and ns2 properties in the CSV.,1.47222,4.82961,1.0,0.000,3.41429,6.42016,0.9,0.000
I need to make sure that the name is correctly extracted from the subject URI. For example, http://dbpedia.org/resource/William_Smith_Shaw becomes William Smith Shaw.,3.21875,6.00792,0.94118,0.000,2.8,3.79304,1.0,0.000
Once all entries are processed, the CSV should be generated. Let me proceed to create the CSV with all these entries.,2.0,3.43523,1.0,0.000,3.04167,6.01226,0.875,0.000
