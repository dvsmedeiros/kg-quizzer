Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs based on the provided data. Let me start by understanding the information given.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,3.02137,6.31501,0.95,0.053
Wait, some of these might be duplicates. Let me check the data again.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,2.57143,5.20226,1.0,0.100
Also, the answer about the primary topic is the Steam Engine itself.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,5.5,5.30531,0.81818,0.000
   Resposta: Exemplos incluem o USS_Shenandoah_(1862), o Wallamet_(1853_sidewheeler) e o Washington_(steamboat_1851).,1.6,3.79304,1.0,0.000,3.0,4.25402,0.85714,0.000
    Resposta: O engenho a vapor foi fundamental na navegação, proporcionando propulsão a navios e embarcações.,1.3,4.61384,1.0,0.667,1.57143,3.79304,1.0,0.000
   Resposta: Exemplos incluem o USS_Shenandoah_(1862), o Wallamity_(1853_sidewheeler) e o Washington_(steamboat_1851).,1.6,3.79304,1.0,0.000,3.0,4.25402,0.85714,0.000
   Resposta: O engenho a vapor é um dispositivo que converte energia térmica em trabalho mecânico, utilizado como fonte de propulsão em navios e embarcações.,1.25,5.65316,1.0,0.600,2.2,4.61384,1.0,0.200
Another point is the depictions, which are listed in the data. So maybe another question about that.,2.0,3.43523,1.0,0.000,2.21429,5.20226,1.0,0.083
But since the data doesn't explicitly state that, maybe it's better to stick to the examples given.,2.2,4.61384,1.0,0.222,3.41667,4.96484,0.9,0.100
   Resposta: O engenho a vapor proporciona propulsão a navios e embarcações, sendo fundamental na navegação.,1.33333,5.1549,0.90909,0.286,1.4,3.01273,1.0,0.667
Alternatively, maybe the answer is that the Steam Engine is the power source for the listed ships.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,5.76471,6.29661,0.75,0.000
   Resposta: Exemplos incluem o USS_Shenandoah_(1862), o Wallamet_(1853_sidewheeler) e o Washington_(steamboat_1851).  ,1.6,3.79304,1.0,0.000,3.0,4.25402,0.85714,0.000
   Resposta: O engenho a vapor proporciona propulsão a navios e embarcações, sendo fundamental na navegação.,1.33333,5.1549,0.90909,0.286,1.4,3.01273,1.0,0.667
