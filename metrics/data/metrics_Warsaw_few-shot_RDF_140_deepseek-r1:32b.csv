Okay, so I've been given this task to convert a bunch of RDF data into a CSV format based on some instructions and rules. Let me try to figure out how to approach this step by step.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,4.15659,7.67754,0.86486,0.143
I also need to make sure not to miss any entities. There are many individuals and organizations listed, each requiring a separate row.,4.25,6.11685,0.94444,0.000,1.5,3.43523,1.0,0.000
