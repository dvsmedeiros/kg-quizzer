Okay, so I need to generate a CSV based on the given data. Let me first understand what's provided.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,2.44444,6.11885,1.0,0.118
The user mentioned a final instruction to generate a CSV according to specific instructions and rules. Since I can't see those rules, I'll make educated guesses based on typical RDF-to-CSV conversions.,2.34191,6.77102,0.86957,0.318,4.0,4.82961,1.0,0.000
First, I'll identify the subjects and predicates. The first set of triplets has subjects like http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_States_Army_Reserve with predicate ns1:instance_of pointing to http://dbpedia.org/resource/Force. These look like instances of Force.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.000,3.64713,7.43343,0.83871,0.000
The second part defines properties of the Force concept, such as its unit (Newton) and some templates used. This might be metadata about the Force class itself rather than individual instances.,4.0,4.75438,0.88889,0.000,4.54167,6.39884,1.0,0.048
The second part has more complex data about the Force class itself. It defines that the unit of force is Newton and lists templates used. So, these would be separate rows with predicates like unit and wikiPageUsesTemplate.,3.90476,6.97361,0.88462,0.040,4.75,5.02467,1.0,0.000
I'll need to handle each triplet individually, ensuring that each line correctly represents one statement.,2.55556,4.37319,1.0,0.000,3.33333,4.37319,1.0,0.000
