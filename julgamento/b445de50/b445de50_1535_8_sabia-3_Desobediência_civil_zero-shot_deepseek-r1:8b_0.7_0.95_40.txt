  "justificativa": "The pair is contextually complex, requiring understanding of the concept of civil disobedience. The response is nearly complete but could be more detailed. It is totally correct and coherent. The fluency is good, but not perfect for a native Portuguese speaker, as the response is in English. The Portuguese quality is acceptable with minimal translation issues."
