  "justificativa": "The question requires understanding the concept of twin primes and their distribution, which is moderately complex. The response is complete and accurate, providing the exact number of twin prime pairs below 10,000. The fluency is good in English, but since the evaluation requires the use of Portuguese, the quality of Portuguese is poor as the response is not in Portuguese."
