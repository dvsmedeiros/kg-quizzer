  "qualidade_portugues": 3,
  "justificativa": "The complexity is moderate as it requires specific geographical knowledge. The completeness and correctness are full since the response accurately states the location of the Rhine's source. The fluency is good but not perfect for a native Portuguese speaker due to the use of English. The quality of Portuguese is acceptable as there are no major errors, but the response should ideally be in Portuguese for full accuracy."
