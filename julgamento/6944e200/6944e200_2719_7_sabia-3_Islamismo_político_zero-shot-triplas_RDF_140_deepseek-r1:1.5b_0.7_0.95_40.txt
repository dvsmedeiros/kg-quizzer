  "complexidade": 2,
  "completude": 1,
  "corretude": 3,
  "fluidez": 4,
  "qualidade_portugues": 4,
  "justificativa": "The complexity is low as it requires basic understanding of the influence of a religious movement. The completeness is poor because the answer does not specifically address Ismailism, but rather Islamism in general. The correctness is moderate as the values mentioned are generally associated with Islamism, but the specific influence of Ismailism is not detailed. The fluidity is good, with a natural and clear structure. The quality of Portuguese is high, though the answer would ideally be more detailed and specific to Ismailism."
