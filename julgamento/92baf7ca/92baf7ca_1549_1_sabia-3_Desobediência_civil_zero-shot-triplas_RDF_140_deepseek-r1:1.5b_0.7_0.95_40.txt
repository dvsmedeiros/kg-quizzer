  "qualidade_portugues": 3,
  "justificativa": "The complexity is low as the response does not delve deeply into the specific motivations and context of the movement. The completeness is adequate but not comprehensive, lacking specific details about the movement's goals and circumstances. The correctness is compromised by an anachronism: the Soviet Union dissolved in 1991, and the movement occurred in 2015–2016, under a different political context. Fluency is good, with natural sentence structure. The Portuguese quality is acceptable, featuring minor translation issues but overall understandable."
