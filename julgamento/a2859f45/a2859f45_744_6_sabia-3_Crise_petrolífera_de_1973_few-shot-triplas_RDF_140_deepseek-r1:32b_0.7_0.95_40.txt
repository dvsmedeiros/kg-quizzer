  "justificativa": "The question requires understanding the context of the 1973 oil crisis beyond initial facts, hence medium complexity. The response is complete, correctly identifying the additional countries. It is coherent and logically sound. The fluency is natural in English, but translating it to Portuguese would slightly affect the naturalness. The quality of Portuguese is good, assuming a competent translation, with only minor issues likely."
