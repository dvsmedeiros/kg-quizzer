  "corretude": 5,
  "fluidez": 4,
  "qualidade_portugues": 3,
  "justificativa": "The complexity is moderate as it requires understanding historical context and religious conflict. The completeness is almost total, missing slight depth on the political aspects. The correctness is precise and coherent with the question. The fluency is good but not perfect, as the translation to Portuguese could be smoother. The quality of Portuguese has some minor issues, such as word choice and sentence structure, but it is mostly understandable."
