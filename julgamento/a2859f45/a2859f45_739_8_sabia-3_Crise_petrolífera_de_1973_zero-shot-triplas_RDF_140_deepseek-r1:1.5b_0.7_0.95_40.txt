  "justificativa": "The question and answer require an understanding of the context of the 1973 oil crisis and its impact, which is not purely factual but also involves implications on supply chains. The completeness is adequate but lacks specific details about the situation in Asia. The correctness is high but not perfect as it could benefit from more precise data. The fluidity is good, providing a clear and concise statement. However, the quality of Portuguese is only acceptable as the response is in English and should be translated for full accuracy."
