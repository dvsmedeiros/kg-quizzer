  "justificativa": "The complexity is minimal as it requires factual recall with slight context understanding. The completeness is only partial because the precise start date of October, rather than September, is not mentioned. The correctness suffers from a factual error regarding the month of proclamation and the mistranslation of 'Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries' to 'Organization of the Pairs de Petróleo Abanados'. The fluidity is acceptable but not natural due to the mistranslation. The quality of Portuguese is reasonable, with some translation issues and minor grammatical errors, but it is mostly comprehensible."
