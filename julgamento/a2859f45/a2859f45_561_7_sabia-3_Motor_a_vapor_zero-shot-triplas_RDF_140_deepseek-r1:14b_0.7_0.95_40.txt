  "fluidez": 4,
  "qualidade_portugues": 4,
  "justificativa": "The pair is contextually valid, as James Watt is indeed a key figure in steam engine history. The complexity is moderate because it requires recognizing a historical figure's association rather than deep analysis. The completeness is nearly total as it identifies Watt but could briefly mention his specific contributions. The correctness is accurate and coherent. The fluidity is good, though the translation to Portuguese could be slightly more natural. The Portuguese quality is mostly correct with minor translation nuances."
