  "justificativa": "A pergunta Ã© simples e factual, focusing on the impact of a known event. The response is partially complete as it mentions three countries, but does not cover all initially targeted nations like the Netherlands and the UK. It is mostly correct but omits key details for full accuracy. The fluency is good, with natural phrasing, but the translation to Portuguese would benefit from more precision to maintain clarity and correctness in the target language."
