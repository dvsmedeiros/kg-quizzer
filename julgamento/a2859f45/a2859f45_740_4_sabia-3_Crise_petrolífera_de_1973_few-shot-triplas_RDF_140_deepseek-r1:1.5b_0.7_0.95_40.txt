  "justificativa": "The complexity is low as it requires basic understanding of the crisis context. The completeness is partial because it doesn't fully explain the motivations behind the separation, such as economic and political pressures. Correctness is moderate as the answer implies a separation that was more about avoiding economic repercussions than specifically avoiding being a supplier. Fluency is acceptable but lacks natural phrasing for a complete understanding. The quality of Portuguese is fair, with the answer being translated directly, which may not convey the nuances effectively."
