  "justificativa": "The pair is moderately complex as it requires understanding the context of the oil embargo and its economic impact. The response is adequate but lacks details on Europe's specific effects. It is mostly correct, though the price increase is somewhat imprecise. The fluency is good for English, but since the evaluation is for Portuguese, the quality of Portuguese is very low as the response is not translated."
