  "justificativa": "The pair is moderately complex as it requires understanding the context of the 1973 oil crisis. The response is nearly complete, providing the cause and price range increase, though it could mention the specific countries affected by the embargo. It is correct in stating the crisis as the cause and the price increase. The fluency is good for a concise explanation, but since the original prompt and context were in Portuguese, the response should also be in Portuguese, resulting in a lower score for quality of Portuguese."
