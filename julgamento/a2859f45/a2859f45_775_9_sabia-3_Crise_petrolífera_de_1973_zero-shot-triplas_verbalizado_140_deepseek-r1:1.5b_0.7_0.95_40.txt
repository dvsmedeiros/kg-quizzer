  "justificativa": "The pair is moderately complex, requiring understanding of economic impacts. The answer is adequate but could be more comprehensive by detailing specific economic consequences beyond price increases. It is mostly correct but lacks depth in explaining the broader effects. The fluency is good, though it could be more nuanced for a higher score. The quality of Portuguese is acceptable but not impeccable, as the original response was in English and needs translation."
