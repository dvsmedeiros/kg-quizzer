  "justificativa": "The pair has moderate complexity, as it touches on essential life processes but without requiring deep inferential reasoning. The completeness is adequate but does not cover all aspects related to oxygen's role in organisms, such as its involvement in cellular respiration. The correctness is high but slightly lacks precision, especially regarding the mention of 'combustion' which is not directly related to organism survival. Fluency is good, with natural sentences, but could be improved for a native Portuguese speaker. The quality of Portuguese is acceptable with minor issues such as the use of 'combustion' in a biological context where 'respiração celular' might be more precise."
