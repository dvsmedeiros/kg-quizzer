  "justificativa": "The question asks about the impact of the crisis on technology and innovation, which is a contextually rich topic. The response indicates that technological advancements were a result of supply chain disruptions, showing some understanding but not fully capturing the nuances and broader effects. It is moderately complete and correct, but lacks depth. The fluency and quality of Portuguese translation are acceptable but not perfect, as the sentence structure could be improved for clarity."
