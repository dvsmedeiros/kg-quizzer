  "justificativa": "The pair requires understanding of historical context, making it of medium complexity. The answer is adequate but lacks specificity about the exact year (1685) of the Edict of Nantes revocation. It is mostly correct and coherent, with minor issues in preciseness. The fluency is good for English, but for a Portuguese evaluation, the translation would need improvements to reach fluency and correctness in the language."
