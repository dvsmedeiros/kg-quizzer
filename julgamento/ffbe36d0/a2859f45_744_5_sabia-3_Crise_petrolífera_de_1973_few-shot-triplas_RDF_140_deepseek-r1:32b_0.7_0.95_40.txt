  "justificativa": "The pair has medium complexity as it requires knowledge of historical context and specific terminology. The answer is almost completely correct, providing the nickname but slightly lacking the full quotation mark at the end. Fluency is good, though not perfect due to the quotation mark issue. The quality of Portuguese is adequate, considering the translation from the original English question and answer."
