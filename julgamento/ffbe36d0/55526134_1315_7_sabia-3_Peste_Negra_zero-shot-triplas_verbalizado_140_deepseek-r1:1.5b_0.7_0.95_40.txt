  "pergunta": "How does the Black Death impact public health today?",

  "completude": 1,
  "corretude": 3,
  "fluidez": 4,
  "qualidade_portugues": 4,
  "justificativa": "The complexity is minimal as the response does not delve into current public health impacts but rather describes historical consequences. The completeness is poor because the question asks about present impacts, which are not addressed. The correctness is acceptable, though not entirely precise, as it correctly refers to historical effects. Fluency is good, with clear and natural sentences in Portuguese. The quality of Portuguese is high, with minor issues such as the use of 'global' which could be more contextually appropriate if replaced with 'mundial'."
