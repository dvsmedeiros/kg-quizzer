  "justificativa": "The interaction requires understanding of context (a sick puppy and Biscui's reaction), which is adequately addressed by calling for help. The response is complete enough within its simplicity, correctly aligns with the question, and reads naturally. However, there are slight grammatical issues, such as the use of 'called out for help' which could be smoother in Portuguese."
