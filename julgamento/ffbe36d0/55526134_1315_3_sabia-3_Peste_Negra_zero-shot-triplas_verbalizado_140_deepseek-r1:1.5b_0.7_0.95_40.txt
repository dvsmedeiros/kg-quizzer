  "justificativa": "The pair has moderate complexity, requiring some understanding of historical spread patterns. The completeness is partial as it mentions some regions but not the full scope or mechanisms of spread. The correctness is adequate but lacks precision in detailing the spread's origins and vectors. Fluency in the response is natural for a non-native speaker, and the quality of Portuguese is good with minor potential improvements for accuracy."
