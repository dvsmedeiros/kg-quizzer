  "pergunta": "What are the main principles of the IPCC's approach to climate change?",
  "resposta": "The main principles involve synthesizing, securing knowledge, and collaboration on global issues. The IPCC uses scientific achievements, established organizations, and global knowswlede to identify, monitor, and cooperate on climas Globais.",
  "complexidade": 3,
  "completude": 2,
  "corretude": 3,
  "fluidez": 2,
  "qualidade_portugues": 2,
  "justificativa": "The complexity is medium as it requires understanding the IPCC's role beyond simple facts. Completeness is partial because key aspects such as specific methodologies and the focus on mitigation strategies are missing. Correctness is fair, with minor inaccuracies and a misspelling ('knowswlede'). Fluency is somewhat artificial due to awkward phrasing and misspelling. The quality of Portuguese is acceptable but contains errors such as 'climas Globais' which should be 'mudanças climáticas globais'."
