  "qualidade_portugues": 2,
  "justificativa": "The complexity is medium as it requires understanding the role of the IPCC beyond mere facts. The completeness is partial because while it mentions synthesis and dissemination, it lacks details about specific impacts and policy influences. The correctness is acceptable but includes a typo ('knowswlede') and could be more precise. Fluency is somewhat artificial due to phrasing and the typo. The quality of Portuguese is fair, with some errors and non-native phrasing."
