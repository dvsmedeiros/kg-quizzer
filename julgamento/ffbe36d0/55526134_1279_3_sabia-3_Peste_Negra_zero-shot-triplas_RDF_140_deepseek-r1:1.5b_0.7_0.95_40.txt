The response is almost fully complete, addressing the main cause but could be more detailed about specific environmental factors. It is mostly correct and coherent with the context provided. The fluency is good, but the translation to Portuguese would benefit from smoother phrasing and better grammatical adjustments. The quality of Portuguese is acceptable, with some minor translation issues."
