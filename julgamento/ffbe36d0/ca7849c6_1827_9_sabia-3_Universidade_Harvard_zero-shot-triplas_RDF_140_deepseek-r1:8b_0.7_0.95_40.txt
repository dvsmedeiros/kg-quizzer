  "qualidade_portugues": 5,
  "justificativa": "The question and answer are valid and require some context understanding, but the answer is somewhat incomplete as it does not elaborate on the specific contributions made by Melanie Joy to global education. The correctness is high, assuming Melanie Joy's impacts are well-recognized in the field. The fluency and quality of Portuguese are not applicable here since the response is in English, but the text is clear and well-structured."
