  "justificativa": "The question requires understanding the geological process of rock formation beneath the Earth's surface, which is of medium complexity. The answer is complete, accurate, and directly addresses the question. The fluidity and naturalness of both the question and the answer are excellent, although the response is in English, it would be equally natural if translated to Portuguese. The quality of Portuguese in this case is assessed based on the translation, which would be largely correct with only minor potential translation nuances."
