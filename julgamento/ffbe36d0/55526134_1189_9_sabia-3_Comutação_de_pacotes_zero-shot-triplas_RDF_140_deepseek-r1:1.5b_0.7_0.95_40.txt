  "justificativa": "The pair requires understanding of the context of internet history and specific protocols, hence medium complexity. The response is adequate but lacks detail, making it only moderately complete. It is mostly correct but could benefit from specifying the role of X.25 more clearly. The fluidity is good for English, but for Portuguese, it would need translation and slight adjustment for natural phrasing, resulting in a few minor errors."
