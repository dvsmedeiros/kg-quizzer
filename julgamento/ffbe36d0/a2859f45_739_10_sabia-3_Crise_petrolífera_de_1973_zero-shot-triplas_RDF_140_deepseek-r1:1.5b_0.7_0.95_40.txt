  "justificativa": "The pair requires minimal understanding and inference, mostly factual recall. The answer is somewhat complete but lacks specific details on why these countries were less affected. It is partially correct as it mentions some nations but omits others that might not have been targeted by the embargo. The fluency is good for a native English speaker but slightly off for a Portuguese context, and the translation quality is acceptable with minor issues."
