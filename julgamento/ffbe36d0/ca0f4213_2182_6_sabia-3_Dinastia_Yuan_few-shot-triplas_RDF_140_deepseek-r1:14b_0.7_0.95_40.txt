  "justificativa": "The pair is moderately complex, as it requires knowledge of historical events related to the Yuan dynasty. The completeness is nearly total, as it specifies a significant battle and the year, though it could have provided a brief context. The correctness is accurate and precise. Fluency is good but not perfect, as the translation to Portuguese could be more natural. The quality of Portuguese is acceptable with minor translation issues."
