  "pergunta": "What bonds does oxygen form to other atoms?",
  "resposta": "Oxygen forms double covalent bonds with nitrogen, carbon, sulfur, and halogens. These bonds are crucial for the stability of molecules like water (H2O) and ozone (O3).",

  "justificativa": "The question and answer require understanding of chemical bonding beyond simple memorization, hence medium complexity. The answer is nearly complete but could benefit from mentioning specific examples of such bonds beyond water and ozone. The correctness is high but lacks mention of single or triple bonds in certain cases. Fluency is good but slightly artificial due to the formal tone. The Portuguese translation would benefit from a more natural phrasing to achieve fluency and correctness."
