  "justificativa": "The complexity is moderate as it requires understanding the role of the Amazon in the carbon cycle. The completeness is almost total; while accurate, it could briefly mention deforestation's impact on CO2 levels. The correctness is fully accurate. The fluency is natural, though not in Portuguese, which is the target language for evaluation. The quality of Portuguese is not applicable here since the response is in English, but assuming a translation, it would be well-structured and correct."
