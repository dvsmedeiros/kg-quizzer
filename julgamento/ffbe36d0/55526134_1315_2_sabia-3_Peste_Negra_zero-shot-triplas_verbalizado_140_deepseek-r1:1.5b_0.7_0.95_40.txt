  "justificativa": "The pair is moderately complex as it requires understanding the role of Yersinia pestis in the transmission of bubonic plague. The completeness is adequate, though it could be more detailed about how the bacterium is transmitted. The correctness is high, but lacks specificity about the vector role of fleas. Fluency in Portuguese is good, though the sentence could benefit from slight restructuring for natural flow. The quality of Portuguese is largely correct, with only minor adjustments needed for a more natural tone."
