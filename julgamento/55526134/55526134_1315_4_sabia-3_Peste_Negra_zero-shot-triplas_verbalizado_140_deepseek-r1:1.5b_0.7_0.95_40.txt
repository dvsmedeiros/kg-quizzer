  "qualidade_portugues": 4,
  "justificativa": "The complexity is low as it requires basic knowledge of the disease symptoms. The completeness is partial because the response does not detail specific symptoms like buboes, fever, or rash. The correctness is acceptable but could be improved with more precise medical details. The fluency in Portuguese is good, though the sentence could be more informative. The quality of Portuguese is high with no major grammatical errors."
