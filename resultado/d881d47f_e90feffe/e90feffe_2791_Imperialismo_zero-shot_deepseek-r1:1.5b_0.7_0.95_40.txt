Okay, so I need to create these 10 objective questions in Portuguese about imperialism based on the context provided. Let me start by understanding what's given.

First, there's a block of text that starts with "Imperialismo" and mentions something about it being a long-standing term. That sounds like a good starting point for one of my questions. Maybe I can ask someone about how imperialism is remembered or supported.

Next, the text talks about the history of the English Language and its connection to imperialism, mentioning that some people consider English as a foreign language. That's another good question: "Do you think English is considered a foreign language by people familiar with the English Language?" It directly relates to the context provided.

Then there's information about how empires were involved in world events and how countries often use imperial ties for their interests. This seems relevant for asking someone about why some countries depended on empires, like China or Russia. So maybe: "Why do you think some countries rely heavily on empires as part of their economic or political system?" 

Moving on, the text mentions how empires contributed to world events but also mentioned that they might even try to influence politics. That's a good point for an objective question about whether imperialism was neutral. So: "Do you believe empires played a neutral role in influencing the political landscape of their time?"

Looking at the data on empires' sizes and their connection to culture, this is another area where people might discuss how imperial expansion affected regions. So perhaps: "How do you think the size and impact of empires influenced cultural development or traditions within them?" 

The part about the English Language's relationship with imperialism could lead to a question about whether English was still used as an official language in some cases. Maybe: "Is English still commonly used as an official language today, even though it isn't widely recognized?"

The text also talks about how empires were seen as threats and factors in conflict. That's another point for an objective question about the dynamics of empire vs. other powers. So: "How do you see them as compared to other world powers in terms of challenges or advantages when considering conflicts?"

Lastly, the part about empires influencing politics could ask about how these influences were managed within political systems. Maybe: "How are you thinking they're used within a political system and how that affects their effectiveness?" 

I should make sure each question is clear, based on the context, and has a unique answer. I think this covers all the main points from the provided text without adding any extra information or comments.
