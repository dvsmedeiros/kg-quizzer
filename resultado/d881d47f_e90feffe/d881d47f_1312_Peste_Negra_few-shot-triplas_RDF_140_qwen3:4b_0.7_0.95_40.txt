Okay, the user wants me to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the provided context about the Black Death. Let me start by understanding the context thoroughly.

The Black Death, also known as the Great Plague, caused a massive death toll in Eurasia, with estimates between 75 to 200 million people. The main cause is Yersinia pestis, leading to bubonic, pneumonic, and septicemic plague. It originated in Central or Eastern Asia, spread via the Silk Road, and reached Europe through Genoese ships. It peaked in Europe between 1347-1351, killing 30-60% of Europe's population. The population of Europe took 200 years to recover, with some areas like Florence recovering in the 19th century. The plague returned as outbreaks until the early 20th century.

The user provided examples of questions and answers, so I need to ensure that my questions are varied and cover different aspects. Let me list out possible areas: origin, spread, cause, impact, historical effects, recovery time, etc.

First, origin: where did it start? The context says Central or Eastern Asia. Then, the spread path: via Silk Road, Genoese ships, etc. The cause is Yersinia pestis leading to different forms of plague. The impact: population decrease, economic and social effects. The time frame: when it peaked, when the population recovered. Also, the role of rats and fleas in transmission. The death toll numbers, both global and European. The duration of the pandemic, and the recurrence of outbreaks.

Now, I need to make sure each question is unique and covers different aspects. Let me check the examples again to avoid repetition. The user's examples include origin, spread, percentage of population, recovery time, duration, etc. So I should generate 10 unique questions based on these points.

Let me start drafting:

1. Origin of the Black Death: where?
2. How did the Black Death spread to Europe?
3. What was the main cause of the Black Death?
4. What percentage of Europe's population was affected?
5. How long did the Black Death last in Europe?
6. When did the population of Europe recover from the Black Death?
7. What was the estimated global population before and after the Black Death?
8. How was the Black Death transmitted?
9. What were the long-term effects of the Black Death on Europe?
10. How many people died from the Black Death globally?

Wait, the user's examples included some about the causes of the plague, the role of fleas, and the time frame. Let me ensure that each question is distinct. Also, check if the answers are accurate based on the context.

For example, the origin is Central or Eastern Asia. The spread was through the Silk Road and Genoese ships. The main cause is Yersinia pestis. The percentage is 30-60% of Europe. The duration in Europe was around 1347-1351. Recovery time for Europe was 200 years. The global population before was around 400 million, and after was around 300 million. Transmission via fleas on rats. Long-term effects include economic changes, labor shortages, social upheaval. Global deaths estimated 75-200 million.

I need to make sure that each of these points is covered in the questions. Let me check if the examples provided by the user included similar questions. The user's examples had questions about origin, spread, percentage, recovery time, duration, etc. So I need to avoid repeating those. Let me think of 10 unique ones.

Another point: the role of rats and fleas in transmission. Also, the different forms of plague. The fact that the plague returned as outbreaks. The impact on the economy, such as labor prices and social structures.

Okay, let me structure the 10 questions accordingly. Make sure each answer is based on the given context. Also, check that the answers are in the correct format, like numbers, dates, or specific terms.
