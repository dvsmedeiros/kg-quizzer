Ok, I need to create a CSV with 10 question-response pairs based on the given context and facts about Warsaw. Let me start by understanding what's provided.

First, the context is a detailed description of Warsaw, including its history, geography, economy, culture, and notable landmarks. The facts list specific information like births, deaths, locations of notable buildings or events in Warsaw.

I'll need to come up with 10 varied questions that cover different aspects of Warsaw. Each question should have only one correct answer, which can be explicitly or inferibly derived from the context.

Looking at the facts, there are mentions of people born or died in Warsaw, places located in Warsaw, events held there, and notable structures. I'll structure questions around these points.

I should ensure that each question is distinct and not repetitive. For example, one question could be about a person's birthplace, another about a specific event location, etc.

Now, going through the facts:

1. Stanisław Mazur died in Warsaw.
2. Władysław Zieliński was born in Warsaw.
3. Zygmunt Chmielewski died in Warsaw.
4. Sigismund's Column is located in Warsaw.
5. Ida Nowakowska was born in Warsaw.
6. Hubert Wagner 1 died in Warsaw.
7. Adolf Dygasiński died in Warsaw.
8. The 2014–15 Polish football season had a stadium in Warsaw.
9. Weronika Kordowiecka was born in Warsaw.
10. Ireneusz Sekuła died in Warsaw.

I'll craft questions around these facts, ensuring each is unique and clearly related to the context.

For example:
- Who was born in Warsaw? (Władysław Zieliński)
- What notable person died in Warsaw? (Stanisław Mazur)
- Where is Sigismund's Column located? (Warsaw)

I need to make sure that each question is phrased correctly and the answers are accurate based on the facts provided.

Also, I should format them as CSV with semicolons separating the questions and responses.
