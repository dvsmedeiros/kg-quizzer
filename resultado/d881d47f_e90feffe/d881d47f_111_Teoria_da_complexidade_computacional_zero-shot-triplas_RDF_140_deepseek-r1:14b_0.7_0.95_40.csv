pergunta;resposta
First, I'll read through the objective again. It says I should create 10 question-response pairs in CSV format, using only the given content. Each line should be "pergunta;resposta". The questions should vary and cover different aspects of the topic. Also, each must have a single correct answer that's either explicit or inferable from the context.
