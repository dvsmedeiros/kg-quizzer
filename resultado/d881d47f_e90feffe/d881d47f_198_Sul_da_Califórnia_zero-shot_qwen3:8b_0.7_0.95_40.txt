Okay, the user wants me to generate 10 CSV question-answer pairs based on the context "Sul_da_Califórnia". Let me start by understanding the context. The user mentioned "Sul_da_Califórnia" which translates to "Southern California" in English. I need to create questions in Portuguese that are varied and cover different aspects of Southern California.

First, I should recall key information about Southern California. It's a region in the United States, known for its cities like Los Angeles, San Diego, and Orange County. It's part of California, so the state capital is Sacramento, but the region's major cities are different. The climate is typically Mediterranean, with dry summers and wet winters. There's a significant population, and it's a major economic hub. The area is also known for its beaches, entertainment industry, and cultural diversity.

Now, I need to form 10 distinct questions. Let me brainstorm possible topics: geography, major cities, economy, climate, population, cultural aspects, landmarks, transportation, education, and notable industries. Each question should be unique and not repeat the same aspect.

1. What is the capital of the state that includes Southern California? Answer: Sacramento.
2. Which city is the most populous in Southern California? Answer: Los Angeles.
3. What is the typical climate of Southern California? Answer: Mediterranean.
4. What is the main economic activity in Southern California? Answer: Entertainment and technology.
5. Which ocean borders Southern California? Answer: Pacific Ocean.
6. What is a major transportation route in Southern California? Answer: Interstate Highway System.
7. Which university is located in Southern California and is renowned? Answer: University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA).
8. What is a notable natural feature in Southern California? Answer: San Diego's beaches.
9. Which famous landmark is located in Southern California? Answer: Hollywood Sign.
10. What is a significant cultural aspect of Southern California? Answer: Diversity of cultures.

Wait, I need to ensure that the answers are correct and directly inferred from the context. Let me double-check each answer. For example, the capital of California is indeed Sacramento, so that's correct. Los Angeles is the most populous city in the region. The Mediterranean climate is accurate. The economy includes entertainment and tech, which fits. The Pacific Ocean borders the region. The Interstate Highway System is a major transportation route. UCLA is a well-known university there. San Diego's beaches are a natural feature. The Hollywood Sign is a famous landmark. Cultural diversity is a key aspect. 

I need to make sure the questions are in Portuguese and the answers are concise. Also, check for any repetition in the questions. Each should cover a different aspect. I think this covers the required 10 questions without repetition. Now, format them as CSV pairs.
