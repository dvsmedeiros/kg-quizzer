Okay, the user wants me to generate 10 pairs of questions and answers in CSV format based on the context of Harvard University. Let me start by recalling the key points about Harvard. 

First, I need to make sure each question is unique and covers different aspects. Let me think about the main areas: founding year, location, notable programs, famous alumni, mascot, rankings, notable buildings, enrollment, Nobel laureates, and maybe something about its endowment.

Wait, the user mentioned the context is "Universidade_Harvard" so I should focus on that. Let me check each point:

1. When was Harvard founded? The answer is 1636. That's a basic fact.
2. Where is it located? Cambridge, Massachusetts. Important to specify the city and state.
3. What's the mascot? The Harvard Crimson. Need to confirm if that's correct.
4. Which is the oldest college? Harvard College, established in 1636. Wait, but Harvard University was founded in 1636, so maybe the answer is Harvard College.
5. What's the nickname? The Crimson. That's the team name.
6. What's the ranking? Top 5 in the US. But I should check if it's the same as the global ranking. Maybe say "top 5 in the US" to be accurate.
7. Notable building? The Harvard Law School. Or maybe the Widener Library? But the user might prefer the Law School as it's a major part.
8. Enrollment? Around 20,000. Need to check exact number, but 20,000 is a common figure.
9. Nobel laureates? Over 160. That's a known fact.
10. Endowment? Over $40 billion. Yes, that's correct.

Wait, I need to ensure each answer is directly from the context. Since the context is just "Universidade_Harvard", I have to rely on general knowledge. But the user might expect specific details. Let me verify each point again.

For the mascot, it's the Harvard Crimson, which is correct. The nickname is also Crimson. The oldest college is Harvard College. The ranking is top 5 in the US. The endowment is indeed over $40 billion. The enrollment is around 20,000. Nobel laureates over 160. The notable building could be the Harvard Law School or the Widener Library. Maybe the Law School is more prominent. 

I need to make sure the questions are varied and not repeating. Let me structure each question to cover different aspects: history, location, mascot, ranking, buildings, enrollment, alumni, awards, etc. 

Now, format them as CSV with semicolons. No markdown, just plain text. Check for 10 pairs, no duplicates. Alright, I think that's covered.
