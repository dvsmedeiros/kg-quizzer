Okay, I need to generate 10 CSV pairs of questions and answers based on the provided context and facts about Ctenophora. Let me start by understanding the context and the facts given.

The context describes Ctenophora as a phylum of marine animals, their characteristics like cilia for movement, bioluminescence, size range, and their relation to cnidarians. The facts include various tags, templates, categories, images, and specific details like the species Mnemiopsis leidyi, the etymology, and some classifications.

First, I should extract key information from the context and facts. The main points are:
- They are marine animals with cilia (pentes) for movement.
- They are bioluminescent.
- Size ranges from 1mm to 1.5m.
- Similar to jellyfish but not closely related.
- Present since the Cambrian period.
- Taxonomic details like being a phylum, species, and classifications.

Now, I need to form varied questions that cover different aspects. Let me check the examples provided to ensure the questions are similar in structure but cover different points. The examples include questions about what they are, how they move, size, characteristics, common names, etc.

Possible questions could be:
1. What is the common name for Ctenophora?
2. What is the primary method of locomotion for Ctenophora?
3. What is the size range of Ctenophora?
4. What is the etymology of the term Ctenophora?
5. What is the primary diet of Ctenophora?
6. What is the taxonomic classification of Ctenophora?
7. What is the significance of the Cambrian period in relation to Ctenophora?
8. What are the main features that distinguish Ctenophora from Cnidaria?
9. What is the role of bioluminescence in Ctenophora?
10. What is the primary structure used for feeding and respiration?

Wait, some of these might not be directly covered in the facts. Let me check the facts again. The facts mention bioluminescence, size, cilia for movement, relation to cnidarians, Cambrian presence, species like Mnemiopsis leidyi, and classifications. 

I need to ensure each question is based on the given facts. For example, the fact that they use cilia for movement, their size range, common names like comb jellies, and their presence since the Cambrian. Also, the fact that they are not closely related to Cnidaria despite similarities.

So, possible questions:
1. What is the common name for Ctenophora?
2. What is the primary method of locomotion for Ctenophora?
3. What is the size range of Ctenophora?
4. What is the etymology of the term Ctenophora?
5. What is the taxonomic classification of Ctenophora?
6. What is the significance of the Cambrian period in the history of Ctenophora?
7. What distinguishes Ctenophora from Cnidaria?
8. What is the role of bioluminescence in Ctenophora?
9. What is the primary structure used for feeding and respiration?
10. What is the species-typical example of Ctenophora?

Now, I need to verify if these questions are covered in the facts. For example, the etymology is mentioned as "do grego: κτείς kteis 'pente' e φέρω pherō 'portador'". The size range is given as 1 mm to 1.5m. The common name is "carambolas-do-mar" or "águas-vivas-de-pente". The taxonomic classification includes being a phylum, species like Mnemiopsis leidyi, and categories like Animal. The Cambrian period is mentioned as present since the Cambriano. The distinction from Cnidaria is about convergência evolutiva. Bioluminescence is a characteristic. Feeding and respiration involve the cavity through which water flows.

I need to make sure each question has a unique answer and is based on the given facts. Also, avoid repeating similar questions. Let's structure the CSV pairs accordingly.
