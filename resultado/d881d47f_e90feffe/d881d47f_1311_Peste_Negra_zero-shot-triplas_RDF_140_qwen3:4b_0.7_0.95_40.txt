Okay, I need to generate 10 pairs of questions and answers based on the provided context about the Black Death. Let me start by reading through the context carefully to make sure I understand all the key points.

The context mentions that the Black Death was a pandemic that killed 75 to 200 million people in Eurasia, peaking in Europe between 1347 and 1351. The causative agent is Yersinia pestis, leading to different forms of plague like bubonic, septicemic, and pneumonic. It originated in Central or Eastern Asia, spread via the Silk Road, and reached Crimea by 1343. It was transported by fleas on rats on Genoese merchant ships, spreading through the Mediterranean to Europe. It killed 30-60% of Europe's population, reducing the world population from 475 million to 350-375 million in the 14th century. Europe took 200 years to recover, with some regions like Florence recovering in the 19th century. The plague had several outbreaks until the early 20th century.

Now, I need to create questions that cover different aspects. Let me think of possible angles: origin, cause, forms, spread, impact, historical effects, statistics, transmission, recovery, and the role of the Silk Road. I need to ensure each question is unique and based on the given facts.

First question: Origin of the Black Death. Answer is Asia Central or Eastern Asia.

Second: Causative agent. Answer is Yersinia pestis.

Third: Forms of plague. Bubonic is the most common, so that's the answer.

Fourth: Transmission method. Fleas on rats via Genoese ships.

Fifth: Death toll in Europe. 30-60% of population.

Sixth: World population reduction. From 475M to 350-375M.

Seventh: Recovery time for Europe. 200 years.

Eighth: Specific region's recovery. Florence in the 19th century.

Ninth: Spread path. From Asia via Silk Road to Crimea, then to Mediterranean and Europe.

Tenth: Historical effects. Social, religious, economic convulsions.

Wait, I need to make sure each answer is directly from the context. Let me check each answer against the provided text again. For example, the origin is in Asia Central or Eastern Asia. The answer for the forms is bubonic. Transmission via fleas on rats on Genoese ships. Death toll in Europe is 30-60%. World population reduction is 475M to 350-375M. Recovery time for Europe is 200 years. Florence's recovery is 19th century. Spread path is via Silk Road to Crimea, then Mediterranean. Historical effects include social, religious, economic issues.

I think that's all. Now, structure each question to be clear and based on the facts. Make sure the answers are correct and directly from the context. No need to add extra info. Just 10 pairs.
