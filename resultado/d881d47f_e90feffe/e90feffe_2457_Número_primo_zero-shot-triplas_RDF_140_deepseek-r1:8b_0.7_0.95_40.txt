Okay, so I need to come up with 10 questions and answers related to prime numbers based on the given information. Let me start by understanding what the user provided.

First, there's a lot of RDF data about prime numbers. It includes various primes like 2, 3, 5, etc., and mentions that each of them has a factorization into prime numbers. There are also some people mentioned, like Heinrich Scherk and Landon Curt Noll, who are known for their work in prime numbers.

I remember that prime numbers are numbers greater than 1 that have no divisors other than 1 and themselves. The first few primes are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, etc. So maybe I can start by creating questions about the definition and properties of primes.

Looking at the data, I see that primes like 11, 127, 131, 137, and others are mentioned as having factorizations into prime numbers. This likely means they're all primes themselves.

I should structure each question to be clear and directly related to a fact from the provided data. For example, one question could ask what makes a number a prime, another might list some small primes, and so on.

Let me think about possible questions:

1. What is a prime number?
2. Are all small numbers like 2, 3, 5 considered prime?
3. Can even numbers be prime? (Yes, only 2)
4. What is the smallest prime number?
5. List some prime numbers.
6. How many primes are there below 100?
7. Is 1 a prime number? (No)
8. What do prime numbers have in their factorizations? (Only themselves)
9. Are composite numbers not prime? (Yes)
10. Who is known for discovering or working on primes?

Wait, the data mentions that Scherk and Noll are known for prime numbers. So maybe question 10 could be about them.

But I need to ensure each answer is accurate based on what's provided. Since the data doesn't specify when these primes were discovered, but mentions Scherk and Noll, perhaps the last question can focus on them as notable figures in prime research.

I should also make sure the questions cover various aspects: definition, properties, examples, historical context, etc.

Let me try to formulate each pair:

1. What is a prime number? - A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.
2. Is 2 considered a prime number? - Yes, 2 is the smallest and only even prime number.
3. Are all odd numbers prime? - No, because many odd numbers are divisible by others (like 9, which is 3x3).
4. What is the largest known prime? - The data doesn't specify, but it's a known unknown, so I can say that as of now, it's unknown.
5. List some small prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, etc.
6. How many primes exist below 100? - There are 25.
7. Is 1 considered a prime number? - No, because it only has one divisor.
8. What is the role of prime factorization? - It breaks numbers into their prime components.
9. Can composite numbers be prime? - No, composites have factors other than 1 and themselves.
10. Who has contributed significantly to prime research? - Heinrich Scherk and Landon Curt Noll.

I think these cover a range of topics related to primes. I need to make sure the answers are concise and accurate based on the provided data or general knowledge, which seems acceptable here.

Here is a set of 10 questions and answers about prime numbers, thoughtfully curated from both the provided data and general knowledge:

1. **What is a prime number?**  
   - A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.

2. **Is 2 considered a prime number?**  
   - Yes, 2 is the smallest and only even prime number.

3. **Are all odd numbers prime?**  
   - No, because many odd numbers are divisible by others (like 9, which is 3x3).

4. **What is the largest known prime?**  
   - As of current knowledge, it remains unknown if there is a largest prime number.

5. **List some small prime numbers.**  
   - Small prime numbers include: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and so on.

6. **How many primes exist below 100?**  
   - There are 25 prime numbers below 100.

7. **Is 1 considered a prime number?**  
   - No, because 1 only has one divisor.

8. **What is the role of prime factorization?**  
   - Prime factorization breaks down numbers into their prime components, showing which primes multiply to give the original number.

9. **Can composite numbers be prime?**  
   - No, composite numbers have factors other than 1 and themselves, making them non-prime.

10. **Who has contributed significantly to prime research?**  
    - Notable figures include Heinrich Scherk and Landon Curt Noll, who have made contributions in the field of prime numbers.

This set of questions and answers covers a broad range of topics related to prime numbers, from their definition and properties to historical contributions.
