Okay, I need to generate 10 multiple-choice questions and correct answers based on the provided context about Sky_UK. The questions should be varied, cover different aspects of the content, and each must have a single correct answer that's either explicit or can be inferred.

First, I'll review the context given. It includes information about Sky_UK, such as its founding in 1991 by James Dyson, their focus on electric vehicles, investments in new technologies like solid-state batteries, collaborations with universities for R&D, and a commitment to sustainability with a target of net-zero emissions by 2030.

I'll brainstorm questions covering different aspects:

1. Founding Year: When was Sky_UK founded?
2. Founder: Who is the founder of Sky_UK?
3. Focus Area: What is Sky_UK primarily known for?
4. Technology Investment: Which technology does Sky_UK invest in?
5. Sustainability Goal: What is Sky_UK's sustainability target?

Next, I'll consider other areas:

6. R&D Collaboration: Which type of collaboration does Sky_UK have with universities?
7. Employee Focus: What does Sky_UK focus on regarding its employees?
8. Emission Target: What is Sky_UK's emission target year?

For the remaining questions, I can explore specific products or partnerships:

9. Product Name: What is a notable product from Sky_UK?
10. Partnership Example: Who has Sky_UK partnered with for technology development?

Now, I'll ensure each question has a clear correct answer based on the context. For example, the founder is James Dyson, so that's straightforward.

I also need to make sure not to repeat similar questions and cover various aspects like founding details, focus areas, investments, collaborations, sustainability, employee focus, emission targets, product names, and partnerships.

Finally, I'll structure each question and answer in the specified CSV format with semicolons as separators.
