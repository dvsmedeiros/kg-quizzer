Alright, I need to generate exactly 10 pairs of questions and answers in CSV format based on the provided context about civil disobedience. The user has given specific instructions, so I should follow them closely.

First, I'll review the context. It explains that civil disobedience is a peaceful form of political protest against unjust orders or oppressive governments. It was originally formulated by Henry David Thoreau and successfully used by Gandhi and Martin Luther King Jr. Additionally, there's a list of events and movements that employed civil disobedience, each linked via RDF triples.

I need to create varied questions covering different aspects of the content. Each question should have one correct answer derived from the context. I'll avoid repeating similar questions and ensure each is unique.

Looking at the facts provided, many are specific events where civil disobedience was used. For example, the 2015 Montenegrin crisis or the Iranian protests against compulsory hijab. These can form the basis of factual questions about which events involved civil disobedience.

Other aspects to cover might include key figures associated with civil disobedience, like Thoreau, Gandhi, and MLK, as well as the purpose and examples of its application.

I should structure each question to target different dimensions: causes, effects, key figures, historical applications, etc. This will ensure variety and comprehensive coverage.

Let me list potential questions:

1. Who formulated the concept of civil disobedience?
2. Which movement used it successfully for Indian independence?
3. What was Gandhi's approach called in India?
4. Which 20th-century figure applied Thoreau's ideas in the U.S.?
5. Name a recent protest in Poland using civil disobedience.
6. What were the Kazakh protests of 2022 about?
7. Which group protested against fees and cuts in higher education?
8. What was Gandhi's philosophy towards resistance?
9. In which country did the 'Refuse Fascism' movement occur?
10. What is a common method used in civil disobedience?

Now, I'll ensure each answer is correct based on the context. For example, Henry David Thoreau formulated it, Gandhi led the Indian movement, etc.

I should double-check that each question is clear and only has one correct answer as per the provided data. Also, avoid any overlap or similarity between questions to meet the user's requirements.
