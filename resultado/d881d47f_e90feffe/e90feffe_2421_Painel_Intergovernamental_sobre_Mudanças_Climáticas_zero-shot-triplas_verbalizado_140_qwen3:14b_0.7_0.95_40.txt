Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs based on the given context and facts. Let's start by reviewing the context and the facts provided.

The context is about the IPCC, its creation in 1988 by UNEP and WMO, its purpose, and some details about its reports and Nobel Prize. The facts include various attributes like the full name, type, location, models used, leaders, and other related information.

First, I'll list out key points from the context that can be turned into questions. For example, the creation year, the organizations that founded it, the purpose, the Nobel Prize, number of reports, etc. Then, from the facts, I can take details like the leader (Hoesung Lee), the location (Geneva, Switzerland), the models used (Template:IPCC), and other specific information.

I need to ensure that each question is unique and covers different aspects. Let me check for duplicates. For example, the full name in Portuguese and English is mentioned in the context, so a question about that would be good. The Nobel Prize in 2007 is another point. The number of reports (five) and their years (1990 to 2014) can be questions. The location in Geneva, the chairperson, the models used, the parent organizations (UNEP and WMO), and the fact that it doesn't produce original research but summarizes existing studies.

Now, I need to make sure each question is clear and the answers are directly from the context or facts. Let me structure each pair:

1. When was the IPCC created? Answer: 1988.
2. Which organizations founded the IPCC? Answer: PNUMA and OMM (UNEP and WMO in English).
3. What is the main purpose of the IPCC? Answer: Synthesize and disseminate knowledge on climate change.
4. What award did the IPCC receive in 2007? Answer: Nobel Peace Prize.
5. How many major reports has the IPCC produced? Answer: Five.
6. Where is the IPCC headquartered? Answer: Geneva, Switzerland.
7. Who is the current chair of the IPCC? Answer: Hoesung Lee.
8. What models are used in the IPCC's Wikipedia pages? Answer: Template:IPCC.
9. Which organizations are the parent bodies of the IPCC? Answer: UNEP and WMO.
10. Does the IPCC produce original research? Answer: No, it summarizes existing studies.

I should check if these are all covered in the context and facts. Yes, the context mentions the creation in 1988 by UNEP and WMO, the purpose, Nobel Prize, five reports, and Geneva as the headquarters. The facts add the chairperson, models used, and parent organizations. The answer about original research is in the context. That should cover 10 unique questions without repetition.
