Alright, I need to create 10 question-answer pairs based on the provided context about the Yuan dynasty. First, I'll read through the context carefully to understand the key points and details.

The Yuan dynasty began in 1271 under Kublai Khan, who was a Mongol general. It lasted until 1368 when it was dissolved. The dynasty is mentioned alongside several historical events like the Red Turban Rebellion and the Battle of Bakhchisaray. Key figures include Kublai Khan, Temür Khan, and Jenghis Khan. There are also mentions of places like Gansu, Xinjiang, and various battles.

I'll need to formulate questions that relate to these facts without being redundant. Each question should have a clear answer based on the context provided. I should ensure variety in topics such as the founder, key events, locations, leaders, and end dates.

Let me list possible questions:

1. When was the Yuan dynasty established?
2. Who founded the Yuan dynasty?
3. What key event marked the end of the Yuan dynasty?
4. Which leader's son became the founder of the Yuan dynasty?
5. In which year did Kublai Khan, the founder, die?
6. What significant battle was fought during the Yuan dynasty?
7. When was the Red Turban Rebellion?
8. Who was one of the leaders who supported Kublai Khan in Tibet?
9. Which city served as the capital of the Yuan dynasty?
10. In which year did the Yuan dynasty dissolve?

Now, I'll match each question with its correct answer based on the context provided.
