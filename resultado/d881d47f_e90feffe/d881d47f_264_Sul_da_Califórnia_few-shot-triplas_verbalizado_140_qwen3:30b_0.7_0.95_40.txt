Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs in Portuguese based on the provided context and facts about Southern California. Let me start by understanding the context and facts given.

The context says that Southern California (SoCal) is the third part of California, with no clear borders, defined by physical features. It mentions the Pacific Ocean to the west, the U.S.-Mexico border to the south, and Arizona to the east. The population in 2019 was about 23.8 million.

Now, looking at the facts, there are many entries about Southern California. I need to extract unique and varied questions from these. Let me go through the facts one by one and think of possible questions.

1. "Southern California possui área total (mi²) 56505" – Maybe a question about the total area.
2. "Southern California possui área total 146347.2781745357" – Wait, there are two different area numbers. Maybe a question about the area in square kilometers or the discrepancy?
3. "Southern California possui coordenada geográfica 34.0 -117.0" – Coordinates question.
4. "Southern California tem nome de subdivisão Ventura County, California" – Subdivisions.
5. "Southern California possui imagem representativa I-8 (CA).svg" – Maybe about the representative image.
6. "Tataviam language é falado em Southern California" – Languages spoken.
7. "Southern California é do tipo Place" – Type of entity.
8. "Southern California possui subdivisão Kern County, California" – Another subdivision.
9. "Southern California usa modelo de página wiki Template:Portal" – Wiki templates used.
10. "Southern California possui nome Southern California" – Redundant, maybe not useful.
11. "Southern California tem tipo de sede Largest city" – Sede type.
12. "Southern California possui assunto Category:Regions of California" – Subject category.
13. "Southern California possui imagem representativa Southern California Köppen.png" – Another image.
14. "Southern California população registrada em 2020" – Population in 2020.
15. "Southern California possui legenda da imagem Images top to bottom..." – Image legend.
16. "Southern California possui mapa (imagem) Southern California counties in red noshade.png" – Map image.
17. "Southern California é do tipo Location" – Entity type.
18. "Southern California é do tipo Location100027167" – Another entity type.
19. "Southern California possui tamanho do mapa 275" – Map size.
20. "Southern California usa modelo de página wiki Template:Col-begin" – Another wiki template.

I need to make sure the questions are varied and cover different aspects. Let me pick 10 unique ones.

1. What is the total area of Southern California in square miles? (From the first area fact)
2. What are the geographic coordinates of Southern California? (From the coordinates)
3. Which county is a subdivision of Southern California? (Multiple options, pick one)
4. What is the name of the representative image of Southern California? (From the I-8 image)
5. Which language is spoken in Southern California? (Tataviam)
6. What type of entity is Southern California classified as? (Place)
7. What is the population of Southern California according to the 2020 data? (Though the context says 2019, the fact mentions 2020)
8. What wiki template is used for Southern California? (Template:Portal)
9. What is the type of sede (headquarters) for Southern California? (Largest city)
10. What is the name of the map image representing Southern California? (Southern California counties in red noshade.png)

Wait, some of these might not be directly in the facts. Let me check again.

For the population, the context says 2019 was 23.8 million, but the fact says "população registrada em 2020". So the answer could be 23.8 million, but the fact mentions 2020. Maybe the question is about the population in 2020, but the context has 2019. Hmm, but the fact says "população registrada em 2020", so maybe the answer is that it's registered in 2020, but the exact number isn't given. Wait, the fact just says "população registrada em 2020" which translates to "population registered in 2020", but the exact number isn't provided. So maybe that's not a good question. Let me think of another.

Maybe instead of population, use the image legend. The fact says "legenda da imagem Images top to bottom..." so the answer would be that legend. But the question would be "What is the legend of the image representing Southern California?" The answer would be the list of places.

Another idea: "What is the total area of Southern California in square kilometers?" But the facts have two different numbers: 56505 mi² and 146347.2781745357. Wait, maybe the second one is in square kilometers? Let me check. 1 square mile is about 2.58999 square kilometers. So 56505 mi² * 2.58999 ≈ 146,347 km², which matches the second number. So the question could be "What is the total area of Southern California in square kilometers?" Answer: 146347.2781745357.

Another fact: "Southern California possui tamanho do mapa 275" – "Map size 275". Maybe the question is "What is the size of the map representing Southern California?" Answer: 275.

So compiling all that, here are 10 questions:

1. Qual é a área total de Southern California em milhas quadradas? (56505)
2. Quais são as coordenadas geográficas de Southern California? (34.0 -117.0)
3. Qual é um exemplo de subdivisão de Southern California? (Ventura County, California)
4. Qual é a imagem representativa de Southern California? (I-8 (CA).svg)
5. Qual língua é falada em Southern California? (Tataviam)
6. Como é classificado Southern California em termos de entidade? (Place)
7. Qual é o tamanho do mapa representativo de Southern California? (275)
8. Qual é o modelo de página wiki usado para Southern California? (Template:Portal)
9. Qual é o tipo de sede de Southern California? (Largest city)
10. Qual é a legenda da imagem representativa de Southern California? (Images top to bottom, left to right: Downtown Los Angeles, San Diego Skyline, Village of La Jolla, Santa Monica Pier, Surfer at Black's Beach, Hollywood Sign, Disneyland, Hermosa Beach Pier)

I need to make sure the answers are exactly as per the facts. For example, the image names are specific, like "I-8 (CA).svg" and "Southern California counties in red noshade.png". Also, the answer for the legend is the exact text provided in the fact.

I think that's 10 questions. Let me check if they are all unique and cover different aspects. Yes, each covers area, coordinates, subdivisions, images, languages, entity type, map size, wiki templates, headquarters type, and image legend. That should work.
