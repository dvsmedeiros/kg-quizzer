Okay, I need to generate 10 multiple-choice questions and answers based on the provided context about schools. The user wants these in CSV format with each line containing a question and the correct answer separated by a semicolon.

First, I'll review the context given: "Escola." Since it's in Portuguese, I should create questions in Portuguese as well. The topics to cover include different aspects of school such as subjects taught, school components, activities, and famous school-related quotes or sayings.

I should ensure each question is unique and covers various angles. For example, one about what schools teach, another about a typical school item, and so on. I also need to make sure the answers are explicitly stated or can be reasonably inferred from common knowledge related to schools.

Let me list out potential questions:

1. What do schools primarily focus on teaching? (Português)
2. Which part of the school is essential for learning?
3. What activity takes place during breaks?
4. Who is a person in charge of students' education and guidance?
5. What's an important phrase about education.
6. Where do you keep your books at school?
7. A tool used to write.
8. An item kept in backpacks for snacks.
9. An area where sports activities occur.
10. What schools are known for teaching.

Now, I'll translate these into Portuguese and find the correct answers based on typical school-related knowledge.
