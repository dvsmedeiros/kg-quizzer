Okay, so I have this task where I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs based on some given data about construction companies and related terms from DBpedia. The user has already provided an example of what they expect, with questions like "Which company specializes in..." followed by a specific term, and the answer being the name of the company.

First, I'll look through the data to identify possible connections between companies and their areas of specialization. For instance, some entries mention services or industries related to construction, like steel, railways, mechanical plastics, etc.

I need to make sure each question is clear and directly relates to a specific term mentioned in the data. Also, the answers should be concise, just listing the company names without additional information.

Let me go through the list and pick out 10 such connections. I'll start by noting down companies paired with their respective terms. For example, "ROKO Construction Company" is associated with construction industry, so a question could ask which company specializes in that area.

I have to ensure variety in the questions to cover different aspects of construction, like steel, railways, mechanical plastics, etc., to show a range of expertise areas.

After selecting 10 pairs, I'll structure them as per the example: each pair on a new line with question and answer separated by a semicolon. Finally, I'll present this list using the specified format with code blocks.
