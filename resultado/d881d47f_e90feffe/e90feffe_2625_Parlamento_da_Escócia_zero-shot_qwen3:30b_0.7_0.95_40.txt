Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the context "Parlamento_da_Escócia". Let me start by recalling what I know about the Scottish Parliament. 

First, I should make sure the questions are varied and cover different aspects. Let me think of possible topics: establishment date, structure, members, powers, notable events, etc.

1. When was the Scottish Parliament established? The answer is 1999, but I should check if that's correct. Yes, it was re-established in 1999 after being suspended in 1707.
2. How many members does it have? The answer is 129, divided into constituencies and regions.
3. What is the term of office for MSPs? It's 4 years, as per the Electoral Reform Act 2002.
4. What are the two chambers? The Scottish Parliament is a single chamber, but maybe the question is about the UK Parliament? Wait, the context is only about the Scottish Parliament. So maybe the question is about the committees or the role of the Parliament. Maybe the answer is that it has a single chamber.
5. Who is the head of the Scottish Government? The First Minister, currently John Swinney.
6. What is the main purpose of the Scottish Parliament? To legislate on devolved matters like health, education, etc.
7. How are the additional members elected? Through a proportional representation system.
8. What is the name of the building where it meets? The Scottish Parliament Building in Edinburgh.
9. What are the main devolved areas? Health, education, justice, etc.
10. What is the role of the Scottish Parliament in the UK? It has powers over devolved matters, while reserved matters are handled by the UK Parliament.

Wait, I need to make sure all answers are directly from the context. Since the context provided is just "Parlamento_da_Escócia", maybe I need to assume standard knowledge. But the user might expect specific details. Let me verify each point.

For example, the number of members: 129 (73 constituency, 56 regional). The term is 4 years. The building is in Edinburgh. The First Minister is the head. The Parliament has legislative power on devolved matters. The electoral system uses a mixed member proportional system. The Parliament is part of the UK but has its own powers.

I should structure each question to be clear and answerable with the given context. Avoid repetition. Check for variations in aspects like structure, functions, history, members, etc.
