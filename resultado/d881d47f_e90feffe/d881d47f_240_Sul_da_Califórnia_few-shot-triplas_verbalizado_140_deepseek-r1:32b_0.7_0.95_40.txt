Okay, I need to generate 10 question and answer pairs based on the provided context about Southern California. Let's start by understanding what information is available.

The main points from the context include:
- The region is informally known as Southern California or SoCal.
- It doesn't have exact boundaries but uses physical features like the Pacific Ocean to the west, Mexico border to the south, and Arizona to the east.
- Population was around 23.8 million in 2019.

Looking at the facts provided, there are mentions of various organizations, places, people, and events associated with Southern California. I need to create varied questions that cover different aspects without repeating similar ones.

First, I can ask about the abbreviation, which is straightforward from the context: SoCal.

Next, considering the physical boundaries, a question about what lies to the west would be appropriate. The answer is the Pacific Ocean.

The population figure given is for 2019, so a question about that makes sense.

Since Southern California includes several counties, asking how many and naming them could work, but I need to ensure it's concise. Alternatively, I can ask which county is part of it, like Kern County.

Looking at the list of facts, organizations like CIF Southern Section and California Avocado Society are based there. That leads to a question about what organization is headquartered in the region.

The context mentions earthquakes affecting Southern California, such as the 2014 La Habra earthquake. A question about a significant event makes sense.

The region includes major cities, so asking which large city is part of it could be answered with Los Angeles.

There are several museums listed, so a question about a museum based there would fit well.

Mexican-Americans and other ethnic groups have populations in Southern California, so asking about the largest group by ethnicity is relevant.

Finally, considering transportation infrastructure, highways like I-8 and others are mentioned. A question about highway routes could be answered with examples like I-8 and I-10.

I need to ensure each question is unique and covers different aspectsâ€”geography, population, organizations, cultural aspects, etc. Let me structure these into clear questions with accurate answers from the provided data.
