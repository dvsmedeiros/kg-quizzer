Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the provided context and facts. The context is about the Normans, their origins, and their historical impact. The facts are in RDF format, which includes various entities and their relationships.

First, I need to parse the context thoroughly. The key points are that the Normans were a Germanic people in northern France, descended from Vikings. They played significant roles in medieval Europe, including the Norman Conquest of England, Sicily, and the Crusades. Their history has generated many legends.

Looking at the facts, there's a lot of data about battles, places, and people associated with the Normans. For example, several battles like the Battle of Cerami and the Siege of Mahdia are listed. Also, there are mentions of architectural styles, families, and castles built by Normans. The RDF data also includes information about languages, religions, and other ethnic groups related to the Normans.

Now, I need to create varied questions that cover different aspects. The user specified not to repeat similar questions, so I have to ensure each question is unique. Possible angles include origins, historical events, cultural impact, related battles, and specific facts from the RDF data.

For example, one question could be about the origin of the term "Norman," which the context mentions as coming from "Northmen" or "Norsemen." Another could be about the regions they colonized, like Normandy and Sicily. The battles listed in the facts can be used for questions on specific conflicts they were involved in. Also, the languages they spoke (Old Norman, Old Norse) and their religious affiliations (Christianity and Norse paganism) are points to consider.

I need to make sure each answer is directly supported by the context or the facts. For instance, the answer to a question about the origin of the term "Norman" is clearly stated in the context. Similarly, the battles they participated in are listed in the RDF data.

I also need to avoid any questions that might have multiple correct answers unless the context explicitly states that. For example, the question about the languages they spoke can be answered with the information from the RDF data.

Finally, I'll format the answers correctly in CSV, ensuring each question and answer pair is separated by a semicolon and the entire list is in Portuguese. I'll check for duplicates and ensure the questions cover different aspects of the Normans' history and culture.
