Okay, let's tackle this. The user provided a bunch of triples with schools and their type as private. They want me to generate 10 question-answer pairs based on these. The instructions say each pair should be in Portuguese, the question must be about the type of institution, and the answer should be "Private school" using the data from the triples.

First, I need to go through the list and pick 10 different schools. Let me scan the list. There are a lot here. Let me start selecting some.
