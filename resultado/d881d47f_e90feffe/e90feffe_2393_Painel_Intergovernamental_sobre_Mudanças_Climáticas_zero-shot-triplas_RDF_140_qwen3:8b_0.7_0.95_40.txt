Okay, I need to generate 10 CSV pairs of questions and answers based on the provided context about the IPCC. Let me start by understanding the context thoroughly. The IPCC is an intergovernmental organization established in 1988 by the UN, specifically by the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). Its main goal is to assess scientific information about climate change, providing summaries for policymakers. It doesn't conduct original research but synthesizes existing scientific knowledge. The IPCC has produced five major reports and some other documents, with the first in 1990 and the last in 2014. It was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2007.

Now, the facts provided include some RDF data, which mentions individuals associated with the IPCC, like Bert Bolin, Filippo Giorgi, and others. There's also information about the organization's headquarters in Geneva, its parent organizations (UNEP and WMO), and its abbreviation as IPCC. The key points are the founding year, purpose, structure, notable reports, and awards.

I need to create 10 varied questions. Let me brainstorm possible angles:

1. What is the full name of IPCC? (Answer: Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change)
2. When was the IPCC established? (1988)
3. Which organizations founded the IPCC? (UNEP and WMO)
4. What is the primary role of the IPCC? (Synthesize scientific knowledge on climate change)
5. What award did the IPCC receive in 2007? (Nobel Peace Prize)
6. What is the headquarters location of the IPCC? (Geneva, Switzerland)
7. What are the parent organizations of the IPCC? (UNEP and WMO)
8. When was the first IPCC report published? (1990)
9. What is the abbreviation for IPCC? (IPCC)
10. What is the main focus of the IPCC's work? (Climate change impacts, causes, risks, and mitigation)

Wait, need to ensure each question is distinct and covers different aspects. Let me check for repetition. The first question about the full name is covered. The second is the founding year. Third is the founding organizations. Fourth is the role. Fifth is the award. Sixth is the headquarters. Seventh is the parent organizations (same as third but phrased differently). Eighth is the first report year. Ninth is the abbreviation. Tenth is the main focus. Maybe adjust to avoid redundancy. For example, question 7 could be about the parent organizations, and question 3 about the founding organizations. Alternatively, maybe question 7 could be about the headquarters. Let me rephrase to ensure variety.

Also, need to ensure answers are directly from the context. For example, the answer to the first question is "Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change" (IPCC). The founding year is 1988. Parent organizations are UNEP and WMO. The primary role is synthesizing scientific knowledge. The award is Nobel Peace Prize in 2007. Headquarters in Geneva. First report in 1990. Abbreviation is IPCC. Main focus is climate change impacts, causes, risks, and mitigation. Maybe include the fact that it doesn't conduct original research. Let me check the context again.

The context mentions that the IPCC does not produce original research but summarizes existing knowledge. So maybe another question: Does the IPCC conduct original research? Answer: No. But I need 10 questions. Let me list all possible points and select 10.

Now, structuring the CSV pairs. Each question and answer must be in Portuguese, using semicolons. Let me verify each answer is accurate based on the context. For example, the first report was in 1990, last in 2014. The Nobel Prize was awarded in 2007. The headquarters is Geneva, Switzerland. Parent organizations are UNEP and WMO. The main role is to synthesize and disseminate knowledge. The abbreviation is IPCC. The organization is based in Geneva. The answer to the question about the main focus would be the causes, effects, risks, and mitigation strategies. Also, the IPCC is a consensus of leading scientists. 

I need to make sure each question is unique and covers different aspects. Let me proceed to create the 10 pairs accordingly.
