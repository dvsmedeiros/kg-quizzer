Okay, I need to generate 10 CSV pairs of questions and answers based on the provided context and facts. Let me start by understanding the context and the facts given.

The context talks about economic inequality, mentioning measures like the Gini coefficient, the Human Development Index adjusted for inequality, and how globalization affects inequality between and within countries. It also lists various concepts like equity, equality of results, and opportunities. The facts section includes a bunch of RDF triples, mostly about resources related to economic inequality, authors, movements, and studies.

First, I need to create varied questions that cover different aspects. Let me list possible areas: definitions, measures (Gini, HDI), effects of inequality, globalization's impact, related concepts (equity, equality), authors or studies, movements, and examples of resources.

Now, for each question, I need to ensure the answer is directly from the context. Let me check the facts again. For example, the Gini coefficient is mentioned as the most used measure. The HDI adjusted for inequality is another measure. Globalization reduced global inequality but increased within-country inequality. Concepts like equity, equality of results, and opportunities are mentioned. The Occupy movements are linked to economic inequality. Authors like Branko Milanović and Thomas Piketty are mentioned. The Land Reform Movement in China is cited as having economic inequality as a motive. The Coefficient of Gini is the main measure. The Index of Human Development Adjusted for Inequality is a composite index. The 1968 movement in Pakistan and other Occupy events are linked to economic inequality.

I should make sure each question is unique and covers different points. Let me draft the questions and answers now.

1. What is a common measure of economic inequality? Answer: Coefficient de Gini.
2. What index adjusts the Human Development Index for inequality? Answer: Índice de Desenvolvimento Humano Ajustado pela Desigualdade.
3. How does globalization affect inequality between and within countries? Answer: Reduziu a desigualdade global, mas aumentou a desigualdade dentro dos países.
4. What is a concept related to equal opportunities? Answer: Igualdade de oportunidades.
5. Which movement is associated with economic inequality? Answer: Occupy Wall Street.
6. What is a key factor in the Land Reform Movement in China? Answer: Desigualdade econômica.
7. Who is an economist associated with studying economic inequality? Answer: Branko Milanović.
8. What is a primary focus of the book "Capital in the Twenty-First Century"? Answer: Desigualdade econômica.
9. Which event is linked to economic inequality according to the facts? Answer: Movimento de 1968 na Paquistão.
10. What is the main measure for assessing income inequality? Answer: Coeficiente de Gini.

Wait, I need to check if all answers are directly from the context. For example, the Occupy movements are mentioned in the facts, so the answer for question 5 should be "Occupy Wall Street" or one of the listed Occupy events. The facts mention several Occupy events, but the answer should be specific. The user might expect "Occupy Wall Street" as the most known. Also, the Land Reform Movement in China is mentioned as having economic inequality as a motive, so question 6's answer is correct. The book "Capital in the Twenty-First Century" is linked to economic inequality. Branko Milanović is mentioned in the facts. The 1968 movement in Pakistan is linked to economic inequality. The Coefficient de Gini is the main measure. The HDI adjusted index is mentioned. Globalization's effect is covered. Concepts like equality of opportunities are mentioned. Okay, these should be valid.
