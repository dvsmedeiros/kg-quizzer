Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the provided context and facts about the Normans. First, I need to make sure I understand the context and the key points given.

The context mentions that Normans are a Germanic people from northern France, related to Vikings, and they had significant roles in medieval Europe. The facts include things like their religion (Norse paganism and Christianity), languages (Old Norse, Old Norman, Latin), architectural styles (Norman architecture), historical events (like the Norman Conquest of England), and various related terms and people.

Now, I need to create 10 distinct questions that cover different aspects. Let me list out possible topics: religion, languages, architecture, historical events, related groups, cultural aspects, etc. I should avoid repetition and ensure each question is unique.

Looking at the facts, there are mentions of different languages they spoke, so a question about that could be good. Also, their religious beliefs changed over time. The architectural styles they influenced, like Norman architecture in churches, is another area. Historical battles and events where they were involved. Their relation to other groups like the Jersey people, Gallo-Romans, etc. Also, their origin and migration.

I need to make sure each question is based on the given facts. For example, the Normans are related to Norse people, so a question about that. Also, the use of certain wiki templates, but maybe that's too technical. The user probably wants more general questions.

Let me start drafting:

1. What is the origin of the term "Normans"? Answer: Derived from "Northmen" or "Norsemen," meaning "men from the North."

2. What religion did the Normans initially follow? Answer: Norse paganism.

3. Which languages did the Normans speak? Answer: Old Norse and Old Norman.

4. What is the architectural style associated with Norman churches? Answer: Norman architecture.

5. Which historical event involved the Normans in the Mediterranean? Answer: The establishment of states in Sicily and southern Italy.

6. Who is an example of a person with Norman nationality? Answer: Richard of Salerno.

7. What is the relation between Normans and the Jersey people? Answer: Normans are related to the Jersey people.

8. What is the name of the battle where Normans were involved in the Mediterranean? Answer: The Battle of Cerami.

9. What is the main cultural influence of the Normans? Answer: Their role in medieval politics, military, and culture in Europe and the Mediterranean.

10. Which language did the Normans use in addition to Old Norse? Answer: Latin.

Wait, but the user wants 10 pairs. Let me check if these are all based on the facts provided. Also, need to ensure that the answers are directly from the given facts. For example, the answer about the Jersey people is in the facts. The Battle of Cerami is mentioned. The use of Latin is also in the facts. The main cultural influence is from the context. The answer about the origin of the term is correct. The answer about the languages includes Old Norse and Old Norman. The initial religion is Norse paganism. The architectural style is Norman architecture. The example of Richard of Salerno is correct. The relation to Jersey people is there. The other answer about the battle in the Mediterranean is the Battle of Cerami.

I think that's 10. Now, need to format them as per the CSV, making sure each line is "pergunta;resposta" without any markdown. Also, check for any possible overlaps or similar questions. For example, the question about the origin of the term is different from the one about the Jersey people. The answer about the languages is different from the one about the architectural style. Okay, this should work.
