Okay, so I need to create 10 question and answer pairs based on the given context about oxygen. Let me start by reading through the context carefully to pick out key facts.

First, the context mentions that oxygen was discovered by both Carl Wilhelm Scheele in 1773 and Joseph Priestley in 1774. But it's noted that Priestley is usually credited first because his work was published earlier. That makes a good question about who discovered oxygen.

Next, looking at the chemical properties, oxygen has an atomic number of 8. That's straightforward for another question.

The context also talks about Antoine Lavoisier coining the name "oxygen" in 1777. So that can be turned into a question about when the term was introduced.

Moving on to physical states, it's stated that liquid oxygen appears blue. That’s an interesting fact for a question about its color in different states.

Regarding the atmosphere, oxygen makes up about 20.8% by volume. This is essential for life and can be another question point.

The atomic structure of oxygen includes 8 protons and 8 electrons. That's fundamental chemistry knowledge, so it fits well as a question.

In terms of abundance, oxygen is the most abundant element in the Earth's crust, making up nearly half its mass. This fact can form a question about its prevalence on Earth.

The context also explains that ozone (O3) absorbs UV radiation but is harmful at ground level. That’s a good point for a question about ozone's role.

Another important use of oxygen is in rocket propulsion, as mentioned. This makes an excellent applied science question.

Lastly, the context notes that almost half of the human body's mass comes from oxygen, primarily through water content. That's a striking fact and can be another question.

I think these points cover various aspects of oxygen—its discovery, chemical properties, uses, atmospheric presence, and biological significance. Each question is unique and touches on different facets without repeating similar topics.
