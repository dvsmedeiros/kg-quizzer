Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the provided context and facts about British Satellite Broadcasting (BSB). Let me start by carefully reading through the context and the list of facts to ensure I cover different aspects without repeating similar questions.

First, the context mentions that BSB was incorporated in November 1990 to form BSkyB and started transmitting in March 1990. The facts include various categories, types, locations, related TV channels, and other details. I should make sure each question is unique and covers different aspects like founding year, location, related channels, types of entities, mergers, and other specific facts.

Looking at the examples given, they include questions about the company formed by the merger, the largest UK digital TV company, when BSkyB acquired Sky Italia, the holding company, and specific channels owned by BSB. I need to avoid repeating those and instead use the other facts provided.

I notice that BSB was founded in 1986, so a question about the founding year is possible. Also, it's located in London and Marco Polo House. There are several TV channels listed as properties of BSB, like The Movie Channel, The Power Station, Galaxy, Now, and The Computer Channel. Using these as examples for questions would be good.

Other facts include categories like Category:Sky Group, Type: Organisation, and it was merged with Sky Television to form BSkyB. Also, some films were produced by BSB, such as Hardware (film) and Memphis Belle. Additionally, BSB is part of the YagoLegalActorGeo and other types.

I need to ensure that each question is based on the facts provided. For example, "Qual é o ano de fundação da British Satellite Broadcasting?" would have the answer 1986. Another question could be about the location, like "Em que cidade a British Satellite Broadcasting está localizada?" with the answer London. 

There's also information about the merger with Sky Television, so a question about the merger result would be relevant. Also, the fact that BSB was succeeded by Sky UK. 

I should check that each answer is directly from the facts and not inferred beyond what's given. For example, the answer to a question about the company's type should be "Organisation" as per the facts. 

I need to make sure not to repeat the same type of question. For instance, there are multiple questions about TV channels, so I can pick different ones each time. Also, the fact that BSB is part of the Sky Group and the categories they belong to.

Let me list out possible questions:

1. Founding year of BSB.
2. Location of BSB.
3. Location of BSB's headquarters.
4. Year BSB was incorporated.
5. TV channels owned by BSB.
6. Merged company.
7. Succeeded by.
8. Type of entity.
9. Category related to the company.
10. Film produced by BSB.

I need to make sure each of these is covered and that the answers are correct based on the facts. Also, check for any possible overlaps or similar questions. Once I have these, I can structure them into the CSV format as specified.
