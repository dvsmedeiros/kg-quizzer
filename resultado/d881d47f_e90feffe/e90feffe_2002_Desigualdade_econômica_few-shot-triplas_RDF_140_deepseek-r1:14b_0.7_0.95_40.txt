Alright, I need to generate 10 pairs of questions and answers based on the provided context about economic inequality. The user has given me specific instructions, so let me go through them carefully.

First, I should understand the content. The context explains that economic inequality refers to the distribution of income and wealth among individuals or groups. It mentions different measures like the Gini Coefficient and the Human Development Index adjusted for inequality. It also discusses how globalization has reduced global inequality but increased it within countries.

Looking at the facts section, there are RDF triples linking various events, people, and works to economic inequality. For example, the 1968 movement in Pakistan is caused by economic inequality, and authors like Branko MilanoviÄ‡ and Mick Moore are interested in this topic.

The user provided examples of questions that focus on specific data points, such as percentages of wealth owned by certain groups or methodologies used by organizations. These examples suggest that the questions should be fact-based and extractable from the given content.

I need to create 10 unique questions covering different aspects of economic inequality. Each question should have one correct answer based on the context. I'll avoid repeating similar questions and ensure each is distinct in its focus.

Let me start by identifying key points from the context:
- Types of inequality: income, wealth.
- Measures: Gini Coefficient, Human Development Index.
- Effects of globalization: reduced global inequality but increased within countries.
- Authors and their works related to economic inequality (e.g., Piketty's books).
- Data points like percentages of wealth owned by top groups.

Now, I'll draft questions around these areas. Each question should be clear and have a direct answer from the context.

1. **Gini Coefficient**: Since it's mentioned as the most used measure, a question about its role makes sense.
2. **Human Development Index**: It's adjusted for inequality, so a question on that would fit.
3. **Globalization Impact**: The context states globalization reduced global inequality but increased within countries, which is a good point for a question.
4. **Wealth Distribution**: Specific percentages can be pulled from the examples, like 1% owning 40% of wealth.
5. **Richard Wilkinson's Work**: He's associated with academic discipline in economic inequality.
6. **Authors on Economic Inequality**: Mentioning Piketty and his work connects to the topic.
7. **Causes of Occupy Movements**: The RDF data links Occupy events to economic inequality, so a question about their cause fits.
8. **Billionaires' Wealth**: Using specific numbers from examples will make questions factual.
9. **Land Reform Movements**: Motives are linked to economic inequality in the facts.
10. **Academic Interest**: Scholars like Mick Moore show the academic focus on the topic.

I'll structure each question to target these points, ensuring variety and coverage of different aspects. The answers should directly reflect information from the context or examples provided.

Let me review each point to make sure I'm not missing any important details and that each question is clear and answerable based on the given content.
