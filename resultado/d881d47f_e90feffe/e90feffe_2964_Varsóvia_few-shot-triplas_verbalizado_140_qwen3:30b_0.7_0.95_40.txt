Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs based on the given context and facts about Warsaw. Let me start by carefully reading the context and the list of facts to identify key points.

First, the context mentions Warsaw as the capital of Poland, located on the Vistula River, with a population of 1.7 million in 2012. It has a rich history, including being a small fishing village, becoming the capital in 1569, and suffering during WWII. It's also known for its cultural landmarks like the Sigismund Column, the Royal Castle, and the Barbacan. The city is a major economic and cultural hub, with UNESCO recognition for its historic center. There's info about its classification as the 32nd most livable city in 2012 and other rankings.

Looking at the facts, there are various entries about people born or died in Warsaw, places located there, events, and other specifics. But I need to focus on the context provided, not the facts. Wait, the user said to generate questions based on the context and facts, but the examples used the context. Wait, the user's instruction says "based on context and facts provided." So I need to use both the context and the facts. But the facts are a long list of specific data points. However, the examples given in the prompt used the context, not the facts. But the user's instruction says to use both. Hmm, but the user also says "exclusivamente a partir do conteúdo fornecido" which is the context and facts. So I need to make sure the questions are based on either the context or the facts.

But the examples given in the prompt used the context. For instance, "Qual é a maior cidade da Polônia?" is answered by Varsóvia, which is in the context. The fact that "Varsóvia é a capital e maior cidade da Polónia" is in the context. So I need to make sure the questions are based on the context, not the facts. However, the user provided a list of facts that might include specific details not in the context. But since the user says "exclusivamente a partir do conteúdo fornecido," which includes both the context and the facts, I need to check if the facts can be used.

But the examples given by the user in the prompt (the "Exemplos") are based on the context. For example, "O que caracteriza a economia de Varsóvia?" is answered by "pla variedade de indústrias," which is in the context. So maybe the user wants the questions to be based on the context, not the facts. However, the user also provided a list of facts that might have specific data points. For example, "Warsaw possui dias de precipitação no ano 162.9" is a fact, but the context doesn't mention precipitation data. So I need to check if the facts are part of the content to use.

But the user's instruction says "baseado em contexto e fatos fornecidos." So I should use both. However, the examples in the prompt used the context. Maybe the facts are additional data points. But the user might have intended that the questions are based on the context, not the facts. However, the user included the facts as part of the content. So I need to use both.

But the problem is that some facts are very specific, like "Warsaw possui dias de precipitação no ano 162.9" which is a specific number. But the context doesn't mention that. So I need to decide whether to include such questions. However, the user's examples didn't use such specific numbers. For example, the example "Quantos moradores tem a maior área metropolitana?" is answered with "2.666 milhões," but the context says the population in 2012 was 1.7 million. So maybe the example is incorrect, but the user provided it as an example. However, the user's instruction is to generate based on the content provided. So I need to check if the facts are part of the content. 

Wait, the user provided the context and the facts as separate sections. The user says "baseado em contexto e fatos fornecidos." So both the context and the facts are part of the content. So I can use information from both. But the context is more general, and the facts are more specific. For example, the fact "Warsaw possui dias de precipitação no ano 162.9" is a specific data point that's not in the context. So I can create questions based on that. But the user's examples didn't use such specific data. However, the user's instruction says to generate based on the provided content, so I can use both.

But to ensure compliance, I need to make sure that the questions are based on the content provided. So I'll look through the context and facts to find 10 relevant points.

From the context:

- Capital of Poland, largest city.
- Located on the Vistula River.
- Population in 2012: 1.7 million.
- History: small fishing village, became capital in 1569, WWII destruction, UNESCO site.
- Cultural landmarks: Sigismund Column, Royal Castle, Barbacan.
- Economic and cultural hub, UNESCO recognition.
- Ranked 32nd most livable in 2012.
- "Semper invicta" as motto.
- "Varsovia" is the name in Polish.

From the facts:

- "Warsaw possui lema Semper invicta" (motto).
- "Warsaw possui assunto Category:Cities and towns in Masovian Voivodeship" (category).
- "Warsaw possui tipo WordNet synset-monument-noun-2" (type of synset).
- "Warsaw possui dias de precipitação no ano 162.9" (precipitation days).
- "Warsaw possui umidade relativa em setembro 79.5" (relative humidity in September).
- "Warsaw possui precipitação em março (mm) 29" (precipitation in March).
- "Warsaw possui recorde de temperatura alta em junho (°C) 36.2" (highest temperature in June).
- "Warsaw possui média recorde de baixa em setembro (°C) 2.7" (lowest temperature in September).

So I can create questions based on both the context and the facts. Let's list possible questions:

1. What is the capital and largest city of Poland? (Context)
2. On which river is Warsaw located? (Context)
3. What is the population of Warsaw in 2012? (Context)
4. When did Warsaw become the capital? (Context)
5. What is the motto of Warsaw? (Facts)
6. What is the category of Warsaw? (Facts)
7. What is the type of synset for Warsaw? (Facts)
8. How many days of precipitation does Warsaw have annually? (Facts)
9. What is the relative humidity in September in Warsaw? (Facts)
10. What is the highest temperature recorded in June in Warsaw? (Facts)

But I need to check if these are all valid. For example, the motto "Semper invicta" is mentioned in the facts, so that's valid. The category is in the facts. The synset type is in the facts. The precipitation data is in the facts. The humidity, March precipitation, and June temperature are in the facts. However, the user's examples didn't use such specific numbers, but the user's instruction allows it.

However, I need to make sure that the answers are accurate. For example, the fact says "Warsaw possui dias de precipitação no ano 162.9" which translates to 162.9 days of precipitation annually. So the answer would be "162.9 dias." Similarly for the other facts.

But I need to check if the facts are part of the content. The user included them as "fatos fornecidos," so yes.

Now, I need to create 10 question-answer pairs. Let me list them:

1. Qual é a capital e maior cidade da Polônia?;Varsóvia
2. Em qual rio Varsóvia fica?;Vístula
3. Qual era a população de Varsóvia em 2012?;1,7 milhão
4. Quando Varsóvia tornou-se a capital?;1569
5. Qual é o lema de Varsóvia?;Semper invicta
6. Qual é a categoria de Varsóvia?;Category:Cidades e vilas no Voivodato de Masóvia
7. Qual é o tipo de sinset para Varsóvia?;WordNet synset-monument-noun-2
8. Quantos dias de precipitação Varsóvia tem anualmente?;162,9 dias
9. Qual é a umidade relativa em setembro em Varsóvia?;79,5%
10. Qual é a temperatura máxima registrada em junho em Varsóvia?;36,2°C

But I need to check if the answers are correctly formatted. For example, in the facts, "Warsaw possui assunto Category:Cities and towns in Masovian Voivodeship" which in Portuguese would be "Category:Cidades e vilas no Voivodato de Masóvia." Similarly for the other facts.

However, some answers might need to be adjusted for clarity. For example, "162.9 dias de precipitação" could be written as "162,9 dias" in Portuguese. Also, the use of commas and periods in numbers might vary. In Portuguese, decimals are often written with commas, so "162,9" and "36,2°C."

But the user's examples used numbers like "2.666 milhões" which uses a period as a thousand separator. However, in Portuguese, the comma is used for decimals. So I need to be consistent. For example, "1,7 milhão" (1.7 million) and "162,9 dias" (162.9 days).

So the final 10 pairs would be as above, but I need to ensure they are all based on the content provided.
