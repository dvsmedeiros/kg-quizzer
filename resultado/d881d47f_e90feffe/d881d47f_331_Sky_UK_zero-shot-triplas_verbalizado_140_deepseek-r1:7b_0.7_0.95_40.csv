First; I should read through the context thoroughly to understand what information is available. BSB was a British satellite broadcasting company that existed from 1986 until its merger with Sky UK in 1990. They provided direct TV services and were involved in various mergers and acquisitions during their time.
   (This comes from the context; mentioning "fundo no ano de 1986")
I think these cover different aspects of the context; each question leads to one correct answer without ambiguity.
Now; I'll format them into a CSV as specified.
