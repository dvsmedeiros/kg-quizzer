Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the provided context and facts. Let's start by carefully reviewing the given information.

The context states that the Yuan Dynasty was founded by Kublai Khan, the grandson of Genghis Khan, in 1271. The facts include various entities related to the Yuan Dynasty, such as battles, people, and events. There's also metadata about the dynasty, like its founding year, dissolution year, capital, and currency.

First, I'll list out key points from the context and facts. The dynasty was established in 1271 and fell in 1368. The capital was Khanbaliq, which is now Beijing. The founder was Kublai Khan. The currency was the Banknote. Some notable events include the Battle of Xiangyang and the Red Turban Rebellion. There are also several battles listed where the Yuan Dynasty was a combatant, like the Battle of Bạch Đằng (1288) and the Battle of Lake Poyang.

Now, I need to form questions that cover these aspects. I should ensure that each question is unique and covers different aspects. For example, one question could be about the founder, another about the founding year, another about the capital, and so on. I also need to check the facts for specific people and events associated with the Yuan Dynasty, such as Ajall Shams al-Din Omar and the Battle of Bun'ei.

I need to be careful not to repeat questions. Each answer must be directly inferable from the provided data. For instance, the question about the dissolution year would be 1368, and the capital is Khanbaliq. The currency is Banknote. Also, the dynasty's name in Mongolian is Dai-ön Yeke Mongγol Ulus, and the Chinese name is Yuán cháo.

I should also consider the events and battles. For example, the Battle of Lake Poyang is mentioned under "place" for the Yuan Dynasty. There's also the Red Turban Rebellions, which occurred during the Yuan Dynasty's decline.

Another point is the common languages, which is Chinese. The deputy in 1340 was Ahmad Fanakati. The dynasty's succession includes the Ming dynasty, Northern Yuan, and Phagmodrupa dynasty.

I need to make sure that each question is clear and directly answered by the facts. Avoid vague questions. For example, instead of asking "What are some events of the Yuan Dynasty?", which might be too broad, I can ask specifically about the Battle of Xiangyang or the Red Turban Rebellion.

Now, compiling all these into 10 distinct questions with answers. Let me check each point again to ensure accuracy and that all answers are present in the provided data.
