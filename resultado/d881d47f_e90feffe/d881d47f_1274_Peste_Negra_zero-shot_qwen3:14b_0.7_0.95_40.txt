Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs about the Black Death based on the provided context. Let me start by recalling what I know about the Black Death. It was a devastating pandemic in the 14th century, caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis. It spread through fleas on rats, and there were different forms like bubonic, pneumonic, and septicemic. The mortality rate was extremely high, leading to significant social and economic changes in Europe.

First, I'll list possible questions. Maybe start with the time period, the causative agent, transmission methods, symptoms, mortality rate, impact on populations, social changes, economic effects, religious responses, and long-term consequences. I need to ensure each question is unique and covers different aspects.

For each question, the answer must be directly from the context. Since the user hasn't provided specific context details beyond the name "Peste_Negra," I'll assume standard historical facts. However, I should make sure not to include any information not implied by the term Black Death. Wait, the user mentioned "contexto" but the only information given is "Peste_Negra." That might be a problem. If the context is only the name, then the answers have to be based on general knowledge of the Black Death. But the user's instruction says to generate based on the provided context. However, the context here is minimal. Maybe the user intended to provide more context but forgot. Assuming that the context is the general knowledge of the Black Death, I'll proceed.

Now, forming the questions. Let me check for each aspect:

1. What was the primary cause? Answer: Yersinia pestis.
2. How was it transmitted? Fleas on rats.
3. What were the main symptoms? Buboes, fever, black spots.
4. What was the mortality rate? Around 30-60%.
5. Which forms of the disease existed? Bubonic, pneumonic, septicemic.
6. How did it affect populations? Massive deaths, labor shortages.
7. What social changes occurred? Peasant revolts, decline of feudalism.
8. Economic impact: Disruption of trade, wages increased.
9. Religious responses: Blamed for sins, flagellants.
10. Long-term consequences: Population decline, changes in medical practices.

Now, translate these into Portuguese and ensure the answers are accurate. Also, make sure each question is different and covers distinct aspects. Avoid repetition. Check for any possible duplicates. For example, mortality rate and impact on populations are related but distinct. Okay, that should cover 10 different aspects.
