Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the provided context and facts. Let me start by thoroughly reading the context and the facts to ensure I cover all relevant points.

First, the context talks about Ctenophora, also known as comb jellies or sea gooseberries. They are marine animals with a cosmopolitan distribution, mostly planktonic, some benthic, bioluminescent, and have cilia-based paddles for movement. They range in size from 1mm to 1.5m. They are similar to medusae but this is a case of convergent evolution, not close phylogenetic relation. They are found in the fossil record since the Cambrian.

Now, looking at the facts, there's a lot of RDF data, but the key points here are the taxonomic information, like the authority (Eschscholtz, 1829), subdivisions (Tentaculata, Nuda, Scleroctenophora), type species (Mnemiopsis leidyi), and various categories they're classified under. Also, there's mention of images and templates related to them.

The examples given in the prompt include questions about their size, movement, digestion, common names, and etymology. I need to ensure that my questions are varied and cover different aspects without repeating similar ones. Let me list possible topics:

1. Classification (phylum, subdivisions)
2. Common names
3. Etymology (Greek origin)
4. Size range
5. Locomotion method (paddles with cilia)
6. Habitat (marine, estuarine)
7. Bioluminescence
8. Fossil record (Cambrian)
9. Taxonomic authority
10. Type species
11. Similarity to medusae (convergent evolution)
12. Subdivisions (classes)
13. Presence in estuaries
14. Classification under YAGO categories

Now, I need to form 10 unique questions. Let's check for repetition. The example already has questions on size, movement, digestion, common names, etymology, habitat. So I can avoid those and focus on other aspects like classification, subdivisions, fossil record, bioluminescence, authority, type species, similarity to medusae, etc.

1. What is the taxonomic authority for Ctenophora? - Eschscholtz, 1829
2. Which period in the fossil record includes Ctenophora? - Cambrian
3. What is the type species of Ctenophora? - Mnemiopsis leidyi
4. What are the three main subdivisions of Ctenophora? - Tentaculata, Nuda, Scleroctenophora
5. Are Ctenophora bioluminescent? - Yes
6. What is the classification of Ctenophora in YAGO? - Animal, Invertebrate, etc. (but maybe more specific)
7. What is the primary reason for the similarity between Ctenophora and medusae? - Convergent evolution
8. What is the common name for Ctenophora in Portuguese? - Carambolas-do-mar or águas-vivas-de-pente
9. Where are Ctenophora found besides the open ocean? - Estuarinas (estuaries)
10. What is the maximum size of adult Ctenophora? - 1.5m

Wait, some of these might be covered in the examples. Let me check again. The examples include "Onde vive o ctenophora?" which is answered as "águas marinhas", but the context also mentions estuarinas. So "estuarinas" could be a separate question. Also, the type species and subdivisions are not in the examples. The examples have "Qual o tamanho da ctenophora?" answered as "1,5 m (4 pés 11 pol)", which is covered in my 10th point. The question about the type species is new. The subdivision into classes is another point. The fossil record in Cambrian is another. Bioluminescence is mentioned in the context as a characteristic. The similarity to medusae is a convergent evolution point. The taxonomic authority is new.

So, compiling these into 10 unique questions without repeating the examples. Let me structure each pair now, ensuring correct answers from the context and facts.
