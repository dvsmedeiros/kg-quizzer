Okay, so I need to create 10 multiple-choice questions and answers based on the provided context about Normans. The output should be in CSV format with each question and answer separated by a semicolon.

First, I'll read through the context carefully to understand what information is available. The context mentions that Normans were a Germanic people settled in northern France, their aristocracy descended from Viking expeditions. They played significant roles in medieval Europe, including colonization of Normandy, the Conquest of England, states in Sicily and southern Italy, and the Crusades. Their history has led to various legends.

Looking at the facts provided, there's a lot about their origins, religion, language, architecture, battles, and notable people. I'll need to extract key points from these facts to form varied questions.

I should ensure that each question is unique and covers different aspects: origin, culture, achievements, religion, language, architecture, etc. Also, the answers must be directly supported by the context or inferred correctly.

Let me start brainstorming possible questions:

1. Where were the Normans originally from? (Vikings/Scandinavia)
2. What was their main occupation or significance? (Viking expeditions, colonizers)
3. Which country did they conquer in 1066? (England)
4. What religion did they follow? (Initially Norse paganism, later Christianity)
5. What language did they speak? (Old Norse/Old Norman)
6. What is the meaning of "Norman"? ("Men from the North")
7. Which famous structure was built by Normans? (Tower of London, castles)
8. Who led them in significant battles? (William the Conqueror)
9. Where in Italy did they establish states? (Sicily and southern Italy)
10. What architectural style is associated with them? (Norman architecture)

I need to make sure each question has a single correct answer, based on the facts provided. I'll also check that there are no repeated questions and that each one covers a different aspect.

Now, I'll structure these into CSV format, ensuring proper punctuation and correctness.
