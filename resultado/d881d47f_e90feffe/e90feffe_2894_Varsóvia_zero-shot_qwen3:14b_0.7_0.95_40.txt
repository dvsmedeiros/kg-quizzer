Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format about Warsaw, based on the provided context. Let me start by recalling the key points about Warsaw. 

First, I should make sure each question is unique and covers different aspects. Let me list possible topics: history, landmarks, population, geography, culture, events, etc.

1. **History**: When was Warsaw founded? I remember it was in the 13th century. So the answer would be 1277.
2. **Landmarks**: What is the name of the famous monument in Warsaw? The Tomb of the Unknown Soldier comes to mind.
3. **Geography**: Which river flows through Warsaw? The Vistula River is the main one.
4. **Population**: What is Warsaw's population? It's the largest city in Poland, around 1.7 million.
5. **Culture**: What is a notable cultural event in Warsaw? The Warsaw Uprising is a significant historical event.
6. **Architecture**: What style is the Royal Route in Warsaw? It's a mix of Gothic, Renaissance, and Baroque.
7. **Education**: What is a famous university in Warsaw? The University of Warsaw is one of the oldest.
8. **Economy**: What is a key industry in Warsaw? Information technology and finance are major sectors.
9. **Transport**: What is the main airport in Warsaw? Frederic Chopin Airport.
10. **Symbols**: What is the symbol of Warsaw? The white eagle, which is the Polish coat of arms.

I need to check that each answer is directly from the context and not inferred. Wait, the context provided was just "Varsóvia" with no details. Oh, the user must have intended to include more context but didn't. Hmm, but in the initial instruction, the user said "contexto" but didn't provide any. Wait, looking back, the user's message says "Contexto: Varsóvia" but nothing else. That's a problem because without specific information, I can't generate accurate questions. However, the user might have made a mistake and forgot to include the actual context. But given the information I have, I have to proceed with general knowledge about Warsaw. 

Wait, the user might have intended to provide a context but forgot. However, in the absence of specific context, I can use general knowledge about Warsaw. So I'll proceed with that, assuming that the user wants questions based on common facts about Warsaw. Let me proceed with the questions I listed, making sure they are accurate and based on known information about Warsaw.
