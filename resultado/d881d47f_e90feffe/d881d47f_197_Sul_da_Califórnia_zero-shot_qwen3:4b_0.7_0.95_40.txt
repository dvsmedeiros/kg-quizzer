Okay, the user wants me to generate 10 objective questions and answers based on the context provided, which is "Sul_da_Califórnia". First, I need to make sure I understand the context. "Sul_da_Califórnia" translates to Southern California, so the questions should be about that region.

I should start by brainstorming different aspects of Southern California. Maybe geography, culture, economy, famous places, historical events, etc. Let me think of 10 different topics. For example, geography, major cities, cultural landmarks, economy, climate, famous people, historical events, sports teams, natural features, and maybe a well-known event or festival.

Wait, the user specified that each question should be related to the content provided. But the context given is just "Sul_da_Califórnia", so I need to make sure the questions are general enough but still accurate. I should avoid making up information that's not in the context. Since the user didn't provide specific details, maybe I should use common knowledge about Southern California but frame them as if they were based on the given context.

Let me check if I need to generate 10 unique questions. The user wants them to be varied and cover different aspects. Let me list possible topics:

1. Major cities in Southern California.
2. Famous landmarks.
3. Economic significance.
4. Climate characteristics.
5. Cultural aspects (like music or film).
6. Historical events.
7. Natural features (coastal areas, mountains).
8. Sports teams.
9. Well-known events or festivals.
10. Maybe a unique feature like a famous person from the area.

Now, I need to make sure each question is clear and has a single correct answer. For example, the major cities would be Los Angeles, San Diego, San Francisco, etc. But wait, San Francisco is in Northern California. So maybe include Los Angeles, San Diego, Orange County, Santa Barbara. That's four cities. Then maybe add a fifth like San Jose or San Mateo.

For the famous landmarks, the Golden Gate Bridge is in San Francisco, but maybe the Hollywood Sign, Disneyland, or the Santa Monica Pier. The Getty Center is also a landmark.

Economic significance could be tech industry, entertainment, tourism, etc.

Climate: Mediterranean climate, mild winters, hot summers.

Cultural aspects: Hollywood as a center for film, music, and fashion.

Historical events: The 1984 Olympics, the 1994 Northridge earthquake.

Natural features: Coastal areas, beaches, mountains like the Santa Monica Mountains.

Sports teams: Los Angeles Lakers, San Diego Chargers (now Chargers), maybe the NFL teams.

Festivals: Coachella, Rose Bowl, etc.

Famous people: Leonardo DiCaprio, Brad Pitt, Taylor Swift, etc.

Wait, but the user said to base the questions on the given context, which is just "Sul_da_Califórnia". So I need to make sure that the questions are about Southern California specifically. For example, San Francisco is in Northern California, so maybe avoid that. So the major cities in Southern California would be Los Angeles, San Diego, Orange County, Santa Barbara, and perhaps San Jose (but that's more in Central California). Maybe include San Diego, Los Angeles, Orange County, and San Bernardino.

For the landmarks, the Hollywood Sign is in Los Angeles, Disneyland in Anaheim, the Santa Monica Pier, the Santa Monica Mountains, the Los Angeles Zoo, the Griffith Observatory, the Walt Disney Concert Hall, etc.

Economic aspects: the entertainment industry, technology (Silicon Beach), tourism, and the tech sector in Southern California.

Climate: Mediterranean, with dry summers and wet winters.

Cultural: film, music, music festivals like Coachella, the beach culture, etc.

Historical: the 1984 Olympics, the 1994 Northridge earthquake, the 1938 San Francisco earthquake (but that's in Northern California, so maybe not). Maybe the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake was in Northern California, so that's not right. Maybe the 1992 Los Angeles riots, but that's more of a historical event.

Natural features: the Pacific coast, the Santa Monica Mountains, the San Gabriel Mountains, the Los Angeles River.

Sports teams: LA Lakers, LA Clippers, San Diego Chargers (now Chargers), maybe the NFL teams.

Festivals: Coachella, the Rose Bowl, the California State Fair in Sacramento (but that's not in Southern California, so maybe not). Maybe the San Diego Comic-Con.

Famous people: Leonardo DiCaprio, Brad Pitt, Taylor Swift, etc., but they are from Southern California.

Now, I need to create 10 unique questions. Let me structure them:

1. What is the most populous city in Southern California?
2. Which landmark is located in Los Angeles and is associated with Hollywood?
3. What is the primary economic activity in Southern California?
4. What is the typical climate of Southern California?
5. Which famous music festival takes place in Southern California?
6. Which natural feature is notable in Southern California?
7. Which major sports team is based in Los Angeles?
8. Which historical event occurred in Southern California in 1994?
9. What is a major cultural aspect of Southern California?
10. Which city in Southern California is known for its coastal beaches and surfing?

Now, checking if these are accurate. For example, the most populous city in Southern California is Los Angeles. The Hollywood Sign is a landmark in LA. The primary economic activity is the entertainment industry. Climate is Mediterranean. Coachella is a music festival in Southern California. Natural features could be the Santa Monica Mountains. A major sports team is the LA Lakers. The 1994 Northridge earthquake was in Southern California. Cultural aspect is film and music. A city known for beaches is Santa Barbara or San Diego.

Wait, but I need to make sure that the answers are correct. Let me verify each:

1. Los Angeles is the most populous city in Southern California. Correct.
2. Hollywood Sign is a landmark in LA. Correct.
3. Entertainment industry is a primary economic activity. Correct.
4. Mediterranean climate. Correct.
5. Coachella is in Southern California. Correct.
6. Santa Monica Mountains. Correct.
7. LA Lakers. Correct.
8. 1994 Northridge earthquake. Correct.
9. Film and music. Correct.
10. San Diego is known for beaches and surfing. Correct.

That seems to cover 10 different aspects. Now, I need to format them into CSV with the specified structure. Each question and answer should be in Portuguese, as per the user's request. Let me translate each question and answer accordingly.

For example:

1. Qual é a cidade mais populosa da Sul da Califórnia?
Resposta: Los Angeles

Now, I need to make sure that these answers are accurate in Portuguese. For example, "Sinal de Hollywood" is correct. "Indústria do entretenimento" is correct. "Clima mediterrâneo" is correct. "Coachella" is the correct name. "Montanhas de Santa Monica" is correct. "Los Angeles Lakers" is correct. "Terremoto de Northridge" is correct. "Cinema e música" is correct. "San Diego" is correct.

I think that's all. Now, format them into the CSV as specified.
