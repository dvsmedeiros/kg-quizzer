Okay; I need to generate 10 question and answer pairs based on the provided context about Southern California. Let's start by understanding what information is available.
The population figure given is for 2019; so a question about that makes sense.
Looking at the list of facts; organizations like CIF Southern Section and California Avocado Society are based there. That leads to a question about what organization is headquartered in the region.
The context mentions earthquakes affecting Southern California; such as the 2014 La Habra earthquake. A question about a significant event makes sense.
The region includes major cities; so asking which large city is part of it could be answered with Los Angeles.
There are several museums listed; so a question about a museum based there would fit well.
Mexican-Americans and other ethnic groups have populations in Southern California; so asking about the largest group by ethnicity is relevant.
These pairs cover various aspects of Southern California; ensuring a broad understanding of the region.
