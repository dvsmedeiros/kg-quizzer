Okay, the user wants me to generate 10 pairs of questions and answers in CSV format based on the provided context and facts. Let me start by understanding the context.

The context explains that civil disobedience is a peaceful form of political protest against unjust laws or oppressive governments. It mentions Henry David Thoreau and Mahatma Gandhi as key figures, with examples like the Indian independence movement and Martin Luther King's work in the US. The facts list various events and movements that used civil disobedience, like the 1998 Russian miners' strike, 2015 Montenegrin crisis, and others.

I need to create questions that are varied and cover different aspects. The user provided examples, so I should follow their structure. Each question must have a unique answer, and the answers should be directly or inferentially from the context.

First, I'll list possible topics: historical figures (Thoreau, Gandhi, MLK), key events (Indian independence, US civil rights), specific movements (End SARS, Women in the Yellow Vest), and perhaps the definition or purpose of civil disobedience.

I need to ensure that the questions don't repeat. Let me think of 10 different angles. Maybe start with the definition, then key figures, then examples from different regions, and some specific events. Also, check that the answers are correct based on the given facts.

For example, a question about who first formulated the concept. The answer would be Henry David Thoreau. Another about the purpose of civil disobedience, which is opposing unjust laws. Then, examples like the Indian independence movement by Gandhi, the US civil rights movement by MLK, the End SARS protests in Nigeria, the Women in the Yellow Vest movement in France, etc.

I should also check the examples provided by the user to avoid repetition. They had questions about the definition, key figures, examples in different countries, and the purpose. So I need to cover similar but different aspects.

Let me make sure each question is distinct. For instance, one about the purpose, another about the origin, another about a specific movement, another about a specific event, and so on. Also, check that the answers are accurate according to the context given.

Now, compiling the 10 pairs. Let me list them out:

1. Who is considered the founder of the concept of civil disobedience?
2. What is the primary goal of civil disobedience?
3. Which historical figure used civil disobedience in the United States?
4. What movement in India was a significant example of civil disobedience?
5. Which movement in France is known for using civil disobedience?
6. What event in Nigeria involved civil disobedience?
7. What is the main idea behind the Women in the Yellow Vest movement?
8. Who is a notable person associated with the concept of civil disobedience?
9. What is the purpose of the Civil Rights Movement in the United States?
10. Which movement in Montenegro used civil disobedience?

Now, verify that each answer is correct based on the context. For example, the first answer is Henry David Thoreau, as per the context. The second is opposing unjust laws. The third is Martin Luther King. The fourth is Gandhi's movement in India. The fifth is the Women in the Yellow Vest. The sixth is the End SARS protests. The seventh is resisting austerity. The eighth is Henry David Thoreau. The ninth is ending racial segregation. The tenth is the Montenegrin protests.

I need to ensure that the answers are present in the facts provided. The user mentioned that the facts include examples like End SARS, Women in the Yellow Vest, and the Civil Rights Movement. Also, the question about the purpose of the Women in the Yellow Vest movement is correct as per the context.

I think that's 10 unique questions. Now, format them into the CSV with the correct delimiters and check for any possible errors. Make sure the answers are in the correct form, like "civil disobedience" as a term, and specific events.
