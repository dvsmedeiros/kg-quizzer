Okay, I need to generate 10 pairs of questions and answers in Portuguese based on the context "Dinastia_Yuan". Let me start by recalling what I know about the Yuan Dynasty. The Yuan Dynasty was established by the Mongols, right? Founded by Kublai Khan in 1271. They ruled China until the Ming Dynasty took over in 1368. The capital was Dadu, which is modern-day Beijing. The Yuan Dynasty is known for its cultural exchanges, like the travels of Marco Polo. Also, they had a unique administrative system with different classes for people, like the Mongols, Semu, Han, and Southerners. The economy was supported by trade along the Silk Road. They also had a period of stability called the Pax Mongolica. But I need to make sure all the answers are based strictly on the provided context. Wait, the user didn't provide any specific content, just the term "Dinastia_Yuan". Hmm, maybe the context is supposed to be the Yuan Dynasty in general. But without specific content, I have to rely on general knowledge. However, the user mentioned "contexto" which was "Dinastia_Yuan" but no further info. Maybe the user expects me to use general knowledge about the Yuan Dynasty. Let me proceed with that.

Now, I need to create 10 varied questions. Let's think of different aspects: establishment, key figures, capital, administrative divisions, cultural aspects, economic policies, decline, notable events, achievements, and legacy. Each question should have a unique answer. Let me list possible questions:

1. Who founded the Yuan Dynasty?
2. When was the Yuan Dynasty established?
3. What was the capital of the Yuan Dynasty?
4. What were the four classes in the Yuan Dynasty's social hierarchy?
5. What is the name of the period of stability under the Yuan Dynasty?
6. Which famous traveler documented his journey to the Yuan Dynasty?
7. What was the main economic activity supported by the Yuan Dynasty?
8. What event led to the fall of the Yuan Dynasty?
9. What was the administrative system of the Yuan Dynasty?
10. What was the significance of the Yuan Dynasty in Chinese history?

Now, check if these are all based on general knowledge. The answers would be: Kublai Khan, 1271, Dadu (Beijing), Mongols, Semu, Han, Southerners, Pax Mongolica, Marco Polo, trade along the Silk Road, the rise of the Ming Dynasty, the Yuan's administrative system with different classes, and its role in cultural exchange and trade.

Wait, but I need to make sure that each answer is correct. For example, the four classes are indeed Mongols, Semu (foreigners), Han (northern Chinese), and Southerners (southern Chinese). The Pax Mongolica is the period of stability. Marco Polo's travels are well-documented. The economy was based on trade. The fall was due to the Ming Rebellion. The administrative system had these classes. The significance includes cultural exchange and the Silk Road.

Now, translate these into Portuguese. Let me check the terms. "Dinastia Yuan" is correct. "Kublai Khan" is the same. "Capital" is "capital", "Dadu" is the name, but in Portuguese, it's often referred to as "Dadu" or "Pekim" (Beijing). But since the context is "Dinastia_Yuan", maybe "Dadu" is better. The four classes: "Mongóis, Semu, Han e Southerners" (but "Southerners" in Portuguese would be "southerners" or "pessoas do sul"). Maybe "Mongóis, Semu, Han e Sulistas" (Sulistas as southerners). The Pax Mongolica is "Pax Mongólica". Marco Polo's journey is "viagem de Marco Polo". Trade along the Silk Road is "comércio ao longo da Rota da Seda". The fall was due to the "Revolução Ming" or "ascensão da Dinastia Ming". The administrative system is "sistema administrativo com diferentes classes". The significance is "importância na história chinesa" (importância na história da China).

Now, structure each pair as "pergunta;resposta" in CSV. Make sure no markdown, just plain text. Check for repetition and ensure each question is unique. Let me write them out:

1. Quem fundou a Dinastia Yuan?;Kublai Khan
2. Em que ano a Dinastia Yuan foi estabelecida?;1271
3. Qual era a capital da Dinastia Yuan?;Dadu
4. Quais eram as quatro classes na hierarquia social da Dinastia Yuan?;Mongóis, Semu, Han e Sulistas
5. Qual é o nome do período de estabilidade durante a Dinastia Yuan?;Pax Mongólica
6. Qual viajante famoso documentou sua jornada à Dinastia Yuan?;Marco Polo
7. Qual atividade econômica era apoiada pela Dinastia Yuan?;comércio ao longo da Rota da Seda
8. Qual evento levou ao fim da Dinastia Yuan?;ascensão da Dinastia Ming
9. Qual foi o sistema administrativo da Dinastia Yuan?;sistema com diferentes classes sociais
10. Qual a importância da Dinastia Yuan na história da China?;promoveu trocas culturais e comerciais

Check for any errors. "Sulistas" might be better as "pessoas do sul" but "Sulistas" is acceptable. "Pax Mongólica" is correct. "Ascensão da Dinastia Ming" is accurate. "Sistema com diferentes classes sociais" is okay. The last answer is a bit vague, maybe "promoveu trocas culturais e comerciais" (promoted cultural and commercial exchanges) is better. Let me adjust that.

Final check: 10 pairs, correct format, no markdown, Portuguese. Looks good.
