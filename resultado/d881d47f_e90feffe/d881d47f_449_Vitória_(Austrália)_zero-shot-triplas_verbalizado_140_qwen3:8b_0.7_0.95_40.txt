Okay, I need to generate 10 CSV pairs of questions and answers based on the provided context and facts about Victoria, Australia. Let me start by understanding the context and facts given.

The context talks about Victoria's geography, population, history, government, economy, culture, and notable landmarks. The facts list various people born or died in Victoria, locations, events, institutions, etc. 

First, I should make sure each question is unique and covers different aspects. Let me brainstorm possible questions:

1. What is the capital city of Victoria? (Answer: Melbourne)
2. Which state is Victoria bordered by to the south? (Answer: Tasmania)
3. When was Victoria officially established as a colony? (Answer: 1851)
4. What is the PIB rank of Victoria in Australia? (Answer: Second)
5. Which university is the oldest in Victoria? (Answer: University of Melbourne)
6. What event is held annually at Melbourne Park? (Answer: Australian Open)
7. Which political party governs Victoria since 2014? (Answer: Labor Party)
8. What is the name of Victoria's state library? (Answer: State Library Victoria)
9. Which river is a subdivision of Victoria? (Answer: Ovens River)
10. What is the population density of Victoria? (Answer: 28 per km²)

Wait, some answers might need to be checked against the facts. For example, the context says Victoria's PIB is second, but the facts mention PIB per capita is sixth. But the question is about PIB rank, so the answer should be second. 

Also, checking the facts for the university, the context says University of Melbourne is the oldest. The facts list several institutions, but the answer should be correct based on context. 

I need to ensure that each answer is directly from the context or facts provided. Let me verify each answer against the content. 

For example, the question about the capital city: the context says Melbourne is the capital. The answer is correct. 

The question about the southern border: the context mentions Tasmania. 

Established as a colony in 1851. Correct. 

PIB rank is second. The context says "segundo estado mais populoso" but PIB is second. 

University of Melbourne is the oldest. 

Australian Open is at Melbourne Park. 

Labor Party governs since 2014. 

State Library Victoria is mentioned in the facts. 

Ovens River is a subdivision. 

Population density is 28 per km². 

I think these are all correct. Now, format them into CSV with semicolons. Make sure there are exactly 10 pairs and no extra text.
