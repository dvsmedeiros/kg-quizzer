Okay, let me try to figure out how to approach this problem. The user wants me to create 10 pairs of questions and answers related to the immune system based on the provided context and facts. 

First, I'll need to understand the structure of the data given. There are several entities like cells, systems, molecules, etc., each with different properties. Each entity is linked to multiple other entities through various relationships. For example, B cells are a type of lymphocyte and also part of the adaptive immune system.

Looking at the context, I see that the immune system has various components, including B cells, T cells, dendritic cells, macrophages, monocytes, microfold cells, and more. Each of these can act as both an antigen receptor and a cell surface molecule for antibodies or antigens.

I should focus on creating questions that test understanding of how each entity functions in the immune system. For instance, one question about B cells as receptors, another about their role in adaptive immunity, etc.

I also need to ensure that each pair includes a clear question and a concise answer. The answers should cover both the receptor aspect (like B cell receptor) and the function of the cell itself (e.g., lymphocyte). 

I'll make sure not to repeat questions or topics already covered in the context. Each question should be unique and relevant, covering different aspects of the immune system's components.

Let me outline possible questions:

1. What receptors do B cells have on antigen molecules? Probably B cell receptor.
2. How are B cells distributed within lymphocytes?
3. What is the main role of T cells in adaptive immunity?
4. Can B cells be activated by an external antigen?
5. How do dendritic cells influence immune responses?
6. What is the primary function of macrophages in the immune system?
7. Why are monocytes considered "wild-type" lymphocytes?
8. Can macrophages directly attack cancerous cells? Possibly through cytokines.
9. What is a key feature of the adaptive immune response?
10. How do B cells contribute to non-adaptive immunity?

Now, I'll convert these into questions and answers based on the provided data.
