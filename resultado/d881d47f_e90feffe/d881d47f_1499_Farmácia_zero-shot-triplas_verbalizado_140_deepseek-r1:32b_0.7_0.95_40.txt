Okay, I'm trying to figure out how to create 10 question-answer pairs based on the given context and facts about Pharmacy. Let me start by understanding what information is provided.

The context explains that Pharmacy is a field studied by pharmacists, focusing on drugs and medications. The facts list various entities related to Pharmacy, such as organizations, journals, companies, and individuals involved in this field.

I need to generate questions that cover different aspects of Pharmacy without repeating similar ones. Each question should have one correct answer clearly derived from the provided information.

Let me go through the facts step by step.

1. Australian Pharmaceutical Formulary is related to Pharmacy.
2. Pharmacy uses several wiki templates like Template:Pharmacy, Template:Div col, etc.
3. Various companies like Apollo Hospitals, Gelson's Markets, and Wegmans offer Pharmacy services or products.
4. Professional associations such as American Society of Consultant Pharmacists and American Pharmacists Association are part of the Pharmacy discipline.

6. Individuals like William Cookworthy and Lucy Everest Boole work in the Pharmacy field.
7. Images representing Pharmacy include "Medicin man.jpg" and "PharmacistsMortar.svg."

Now, I can structure questions around these points:

3. Which companies offer Pharmacy services/products?
4. Name a professional association in Pharmacy.
5. List a journal related to Pharmacy.
