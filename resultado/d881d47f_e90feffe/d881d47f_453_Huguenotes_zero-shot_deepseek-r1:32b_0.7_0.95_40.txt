Okay, I need to generate 10 question and answer pairs about Huguenots based on the provided context. Let me start by reading through the content carefully to understand the key points.

The Huguenots were French Protestants who faced persecution in France, especially after the revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685. They sought refuge in various countries like Switzerland, Germany, England, and the Netherlands. Notable figures among them include John Calvin and Pierre Bayle. Their influence extended to culture, economy, and even politics.

Now, I'll brainstorm different aspects to cover: origins, persecution, key events (like the Edict of Nantes), places of refuge, contributions in various fields, notable individuals, economic impacts, integration into host countries, and their legacy.

I should make sure each question is unique and covers a different angle. Let me draft some questions:

1. What were the Huguenots known as?
2. Which Calvinist doctrine did they follow?
3. When was the Edict of Nantes revoked?
4. Which French king revoked it?
5. Where did many Huguenots find refuge?
6. How did their persecution start?
7. Name a notable Huguenot intellectual.
8. What's one cultural contribution from them?
9. In which German city were they influential?
10. Why did they leave France?

I need to ensure each answer is directly taken from the context. Let me check each against the provided information.

Looks good. Now, I'll format these into CSV as per instructions.
