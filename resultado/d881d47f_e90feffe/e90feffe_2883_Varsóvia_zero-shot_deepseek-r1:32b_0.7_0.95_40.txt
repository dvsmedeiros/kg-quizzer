Okay, so I need to create a quiz about Warsaw with 10 questions and answers in CSV format. Let me think about what I know about Warsaw.

First, Warsaw is the capital of Poland. That's straightforward. So one question could be asking which country's capital it is.

Next, I remember that the city has some important historical sites. There's the Warsaw Uprising Museum, which commemorates the 1944 uprising against Nazi Germany. That could make a good question about what significant event the museum relates to.

The Old Town of Warsaw is a UNESCO World Heritage site. That's another fact worth including as it highlights its cultural significance.

Warsaw has a river flowing through it. I think it's the Vistula River. So a question about which river flows through the city would be relevant.

I know that Warsaw was significantly damaged during WWII, especially during the Uprising in 1944. After the war, the city was rebuilt. That’s an important historical point for a question on reconstruction efforts.

The Palace of Culture and Science is a prominent landmark in Warsaw. It's one of the tallest buildings there, so that could be another question about its name or significance.

One famous person associated with Warsaw is Maria Skłodowska-Curie, the Nobel laureate in physics and chemistry. She was born there. So a question about a notable scientist born in Warsaw makes sense.

The Lazienki Park is a beautiful park in Warsaw known for its gardens and palaces. That's another good point for a question.

Warsaw has an iconic market square called the Old Town Market Square, which is surrounded by historic buildings. A question about the main square could be interesting.

Lastly, Warsaw has a metro system that connects various parts of the city. This is useful for transportation-related questions.

So I need to make sure each question is different and covers various aspects: geography, history, culture, notable landmarks, and people associated with the city. Each should have a clear, correct answer based on this information.
