Okay, so I need to create a CSV with exactly 10 question-answer pairs based on the provided context about British Satellite Broadcasting (BSB). Let me start by understanding the content thoroughly.

First, the context mentions that BSB was a TV company in London providing satellite broadcasts in the UK. It was incorporated in November 1990 to form BSkyB and started transmitting on March 25, 1990. So, key points here are the founding date, incorporation details, start of transmissions.

Looking at the facts section, there's a lot of RDF data which might be a bit tricky for me as I'm new to this. But I can see that BSB owns several TV channels like Galaxy, Now, The Computer Channel, etc. Also, it's involved in producing films such as "Hardware" and "Memphis Belle." These are important because they show the company's reach beyond just broadcasting.

The RDF data also mentions that BSB was founded on December 11, 1986, which is a bit conflicting with the initial context that says it started transmitting in March 1990. I need to make sure not to mix these up. The founding date is earlier than the start of transmissions.

BSB merged with Sky Television PLC to form BSkyB, so that's an important fact about its fate and succession. It was located at Marco Polo House in London, which could be a point for a question about their headquarters.

Now, I need to generate 10 varied questions covering different aspects:

1. Founding date of BSB.
2. Date they started transmitting.
3. Merger forming BSkyB.
4. Location of the company's headquarters.
5. Channels owned by BSB (maybe pick one or list a few).
6. Films produced by BSB.
7. Number of channels they operated.
8. Successor after merging with Sky.
9. Type of media company it was.
10. Whether it still exists under its original name.

I need to make sure each question has only one correct answer and that they don't repeat the same type of information too much. Let me structure them accordingly, ensuring clarity and relevance to the context provided.

Also, I should avoid any markdown or special formatting since the user specified just the CSV without additional comments. Each line will be in Portuguese as required.
