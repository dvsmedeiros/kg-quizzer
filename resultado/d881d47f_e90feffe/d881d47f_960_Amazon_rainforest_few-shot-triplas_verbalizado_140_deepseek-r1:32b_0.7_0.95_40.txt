Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs based on the provided context and facts about the Amazon rainforest. Let me start by carefully reading through the context and facts to identify key points that can be turned into questions.

First, the context mentions that the Amazon is a humid broadleaf forest covering most of the Amazon basin in South America, which spans 7 million square kilometers with 5.5 million covered by tropical forests. It's spread across nine countries, mainly Brazil, Peru, and others like Colombia, Venezuela, etc. The "Amazônia Legal" area was defined in 1966. It’s the largest biome in Brazil, covering nearly half of its territory.

From the facts, I see that it's called the Amazon rainforest in English, has various images, models used on Wikipedia pages, and is associated with different categories like forests, ecoregions, etc. There are mentions of UNESCO designations, deforestation timelines, and famous explorers or people associated with the region.

Now, to create varied questions covering different aspects without repeating similar ones. I'll focus on geographical extent, countries involved, percentage coverage, UNESCO status, main biome, and notable features like the jaguar image.

I should ensure each question has a clear, single correct answer from the context. Avoiding yes/no questions where possible. Also, keeping the language in Portuguese as required.

Let me draft some potential questions:

1. How many countries are part of the Amazon region?
2. Which country has the largest portion of the Amazon rainforest?
3. What percentage of Brazil is covered by the Amazon biome?
4. When was the "Amazônia Legal" area defined?
5. Which UNESCO site is in the Amazon basin?
6. How many square kilometers does the Amazon cover?
7. Which animal's image is a symbol of the Amazon?
8. How much of the world’s tropical forests does the Amazon represent?
9. What category does the Amazon fall under on Wikipedia?
10. When was the Amazon designated as a World Heritage site?

I need to make sure each answer accurately reflects the context without adding extra information.

Let me check each point against the source material to ensure accuracy and avoid confusion.
