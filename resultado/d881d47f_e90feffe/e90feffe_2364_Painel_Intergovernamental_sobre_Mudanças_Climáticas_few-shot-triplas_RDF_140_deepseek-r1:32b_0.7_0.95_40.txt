Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs based on the given context and facts about the IPCC. Let me start by understanding what's provided.

The context explains that the IPCC was created in 1988 under the UN by PNUMA and OMM. Its goal is to synthesize climate change knowledge, specifically focusing on global warming. It doesn't do original research but reviews existing studies. The IPCC has produced five major reports since 1990 and won a Nobel Peace Prize in 2007.

Looking at the facts section, there's RDF data listing people associated with the IPCC, like Bert Bolin, Filippo Giorgi, etc., their roles, and some authors of its publications. Also, details about the organization's classification, abbreviations, headquarters, leaders, parent organizations, and more are included.

I need to create varied questions covering different aspects without repetition. Each question should have a single correct answer from the provided data.

Let me brainstorm possible topics:

1. IPCC's creation: year, UN agencies involved.
2. Purpose and focus areas.
3. Reports produced: count, time span.
4. Nobel Prize details: when awarded.
5. Headquarters location.
6. Key individuals: leaders, members.
7. Affiliated organizations.
8. Abbreviations.

Now, formulating questions:

1. When was the IPCC created? 1988.
2. Which UN agencies established it? PNUMA and OMM.
3. What's its main focus? Global warming.
4. How many major reports have they produced? Five.
5. Since when has it been active? From 1990 to 2014.
6. Where is the headquarters located? Geneva, Switzerland.
7. Who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2007 related to this? IPCC members.
8. What's the abbreviation for the panel? IPCC.
9. Which person was known for their work with the IPCC? Bert Bolin or others.
10. How many reports since its establishment? Five.

Wait, I should ensure each question is unique and covers different aspects without overlapping too much. Maybe include questions about specific members, like who was a leader or author.

Let me adjust:

1. When was the IPCC created?
2. Which UN agencies established it?
3. What's its main focus?
4. How many major reports have they produced since 1990?
5. Where is its headquarters located?
6. Who is the current chair?
7. Which country is Hoesung Lee from?
8. Name a scientist known for their work with the IPCC.
9. When did the IPCC win the Nobel Peace Prize?
10. How many reports have been produced since 1990?

This way, each question covers different areas: creation details, agencies involved, purpose, number of reports, location, leadership, notable members, awards, and publication count.

I think this should meet the requirements. Now, I'll format them into CSV as per instructions.
