Okay, so I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs based on the provided context and facts about the Rhine river. The output should be in CSV format with each line containing a question and its correct answer separated by a semicolon.

First, I'll review the context given. The Rhine is a major European river flowing from south to north, discharging into the North Sea through the Rhine-Meuse-Scheldt delta. It's known as Rhein in German, Rhin in French, Rijn in Dutch, and Rain in Romansh.

Looking at the facts, there are numerous tributaries and locations associated with the Rhine. For example, it mentions that Lahn, Wupper, Nahe, Saar, Moselle, Aare, and others flow into the Rhine. There are also bridges like the Deutz Suspension Bridge and the Ludendorff Bridge crossing it.

Additionally, there are power plants using the Rhine for cooling, such as Biblis Nuclear Power Plant and Philippsburg Nuclear Power Plant. The river's basin includes several countries, including Germany, France, Belgium, Liechtenstein, and Switzerland.

I need to create varied questions covering different aspects: geographical details, tributaries, bridges, power plants, cultural references, and historical events related to the Rhine.

Let me list possible question topics:

1. Length of the Rhine.
2. Countries through which the Rhine flows.
3. Tributaries of the Rhine.
4. Bridges over the Rhine.
5. Power plants using the Rhine for cooling.
6. The delta where the Rhine discharges into the North Sea.
7. Cities along the Rhine, like Cologne.
8. Cultural or historical significance, such as ships named after the Rhine.
9. Natural features associated with the Rhine, like waterfalls.
10. Border regions related to the Rhine.

Now, I'll draft each question ensuring they are clear and cover different aspects without repetition.

For example:
- What is the length of the Rhine river?
- Which countries does the Rhine pass through?
- Name one tributary that flows into the Rhine.
- What bridge crosses the Rhine at Bonn?
- Which nuclear power plant uses the Rhine for cooling?

I need to ensure each answer is directly supported by the context or facts provided, avoiding any assumptions beyond what's given.

Also, I should check for consistency in the names and spellings as per the facts. For instance, "Cologne" is spelled as such in English, but in German, it's Köln.

After drafting all 10 pairs, I'll format them into the CSV structure specified.
