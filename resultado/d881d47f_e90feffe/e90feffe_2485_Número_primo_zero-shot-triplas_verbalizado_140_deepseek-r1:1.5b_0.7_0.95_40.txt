Okay, I need to create 10 pairs of questions and answers based on the context provided. Let me read through the information carefully.

First, the context talks about prime numbers and their properties. It includes various facts about primes, such as their factorization, images representing them (like Sieve of Eratosthenes), classifications (prime number classes), and other representations like Ulam spirals or Gaussian primes. There are also some interesting problems involving primes.

The user provided a detailed list of information, including each prime along with its factorization, properties, images, and associated topics and articles. It also mentions that 103 is the largest prime where n# + 1 is prime, and 15877# + 1 is known as an "extremal" prime.

Given this information, I can structure each pair by using a key and then providing a question based on that key. For example, taking "prime number factored into primes" as the key, I can create questions like:

1. Prime number factored into which types of primes?
2. Which type is most common in natural numbers?

Next, I need to make sure each response is clear and directly related to the information provided without just restating it. Each question should have a unique answer that's either a definition or a property.

I also need to ensure that all 10 pairs are based on different aspects of prime number theory to cover various topics like classification, factorization, images, types of primes, and extremal cases.

Finally, I'll format each pair as per the required CSV structure: question;response. Each pair will be separated by a comma, starting with "pergunta;resposta" at the beginning.
