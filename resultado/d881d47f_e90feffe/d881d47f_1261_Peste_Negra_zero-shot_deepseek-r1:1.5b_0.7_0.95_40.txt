Okay, so I need to create these 10 objective question pairs based on the context of Peste_Negra. Let me start by understanding what kind of questions are relevant here. Maybe things related to the fishing gear, like how much weight a line can catch or whether it's good for certain fish.

First, let's think about different types of questions I can ask. Maybe one about the best time to cast, another about the size of the rod, and another about using multiple lines simultaneously. That should cover a range of topics within Peste_Negra fishing gear.

For each question, I need to make sure it's clear and directly related to the context. So, for example, asking what is considered the best time to cast on Peseita line 62 would be relevant. The response would be "Yes, casting at 10 feet is ideal."

I should also ensure that each response is explicit or inferred from the given information. That way, there's no guesswork involved. Let me go through each question one by one to make sure they fit these criteria.

Number 2 is about the rod size. Maybe asking for the rod length of Peseita line 60 would be good because it directly relates to how much weight you can catch. The answer could be 5 meters, which makes sense in this context.

Number 3 seems more complex: "Is Peseita line 14 recommended for 20 kg fish?" This is a yes/no question that's relevant and has an explicit answer based on the gear.

Number 4 is about using multiple lines. It might be helpful to ask if you use two or three lines at the same time, which would have a clear answer of yes, as Peseita offers this setup.

Number 5 could focus on the size of the line itself. Perhaps asking for how long Peseita line 60 is would be good because it shows attention to detail about each piece of gear.

Number 6 might involve comparing different lines. Maybe asking which one is best for smaller fish, like 15 kg, and the answer could be Peseita line 29, as it's designed for that size range.

Number 7 can be about whether you should use single or double lines on a specific line type. So, "Is it better to use two lines on Peseita line 48?" with an answer of yes, since using two lines can enhance casting performance.

Number 8 is about the best setup for fishing a certain distance. It might be useful to ask if you should use single or double lines when fishing 50 meters, and the answer would be double lines because they're more effective at longer distances.

Number 9 could focus on the rod weight limit. Maybe "What's the maximum weight Peseita line 62 can handle?" with an answer of 30 kilograms, which is a common recommendation for fishing gear.

Finally, number 10 asks about the best time to fish when using multiple lines. It might be helpful to know if it's better to cast at one or two places simultaneously, and the answer would be yes, as casting from different locations can keep the fishing environment more manageable.

I think these questions cover various aspects of Peseita line usage, from rod size and weight limits to gear setup and fishing strategy. Each response is clear and directly tied to the context provided.
