Okay, I need to help create a quiz based on the given context about economic inequality. Let's start by understanding what the user provided.

The context talks about different aspects of economic inequality, like income distribution, wealth distribution, measurements such as Gini coefficient and HDI adjusted for inequality. It also mentions concepts related to equality and some studies about globalization affecting inequality within countries versus between them.

Now, looking at the facts section, there are several resources linked to economic inequality, including books, movements, and scholars. These could be potential sources for generating questions.

The user wants exactly 10 pairs of questions and answers in CSV format, with each question covering different aspects of the content. The questions should vary to cover a broad range of topics within economic inequality without repeating similar ones.

Let me think about possible questions:

1. What is the main difference between income distribution and wealth distribution?
2. Which measurement is most commonly used to assess economic inequality? (Answer: Gini coefficient)
3. How does globalization affect global inequality? (Between vs. within countries)
4. What are the three types of equality mentioned? (Equity, equality of results, equality of opportunities)
5. What do studies suggest about higher inequality and economic growth?
6. Can you name a book that focuses on economic inequality? (Like "Capital in the Twenty-First Century")
7. Who is Branko Milanović? (An economist specializing in this field)
8. What does HDI adjusted for inequality measure?
9. How has globalization impacted inequality within countries?
10. What is one of the consequences of higher economic inequality on growth?

Wait, I need to ensure each question has a single correct answer and that they are all varied. Also, some answers might be inferred from the context but not directly stated.

Let me structure these into proper questions:

1. Qual é a principal diferença entre distribuição de renda e riqueza?
2. Qual medida econômica é mais usada para avaliar desigualdade? (Resposta: Coeficiente de Gini)
3. De que maneira a globalização afeta a desigualdade global?
4. Quais são os três tipos de igualdade mencionados?
5. O que sugerem estudos sobre maior desigualdade e crescimento econômico?
6. Qual livro trata da desigualdade econômica?
7. Quem é Branko Milanović? (Economista)
8. O que mede o Índice de Desenvolvimento Humano Ajustado pela Desigualdade?
9. Como a globalização afeta a desigualdade dentro dos países?
10. Qual consequência da maior desigualdade para o crescimento?

I think these cover different aspects without repetition. Now, I need to phrase them correctly and ensure the answers are accurate based on the context provided.
