Next; I need to extract the text content from each image source tag. The user provided a snippet where the text includes "Jacksonville Civil WarLGHTBTTY.jpg" and others. These are the responses corresponding to each question (city names).
I also need to ensure that I get exactly 10 pairs. The provided HTML seems to have more than enough cities listed; but I'll check how many there are in the template snippet.
1.(Jacksonville; FL)Jackersonville
3.(JJacksonville; FA)Jackson County
5.(Vice_President_Nixon_delivering_campaign_speech_in_Hemming_Park_-_Jacksonville;_Florida.jpg)
