Okay, the user wants me to generate 10 pairs of questions and answers in CSV format based on the provided context and facts. Let me start by understanding the context and the facts given.

The context talks about economic inequality, covering topics like income distribution, wealth distribution, the Gini coefficient, Human Development Index adjusted for inequality, and the impact of globalization. There are also mentions of various images, templates used in Wikipedia, and other related topics like social inequality, Occupy movements, and scholars involved.

The facts list a bunch of templates and images associated with economic inequality, along with some people and movements related to it. Examples given include questions about the Gini coefficient, Oxfam's findings, and the wealth distribution in 2000.

I need to create questions that are varied and cover different aspects of the context. Let me check the examples provided. They include questions about percentages, specific figures, and causes of movements. Also, the user provided examples of questions and answers, so I should follow that structure.

First, I need to make sure the questions are based on the facts listed. The facts mention the Gini coefficient, the Human Development Index adjusted for inequality, the 40% of global assets held by 1%, the 85 richest people vs 3.5 billion people, the 2000 data, the 1% richest having half the wealth in 2016, the Oxfam methodology being questioned, and the 1968 movement in Pakistan.

Also, there are mentions of images like "Global Wealth Distribution 2020 (Property).svg", "2018 Inequality-Adjusted Human Development Index.svg", and "Countries by total wealth (trillions USD), Credit Suisse.png". These images might be relevant for questions about data sources or visual representations.

Additionally, there are scholars and movements mentioned, such as Branko Milanović, Mick Moore, and the Occupy movements in various cities. The user also mentioned the Kuznets curve and the hidden wealth of nations.

I need to avoid repeating similar questions. Let me think of different angles: what is the Gini coefficient used for? What is the Human Development Index adjusted for inequality? How does globalization affect inequality? What are the main causes of Occupy movements? What is the Kuznets curve? What is the main focus of the Nathan Cummings Foundation? What is the main topic of "The Rich and the Rest of Us"? What is the main focus of the "Hidden Wealth of Nations" book? What is the main topic of "Capital in the Twenty-First Century"?

I should check if these questions are covered in the facts. The Gini coefficient is mentioned as the most used measure. The Human Development Index adjusted for inequality is another measure. Globalization is mentioned as reducing global inequality but increasing within-country inequality. The Kuznets curve is a concept related to inequality. The Nathan Cummings Foundation's focus is economic inequality. "The Rich and the Rest of Us" is a book on economic inequality. "Hidden Wealth of Nations" is a non-fiction book on economic inequality. "Capital in the Twenty-First Century" is a book on economic inequality.

Also, the fact that the 1% of the population holds 40% of global assets is mentioned. The 85 richest people vs 3.5 billion people. The 2000 data, the 2016 prediction, the Oxfam methodology being questioned, and the 1968 movement in Pakistan.

I need to make sure each question is based on these facts. Let me draft 10 questions and answers, ensuring they are varied and cover different aspects. Also, check that they are in Portuguese, as per the user's instruction.
