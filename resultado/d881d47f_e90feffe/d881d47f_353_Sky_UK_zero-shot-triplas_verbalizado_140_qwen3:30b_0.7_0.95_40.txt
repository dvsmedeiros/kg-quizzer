Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the provided context and facts about British Satellite Broadcasting (BSB). Let me start by carefully reading through the context and the list of facts to identify key points.

First, the context says BSB was a London-based TV company that provided satellite TV services to the UK. It was incorporated in November 1990 to form BSkyB. It started broadcasting on March 25, 1990. The facts list various categories, types, models, and other details.

I need to make sure each question is unique and covers different aspects. Let me list possible topics:

1. **Incorporation and Formation**: When was BSB incorporated? What company did it form?
2. **Founded Date**: When was BSB founded? The facts mention 1986-12-11 and 1986.
3. **Location**: Where was BSB located? The facts say London, Marco Polo House, England, United Kingdom.
4. **Channels Owned**: Which TV channels were owned by BSB? The facts mention The Movie Channel, The Power Station, Galaxy, The Computer Channel, Now.
5. **Acquisition and Disbandment**: What happened to BSB? It was merged with Sky Television to form BSkyB. It was disestablished in 1990.
6. **Company Type**: What types of organizations was BSB classified as? The facts list multiple types like Company, Organization, SocialGroup, etc.
7. **Facts about Productions**: Which films were produced by BSB? Hardware, Memphis Belle.
8. **Models and Templates**: What wiki templates did BSB use? Template:BSkyB, Template:Infobox company, etc.
9. **Images**: What images represent BSB? British Satellite Broadcasting logo.png, BSBDishes.jpg, etc.
10. **Categories**: What categories was BSB part of? Like Category:British companies established in 1986, Category:1990s in British television, etc.

Now, I need to form 10 distinct questions. Let me check for repetition. For example, multiple mentions of incorporation date, founded date, locations, channels, etc. I need to vary the questions.

Possible questions:

1. When was British Satellite Broadcasting incorporated?
2. What company was formed after BSB's incorporation?
3. In which year was BSB founded?
4. Where was BSB headquartered?
5. Which TV channels were owned by BSB?
6. What happened to BSB in 1990?
7. What type of organization was BSB classified as?
8. Which films were produced by BSB?
9. What wiki template was used for BSB's page?
10. What categories did BSB belong to?

Now, check the facts to ensure answers are correct. For example, the incorporation was in November 1990, forming BSkyB. Founded in 1986. Headquartered in London, Marco Polo House. Channels like The Movie Channel, The Power Station, Galaxy, etc. Disbanded by merging with Sky Television. Types include Company, Organization. Films: Hardware, Memphis Belle. Templates: Template:BSkyB, Template:Infobox company. Categories: British companies established in 1986, 1990s in British TV, etc.

Now, make sure each question is unique and the answers are directly from the context. Avoid similar questions. For example, don't ask about both founded date and incorporation date, but they are different. Also, check that answers are specific. For example, the answer to the channels question should list multiple channels.

Now, format them into CSV with semicolons. Ensure no markdown, just plain text. Let me write them out.
