Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to generate 10 objective questions based on the context provided, which is "Fresno". But wait, the context is just the word "Fresno"—that's a city in California. However, there's no additional information given. Hmm, maybe the user intended to provide more context but forgot. Without more details, it's challenging to create relevant questions. 

But according to the rules, I must base the questions strictly on the provided content. Since the only information given is "Fresno", perhaps I should assume general knowledge about Fresno. However, the user's instructions say to use the content provided, and the content here is minimal. Maybe the user expects me to use my existing knowledge about Fresno to create the questions? But the rules state that the questions should be based on the context provided, which is just the name. 

Wait, the example response in the user's message includes 10 pairs, each with a question and answer. The example uses general facts about Fresno, like its location, population, and notable features. So maybe the user expects me to use common knowledge about Fresno, even though the provided context is minimal. Since the user provided "Fresno" as the context, I should proceed under the assumption that general information about the city is acceptable. 

I need to create 10 varied questions covering different aspects. Let me think of different categories: location, population, economy, education, attractions, sports teams, etc. Each question should have a clear, specific answer. Let me start brainstorming.

1. What is the location of Fresno? Answer: Central Valley of California.
2. What is the population of Fresno? Answer: Around 530,000.
3. What is a major industry in Fresno? Answer: Agriculture.
4. What university is located in Fresno? Answer: California State University, Fresno.
5. What is a notable sports team in Fresno? Answer: Fresno State Bulldogs.
6. What is the elevation of Fresno? Answer: 108 meters.
7. What river flows through Fresno? Answer: San Joaquin River.
8. What is a famous landmark in Fresno? Answer: Forestiere Underground Gardens.
9. What is the climate zone of Fresno? Answer: Mediterranean.
10. What is the main airport near Fresno? Answer: Fresno Yosemite International Airport.

I need to make sure each answer is correct and can be inferred or is common knowledge. Let me verify each point. For example, Fresno is in the Central Valley, yes. Population around half a million. Agriculture is a major industry there. The university is CSU Fresno. The sports team is correct. Elevation is about 108 meters. San Joaquin River runs through. Forestiere Gardens is a known attraction. Mediterranean climate is typical for California's Central Valley. The airport is correct. 

Now, I need to format these into the CSV structure as specified, using semicolons and Portuguese. The user wants the output in CSV format with exactly 10 pairs. Let me check for any possible mistakes or repetitions. Each question is unique and covers different aspects. The answers are all specific to Fresno. I think this meets the requirements.
