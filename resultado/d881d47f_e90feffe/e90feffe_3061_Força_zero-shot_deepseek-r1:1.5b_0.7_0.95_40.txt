Okay, so I need to create 10 pairs of questions and answers based on the provided context about a force. Let me start by understanding what's given.

First, there are facts presented that describe an experiment involving a small metal ball rolling off a table and landing on a sensor measuring displacement. The key information here is the relationship between the time it takes for the ball to fall and how far it lands on the sensor, which is described by the equation \( s = \frac{1}{2} g t^2 \).

Now, to generate questions and answers, I should think of different scenarios that could lead someone to ask about this concept. Since each question must be relevant and directly related to the context, I can vary the scenarios in a meaningful way.

I'll consider each fact as a potential starting point for a question, then create answer questions based on different variables or aspects of the experiment. Each answer should clearly explain the reasoning behind it without needing additional information beyond the given facts.

Let's go through some possible angles:

1. What is the relationship between time and distance in this experiment? This connects to \( s = \frac{1}{2} g t^2 \).

2. How does the height of the table affect the time taken for the ball to fall? That ties into how gravity (g) affects the motion.

3. If a heavier ball is used, how does that change the outcome? This involves how mass influences acceleration under gravity.

4. What factors determine the distance the sensor reads? This could be about other forces or air resistance, but maybe it's more straightforward with the given equation.

5. How long would it take for the same experiment if performed on a different planet? This introduces variables like gravitational acceleration and relates to how time changes with altitude.

6. What happens if the table is placed at an angle? This could affect the trajectory of the ball, introducing projectile motion concepts.

7. If multiple balls are rolled off simultaneously, what's observed? This might involve collecting data over time and observing trends.

8. How does air resistance influence the sensor reading? This requires understanding how drag affects motion, which can be a more complex topic.

9. What if the experiment is performed with objects of varying masses, and how does that affect displacement? This ties into Newton's second law, as mass affects acceleration.

10. If the table were elevated, what would happen to the sensor reading? This involves gravitational potential energy converting to kinetic energy, which is an important physics concept.

Now, I'll structure each question based on these angles and ensure each answer is clear and directly tied to the given facts.
