pergunta;resposta
Okay; the user has provided a query where they want me to generate objective questions and answers based on a given context about imperialism. They specified that I should create exactly 10 pairs in CSV format with specific separators and language.
I should also make sure each question is unique and directly relates to the content provided. Each answer must be accurate and either explicit or inferable from the given information. Since I'm supposed to generate only data; I shouldn't add any explanations outside of what's necessary.
Finally; compiling all these into a CSV format without any extra text is key. Making sure each question and answer pair aligns correctly with the semicolon separator.
