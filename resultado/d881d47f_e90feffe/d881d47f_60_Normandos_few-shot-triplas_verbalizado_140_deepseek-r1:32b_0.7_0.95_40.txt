Okay, so I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs based on the given context and facts about the Normans. Let me read through everything carefully.

First, the context explains that Normans were a Germanic people in northern France, with roots from Vikings. They played significant roles politically, militarily, and culturally across medieval Europe and the Middle East. Their history includes events like the Norman Conquest of England, settlements in Sicily, and involvement in the Crusades.

Looking at the facts section, there are various details about their language, religion, architecture, related ethnic groups, battles they were involved in, and places associated with them. For example, Normans spoke Old Norse and Latin, followed both Norse paganism and Christianity, and built structures like castles and churches that reflect their architectural style.

I should create questions that cover different aspects of this information. Let me list out possible topics:

1. Origin and meaning of the term "Norman."
2. Languages spoken by Normans.
3. Religions practiced.
4. Their role in historical events or battles.
5. Architectural styles they contributed to.
6. Notable individuals or families associated with them.
7. Geographic locations they influenced.

Now, I'll draft questions and ensure each has a clear, correct answer from the provided data. Let me make sure not to repeat similar questions and cover a broad range of topics as instructed.

For example:
- Origin question: Where did the term "Norman" come from?
- Language question: What languages did Normans speak?
- Religion question: What religions were associated with Normans?

I'll continue this process, ensuring each pair is unique and accurately reflects the context.
