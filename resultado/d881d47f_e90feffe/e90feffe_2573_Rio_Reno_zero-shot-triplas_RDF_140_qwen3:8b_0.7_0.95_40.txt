Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants 10 CSV pairs of questions and answers based on the provided context about the Rhine River. First, I need to parse the context and facts given. The main points are the Rhine's length, its flow from south to north through Europe, and its mouth in the North Sea. The facts include various RDF triples, like the source location in Switzerland, the mouth in the Netherlands, and the subdivisions it passes through.

I need to extract key information. For example, the source is Tomasee in Surselva, Switzerland. The mouth is in the North Sea. The river's length is 1,230 km. It's a border between countries like Germany and Switzerland. Also, it's part of several categories in DBpedia, like rivers of Germany and Europe.

Now, I should formulate questions that test knowledge of these facts. Each answer must be directly from the data provided. For instance, a question about the source location would have the answer as specified. Another could be about the mouth. I need to ensure each question is distinct and covers different aspects: length, source, mouth, countries it borders, subdivisions, and maybe its classification as a natural place.

I have to avoid repeating the same type of question. Let me check the facts again. There's also mention of the Rhine Falls, which is a significant feature. Including that in a question could add variety. Also, the subdivisions include Austria, Belgium, Germany, etc. Maybe a question about the countries it flows through.

Wait, the user specified the answer should be in the same language as the query, which is Portuguese. But the examples given in the history are in Portuguese. So the answers need to be in Portuguese as well. Let me confirm that. Yes, the user mentioned the response should be in Portuguese.

Now, I'll create the questions and answers in Portuguese. For example, "Qual é a extensão do rio Reno?" with the answer "1.230 km". Another question could be "O rio Reno nasce em qual localidade?" with the answer "Tomasee, Surselva, Graubünden, Suíça". 

I need to ensure that each answer is directly from the provided data. Also, check that the questions are clear and cover different aspects. Avoid any ambiguity. Let me list out the possible questions and their answers based on the facts.

Make sure there are 10 unique questions. Let me verify each one is distinct and covers different data points. Once done, format them into CSV pairs as specified.
