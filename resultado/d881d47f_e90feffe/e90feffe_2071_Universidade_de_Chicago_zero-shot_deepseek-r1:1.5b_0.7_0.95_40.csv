pergunta;resposta
Okay; I need to help the user generate 10 objective questions in Portuguese based on a given context about the University of Chicago. The context provided is just "Universidade_de_Chicago" without any details or subtopics. 
Another idea could be about extracurricular activities or clubs. Maybe a question like; " qual da seguinte empresa est√° associada ao gradiente de engenharia da universidade de Chicago?" That's direct and focused on the university.
I should avoid making the answers too obscure because they need to be directly related to the given context. Each answer must be clear and specific; so it's easy for the user to understand.
