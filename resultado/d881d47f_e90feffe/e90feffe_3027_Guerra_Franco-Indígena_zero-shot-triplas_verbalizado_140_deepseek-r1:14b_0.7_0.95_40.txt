Okay, I need to create 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the provided context about the French and Indian War. The questions should be varied and cover different aspects of the content. Each question must have a single correct answer derived from the given information.

First, looking at the context, key points include the duration (1754-1763), participants (British vs. French with Native American allies), significant events like battles and sieges, military leaders, and outcomes.

I should ensure each question targets different areas: who participated, important events, dates, key figures, strategies, etc. Also, I must avoid repeating similar questions and stick strictly to the provided facts without adding extra information.

Let me start by listing potential questions from the context:

1. What was the duration of the French and Indian War?
2. Who were the main European powers involved in the war?
3. Which Native American tribe allied with the British?
4. Name a key battle where the British achieved a significant victory.
5. Who was a notable military leader for the British during the war?
6. What role did naval control play in the outcome of the war?
7. Which French military leader commanded forces in North America?
8. When did the decisive phase of the war occur?
9. Name one of the Native American tribes that supported the French.
10. What was a major consequence of the British victory in this war?

Now, I'll match each question with the correct answer from the context:

1. The war lasted from 1754 to 1763.
2. The main European powers were the British and the French.
3. The Iroquois allied with the British.
4. The Battle of Quebec in 1759 was a significant British victory.
5. James Wolfe was a notable British military leader.
6. Naval control allowed the British to dominate trade routes and isolate French forces.
7. Louis-Joseph de Montcalm was a key French commander.
8. The decisive phase occurred between 1758-1760 with major British victories.
9. The Algonquins supported the French.
10. The British gained control of all French territories in Canada.

I need to structure these into CSV format, ensuring each line is "pergunta;resposta" without any additional text. Let me check for clarity and correctness, making sure no information is added beyond what's provided.
