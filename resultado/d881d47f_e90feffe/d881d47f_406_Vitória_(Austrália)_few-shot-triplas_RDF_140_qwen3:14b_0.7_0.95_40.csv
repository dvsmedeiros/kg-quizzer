Wait, the user mentioned that the examples have some answers that are not directly from the data. For instance, "Onde a influência asiática é mais forte em Victoria?;Bendigo" – but the data doesn't mention Bendigo specifically. Hmm, maybe the user expects me to use the data provided, but if there's no info, I should avoid it. However, the example includes that, so maybe I need to check if the data actually supports that. Wait, looking back, the data has "Seal_Rocks_(Victoria)" with "countryAdminDivisions" pointing to Victoria, but nothing about Bendigo. So maybe the user made a mistake in the example. But I need to follow the data strictly. Maybe the user wants me to use the data as is, even if some answers might not be fully accurate based on external knowledge. But I should stick to the given data.
Another example is "Qual é o maior estádio da Austrália?;." which is left blank. Maybe the user expects me to fill that in, but the data doesn't mention the largest stadium. So perhaps I should avoid that. Alternatively, maybe there's an implicit answer in the data. Wait, the data mentions "Kooyonga Oval" and "MCG" (Melbourne Cricket Ground) in some contexts? No, looking through the data, there's "Kooyonga Oval" and "Melbourne Cricket Ground" (MCG) is in the data? Wait, in the data, there's "Kooyonga Oval" and "Melbourne Cricket Ground" is part of the data? Let me check again. The data includes "Kooyonga Oval" and "Melbourne Cricket Ground" might be referred to as "MCG" in some parts. However, the data doesn't explicitly state that MCG is the largest stadium. So maybe I shouldn't assume that. The user's example left it blank, so perhaps it's not in the data. Therefore, I should avoid that question.
- The data includes some economic information, like the examples mentioning diversified economy, second in GDP, fourth in GPS per capita, etc. But the data itself doesn't have those stats; they are from the examples. Wait, the examples are part of the user's input, but the data provided doesn't include those stats. So the user might be combining data from different sources. But the task is to use the data given in the triples.
Also, the data includes "Kooyonga Oval" and "Melbourne Cricket Ground" (MCG) is a famous stadium in Victoria, but the data doesn't explicitly say that. However, the user's example has "Qual é o maior estádio da Austrália?;." which is left blank, so maybe I shouldn't assume that MCG is the largest.
Another example is "Onde a influência asiática é mais forte em Victoria?;Bendigo" but the data doesn't mention Bendigo. However, the user's example includes it, but since the data doesn't have that info, perhaps I should avoid that. Alternatively, maybe the data has "Bendigo" mentioned elsewhere? Let me check again. The data includes "Bendigo" in the example, but not in the triples. So, I should not use that.
