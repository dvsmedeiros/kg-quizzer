Okay, the user wants me to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the context provided, which is about the steam engine. Let me start by understanding the context.

The context is "Motor_a_vapor", which I assume is a Portuguese term for "Steam Engine". I need to create questions that cover different aspects of steam engines. The user specified that each question should be unique and cover different aspects. Let me brainstorm possible topics.

First, the basic components of a steam engine. Maybe questions about the parts like boiler, piston, cylinder, etc. Then, how it works: steam pressure, energy conversion, heat source. Also, historical context, like when they were first used, their applications, and maybe their advantages and disadvantages.

I need to make sure each question is clear and directly related to the content. Let me list possible questions:

1. What is the main component that generates steam in a steam engine?
2. What is the function of the piston in a steam engine?
3. How does a steam engine convert heat into mechanical energy?
4. What is the primary source of heat in a steam engine?
5. When were steam engines first widely used?
6. What is the purpose of the condenser in a steam engine?
7. What are the advantages of using steam engines?
8. What is the main disadvantage of steam engines?
9. What is the role of the crankshaft in a steam engine?
10. In which industries were steam engines primarily used during the Industrial Revolution?

Now, I need to check if these questions are based on the context. The context is "Motor_a_vapor", so I should ensure that the answers are derived from general knowledge about steam engines. Let me verify each answer:

1. Boiler is correct. The boiler generates steam.
2. Piston converts steam pressure into mechanical motion.
3. Heat from the boiler turns water into steam, which drives the piston.
4. Boiler is the main heat source.
5. Steam engines were first used in the early 18th century, like in 1712.
6. Condenser is used to condense steam back into water for reuse.
7. Advantages include simplicity and reliability.
8. Disadvantages include low efficiency and high fuel consumption.
9. Crankshaft converts linear motion to rotational motion.
10. Industries like transportation and manufacturing used them.

I need to make sure these are all correct and not repeating. Let me count: 10 questions, each unique and covering different aspects. The answers are all based on the general knowledge of steam engines. Now, format them into the CSV as per the user's instructions. No markdown, just the CSV with semicolons. Each line has a question and answer. Make sure there are exactly 10 pairs. Let me check again for any possible overlaps or incorrect answers. Everything seems okay. Alright, time to put them in the correct format.
