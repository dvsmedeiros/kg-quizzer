Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs based on the provided context and facts. Let me start by carefully reading through the context and facts to identify key points that can form the basis of the questions.

First, the context explains that the Scottish Parliament is a unicameral legislature located in Edinburgh, with 129 members elected every four years using a mixed system. The current parliament was established by the 1998 Act, and the first session was in 1999. There's also mention of its historical background, merging with the English Parliament in 1707, and the current presiding officer.

Looking at the facts, there's a lot of specific information: numbers of members, leaders (like Presiding Officer Alison Johnstone and First Minister Nicola Sturgeon), electoral regions, political parties involved, committees, locations, and even some specific images and templates used on their Wikipedia page.

I need to ensure that each question is unique and covers different aspects. Let me brainstorm possible questions:

1. How many members does the Scottish Parliament have? (Answer: 129)
2. When was the current Scottish Parliament established? (Answer: 1998 Act, first session in 1999)
3. Who is the current Presiding Officer? (Answer: Alison Johnstone)
4. Where is the Scottish Parliament located? (Answer: Edinburgh, Scotland)
5. What electoral system does it use? (Mixed proportional and geographic)
6. What year did the last general election occur? (2021-05-06)
7. What is the name of the building where it meets? (Scottish Parliament Building)
8. Which political party has the most seats? (Scottish National Party, but need to check facts)
9. What is the role of the First Minister? (Responsible to the Parliament)
10. What committees are active? (Like Health and Sport, Justice, etc.)

Wait, the facts mention "Scottish National Party possui título do assento 2 Scottish Parliament" which might not directly indicate the most seats. Maybe better to use the number of members (129) and the election year. Also, the First Minister is Nicola Sturgeon, but the fact says "Scottish Parliament possui líder Nicola Sturgeon" which might be the Presiding Officer? Wait, the context mentions the current president is [empty], but in the facts, there's "Scottish Parliament possui líder Alison Johnstone" and "Scottish Parliament possui líder Nicola Sturgeon". Maybe there are two roles here.

Need to verify the facts again. The facts list: "Scottish Parliament possui líder Alison Johnstone" and "Scottish Parliament possui líder Nicola Sturgeon". Also, "First Minister of Scotland responde a Scottish Parliament" and "First Minister of Scotland pertence ao departamento Scottish Parliament".

So, Nicola Sturgeon is the First Minister, and Alison Johnstone is the Presiding Officer. That's important.

Another point: the current president is mentioned in the context as being [empty], but in the facts, it's Alison Johnstone. Maybe the user made a typo, but I should use the facts provided.

Also, the last election was in 2016 according to the context, but in the facts, the data says "Scottish Parliament participou da última eleição 2021-05-06". Wait, conflicting info. The context says "the last general election occurred in 2016", but the facts mention "participou da última eleição 2021-05-06". Need to check which is correct. The context might be outdated, but the facts are more detailed. Let me go with the facts.

Another angle: the Scottish Parliament's committees, like "Health and Sport", "Europe and External Relations", etc. The number of electoral regions, such as "Central Scotland" and "North East Scotland".

Also, the fact that the Scottish Parliament uses specific Wikipedia templates, but that might be too niche. Probably better to focus on key roles, locations, numbers, and historical context.

Let me list possible questions and answers:

1. How many members does the Scottish Parliament have? 129
2. When was the current Scottish Parliament established? By the 1998 Act, with the first session in 1999
3. Where is the Scottish Parliament located? Edinburgh, Scotland
4. Who is the current Presiding Officer of the Scottish Parliament? Alison Johnstone
5. What electoral system does the Scottish Parliament use? Mixed system with proportional and geographic representation
6. When was the last general election for the Scottish Parliament held? 2021-05-06
7. What is the name of the building where the Scottish Parliament meets? Scottish Parliament Building
8. Who is the current First Minister of Scotland? Nicola Sturgeon
9. Which political party has the most seats in the Scottish Parliament? Scottish National Party (need to confirm from facts)
10. What are some of the committees active in the Scottish Parliament? Health and Sport, Justice, Europe and External Relations, etc.

Checking the facts again: "Scottish National Party possui título do assento 2 Scottish Parliament" – this might not mean they have the most seats. The facts don't explicitly state which party has the most seats. Maybe it's better to avoid that question unless there's a clear answer.

Alternatively, the number of electoral regions: "Central Scotland (Scottish Parliament electoral region) possui nome parlamentar Scottish Parliament" – but that's redundant. Maybe the number of electoral regions? The facts mention several, like West of Scotland, Central Scotland, North East Scotland, etc. But without a count, that's hard.

Another point: the Scottish Parliament's role in handling specific legislation, but the context says it can legislate in areas not reserved by Westminster.

So, maybe:

11. What areas can the Scottish Parliament legislate on? Any area not reserved by Westminster.

But need to ensure questions are not overlapping with the examples given.

Looking at the examples, they asked about when the current parliament was convoked, the 1998 Act, reserved powers, etc.

So, the user wants 10 unique questions, each based on the provided context and facts, avoiding overlap with the examples.

I think the 10 questions I listed earlier are good, but need to make sure they're not similar to the examples. The examples include questions about the 1998 Act, reserved powers, etc. So my questions about the number of members, location, Presiding Officer, electoral system, last election, building name, First Minister, and committees should be okay.

Now, phrasing the answers correctly based on the facts:

- The current Presiding Officer is Alison Johnstone (from the facts)
- The First Minister is Nicola Sturgeon (from the facts)
- The last election was on 2021-05-06 (from the facts)
- The building is Scottish Parliament Building (from the facts)
- The electoral system is mixed (proportional and geographic)
- The number of members is 129
- Location is Edinburgh
- Committees include Health and Sport, Justice, etc.

I think that's solid. Now, format them as per the examples.
