Okay, let's start by understanding the user's query. They want me to generate 10 objective question-answer pairs based on the provided context about the Normans. The output needs to be in CSV format with semicolons, in Portuguese. 

First, I need to read through the context given. The context is titled "Normandos" which translates to Normans in English. The content is in Portuguese, so I need to make sure I understand it correctly. The main topic is the history and influence of the Normans.

I should start by identifying key points from the context. The Normans were a Viking group who settled in Normandy, France. They were part of the Rollo's expedition and established a significant presence in the 10th century. They are known for their military skills, cultural integration, and later conquests, notably the Norman Conquest of England in 1066 under William the Conqueror. Their influence extended to Sicily and the Holy Roman Empire. They adopted French culture and language, blending their Viking roots with local traditions. Their architectural and administrative contributions are notable, including the construction of castles and the Domesday Book.

Now, I need to create 10 questions that cover different aspects of this context. Each question should have a single correct answer. I need to ensure the questions are varied and not repetitive. Let's brainstorm possible questions:

1. Who was the leader of the Normans in their early settlements? (Rollo)
2. Which region in France did the Normans settle? (Normandy)
3. What was the name of the famous Norman conquest of England? (Norman Conquest)
4. In which year did the Norman Conquest of England occur? (1066)
5. Who was the leader of the Norman Conquest of England? (William the Conqueror)
6. Which king of England was deposed during the Norman Conquest? (Harold II)
7. What cultural group did the Normans primarily originate from? (Vikings)
8. Which document was commissioned by William the Conqueror to assess land and resources? (Domesday Book)
9. What language did the Normans adopt after settling in Normandy? (French)
10. Which other regions besides England did the Normans significantly influence? (Sicily and the Holy Roman Empire)

I need to check if these questions are all covered in the context. The context mentions Rollo, Normandy, the Norman Conquest of England in 1066 by William, Domesday Book, adoption of French, and their influence in Sicily and the Holy Roman Empire. The deposed king is Harold II, which is a common historical fact but might be in the context. The cultural origin as Vikings is mentioned. The document Domesday Book is from the context. 

Now, I need to phrase these questions in Portuguese, ensuring the answers are correct. Let's verify each question against the context to make sure the answers are accurate. Once confirmed, format them into CSV with semicolons, no extra text, and in Portuguese as required.
