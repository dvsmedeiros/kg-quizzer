Okay, the user wants me to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the provided context about the 1973 oil crisis. Let me start by understanding the context and the facts given.

The context mentions the start of the crisis in October 1973, the OPEC embargo, the countries involved, the price increase, and the effects. The facts list various types, categories, images, and templates associated with the crisis. However, the user wants questions and answers that are directly related to the content provided, without adding extra information.

I need to make sure each question is unique and covers different aspects. Let me brainstorm possible questions. The first thing that comes to mind is the start date of the crisis. Then, the countries involved in the embargo. The price increase is another key point. The impact on the US and global economy could be a question. The term used for the first oil shock is important. The expansion of the embargo to other countries. The duration of the embargo. The effect on the economy and politics. The name of the crisis. The role of the Arab-Israeli conflict. And maybe the types of the crisis as per the facts.

Wait, the user mentioned that the answers should be explicitly or inferably from the context. So I need to check if the information is present. The embargo started in October 1973, countries were the ones supporting Israel, the price went from $3 to $12, the US had higher prices, the embargo lasted until March 1974, the first shock, the expansion, the economic effects, the name of the crisis, the conflict, and the types. 

I should avoid repeating similar questions. For example, the first question could be about the start date. The second about the countries involved. The third about the price change. The fourth about the US prices. The fifth about the duration. The sixth about the first shock. The seventh about the expansion. The eighth about the economic effects. The ninth about the name. The tenth about the conflict. That's 10 different aspects. Let me check if all these are covered in the context.

Yes, the context mentions the start date, the countries, the price change, the US prices, the duration, the term "first shock", the expansion to other countries, the economic effects, the name of the crisis, and the Arab-Israeli conflict. That's 10 points. Now, I need to phrase each question clearly and ensure the answers are correct based on the provided information. Also, make sure they are in Portuguese and in CSV format without any extra text.
