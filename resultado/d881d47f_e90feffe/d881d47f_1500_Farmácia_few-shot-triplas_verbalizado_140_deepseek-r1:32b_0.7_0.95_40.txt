Okay, so I need to create a quiz based on the provided context and facts about Pharmacy. The user wants exactly 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format with Portuguese language. Each pair should be separated by a semicolon.

First, let me read through the context again. It mentions that Pharmacy is related to fármacos, drogas, medicamentos, and how users interact with them. Also, it's about pharmacists and their education.

Looking at the facts section, there are various entities listed like Australian Pharmaceutical Formulary, American Society of Consultant Pharmacists, Apollo Hospitals, etc. These all relate to Pharmacy in some way.

I should make sure each question covers different aspects of Pharmacy—like roles, institutions, activities, related fields, etc. Also, I need to avoid repeating similar questions and ensure each has a clear correct answer from the context.

Let me think about potential questions:
1. What is the main focus of Pharmacy? (From the general definition)
2. Which professional works in this field? (Pharmacists)
3. What do pharmacists study and use? (Fármacos, drogas, medicamentos)
4. Where are services provided? (Hospitals like Apollo)
5. How is the word 'farmácia' derived? (From Greek pharmakon)
6. Which organization is related to Pharmacy in Australia? (Australian Pharmaceutical Formulary)
7. What does someone educated in Pharmacy become? (Farmacêutico)
8. In which sectors does Pharmacy operate? (Healthcare, chemical sciences)
9. What's the purpose of the American Society of Consultant Pharmacists? (Consultancy in Pharmacy)
10. Which companies are part of the Pharmacy industry? (Bartell Drugs, etc.)

Now, I'll phrase these into questions ensuring they are clear and each has a single correct answer based on the provided facts.
