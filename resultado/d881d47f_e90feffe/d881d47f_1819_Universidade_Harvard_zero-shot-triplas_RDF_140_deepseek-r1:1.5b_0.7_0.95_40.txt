Alright, let me try to figure out how to approach this problem. The user has provided a detailed list of entities and their corresponding descriptions using the YALP format, which includes classifying subjects under "SocialGroup107950920" with specific attributes like id, free text, user name, wiki page usage, and a link for images.

The main task is to generate ten pairs of questions and answers based on these entities. The instructions mention that the user should provide the 10 even-numbered `pergunta` and `resposta`, so I need to identify which ones are even numbers in the list provided.

Looking at the YALP entries, each one seems to be an object with an id. The ids given are: 23 (which is a class name), 45 (another class), 67, 10920, 11, 3, 8, and then more numbers that don't seem to form pairs yet.

Wait, the user has provided only nine YALP entries. Hmm, maybe I need to check again. Let me count: there are 9 entries listed. But the task is to provide ten pairs. Maybe one of them doesn't have a counterpart in the given list? Or perhaps some entities are missing?

Alternatively, perhaps the user meant that each object should be used to create two questions and an answer, but since some objects might not form complete pairs, only nine can be formed. That would result in nine responses instead of ten.

But wait, the instruction says "generar 10 pares", which translates to ten even-numbered questions. So maybe each object contributes one question with a response, and if there are ten even-numbered ones, then that's it. But given the list provided has only nine objects, I'm confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the user intended for each object to be used in two responses but only provides nine objects. That would mean only nine pairs can be formed, leaving one object unused or incomplete.

Given this confusion, I think the best approach is to proceed with the given data. Since there are nine YALP entries provided, I'll use them all and create 9 responses instead of 10. But if the user expects ten, maybe they made a mistake in counting or providing incomplete information.
