Okay, I need to generate 10 pairs of questions and answers based on the provided context about Jacksonville, Florida. The user wants these in CSV format with each line being "question;answer". 

First, I'll review the context given. It includes general info about Jacksonville's location, population, history, and some specific facts like temperature records, sports teams, notable people born or died there, and various organizations based there.

I should make sure the questions are varied and cover different aspects: geography, demographics, history, climate, sports, culture, etc. Each question must have a single correct answer from the context.

Looking at the context, I can start with basic facts like population size, highest temperature records, notable people born there, historical events, sports teams based in Jacksonville, etc.

I need to avoid repeating similar questions. For example, if one question is about the population rank, another shouldn't be about population again unless it's a different aspect.

Let me list possible questions:

1. What is Jacksonville's population rank in Florida?
2. Which river flows through Jacksonville?
3. When was Jacksonville incorporated?
4. What team plays at EverBank Field?
5. Who led the first European settlement there?
6. Where is the Duval County Courthouse located?
7. What's the highest recorded temperature in January?
8. Which university has its main campus there?
9. Name a professional sports team based in Jacksonville.
10. When did the Super Bowl happen in Jacksonville?

Wait, looking back at the context, some facts are repeated or not directly provided. For example, the EverBank Field hosted the Super Bowl in 2005, so question about that.

I need to ensure each answer is explicitly stated or can be inferred from the context without adding extra info.

Now, I'll structure each line as "pergunta;resposta" in Portuguese.
