Okay, I need to generate 10 pairs of questions and answers based on the provided context about Southern California. The user has given a detailed set of facts and examples, so I should use that information to create varied and accurate quiz questions.

First, I'll go through each fact and think about what kind of question can be formed from it. For example, one fact mentions that May Company California serves the Southern California region, which could lead to a question asking which company does this.

I also need to ensure that each question is unique and covers different aspects of the content. I should avoid repeating similar questions and make sure each has only one correct answer based on the given facts.

Looking at the examples provided, they focus on abbreviations, regions, companies, and demographics. I can follow a similar structure but vary the topics to include more about geography, population, notable people, and organizations.

I'll start by listing potential questions from each fact, making sure they're clear and directly related to Southern California. Then, I'll structure them in CSV format as specified.
