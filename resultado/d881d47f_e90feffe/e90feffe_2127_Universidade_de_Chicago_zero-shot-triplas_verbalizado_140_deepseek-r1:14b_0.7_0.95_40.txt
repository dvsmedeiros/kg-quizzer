Alright, so I need to create 10 pairs of questions and answers based on the provided context about the University of Chicago. The goal is to generate CSV-formatted questions and answers that are relevant and correct. I should make sure each question has only one correct answer, which must be clearly supported by the given information.

First, I'll review the context and facts to identify key points that can form the basis of these questions. The context mentions various aspects like the university's structure, notable schools within it, famous alumni, Nobel laureates, and significant achievements.

I should aim for varied questions covering different areas such as:
- Academic programs
- Notable people associated with the university
- Historical achievements (like the first self-sustaining nuclear reaction)
- Rankings and reputation
- Specific departments or institutions within the university

Now, I'll go through each point to create a question and identify the corresponding answer.

1. **Academic Programs**: The University of Chicago is known for its professional schools like Booth Business School.
2. **Nobel Laureates**: It has a high number of Nobel Prize winners among faculty and alumni.
3. **Historical Achievement**: Developed the first self-sustaining nuclear reaction at Stagg Field.
4. **Press**: Hosts the largest university press in the U.S., University of Chicago Press.
5. **Affiliation**: Member of the Association of American Universities.
6. **Nobel Winners Count**: 98 Nobel laureates as of October 2018.
7. **Fields Medalists**: 21 winners from the University.
8. **Location**: Located in Chicago, Illinois.
9. **Alma Mater**: James Comey is an alumnus.
10. **Image Representation**: The panoramic image "UniversityofChicagoPanoramic.jpg."

I'll structure each question to target these points and ensure they're clear and have only one correct answer. I'll make sure not to repeat similar questions and keep the language in Portuguese as required.

Now, I can draft each question and pair it with the appropriate answer from the context.
