Okay, I need to create a quiz with 10 questions and answers based on the given context about Huguenots. Let me start by understanding the information provided.

First, Huguenots were French Protestants during the religious wars in France around the late 16th century. They faced persecutions under Louis XIV and had to leave after the Edict of Nantes was revoked in 1685. They were mainly Calvinists from the Reformed Church. In regions like Alsace, Moselle, and Montbéliard, they were mostly German Lutherans.

Looking at the RDF data, there are connections to related topics such as Scotch-Irish Americans being associated with Huguenots. Also, places named after Huguenots exist in New York and Staten Island.

I need to generate varied questions covering different aspects: who they were, when they left, religious affiliations, regions affected, consequences of the Edict of Nantes, their emigration destinations, and related groups or places.

Let me draft some possible questions:

1. Who were the Huguenots? (French Protestants)
2. When was the Edict of Nantes revoked? (1685)
3. What religion did most Huguenots follow? (Calvinism/Reformed Church)
4. Which regions had German Lutheran Huguenots? (Alsace, Moselle, Montbéliard)
5. Why did Huguenots leave France? (Persecution and Edict revocation)
6. How many Huguenots left France? (~300,000)
7. What was the consequence of the Edict being revoked? (Loss of religious freedom)
8. Where did Huguenots settle outside France? (USA, etc.)
9. Which American places are named after Huguenots? (Huguenot in New York and Staten Island)
10. Which group is related to Huguenots via Scotch-Irish? (Scotch-Irish Americans)

I should ensure each question has a clear answer from the context without being repetitive.

Let me structure them into 10 questions, making sure they're varied and cover different points.
