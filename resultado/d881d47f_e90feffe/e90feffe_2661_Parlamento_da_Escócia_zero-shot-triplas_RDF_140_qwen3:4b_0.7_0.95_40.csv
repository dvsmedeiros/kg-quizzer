Wait, the leader is listed as Alison Johnstone, George Adam, Nicola Sturgeon, and a date. That might be a mistake, but the data says "Alison_Johnstone>, <http://dbpedia.org/resource/George_Adam>, <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nicola_Sturgeon>, "--05-08" ;". So the last entry is a date, which might be a typo. Maybe the date is for the leader's term? Not sure. But the question should be based on the given data, even if there's a possible error.
