Okay, let's see. The user provided a bunch of triples with information about Fresno, California, and some example Q&A pairs. My task is to generate 10 new question-answer pairs based on the given data.

First, I need to parse the triples to find relevant information. The main entity is "Fresno, California". Let's look through the data:

- The city is part of several classes like AdministrativeDistrict, Area, etc. But the example questions focus on specific facts like population, geography, history, and symbols.

Looking at the properties:

- populationDemonym is "Fresnan"
- areaTotal is 300.43 km²
- populationMetro is 1,008,654 (but the example says "quinta maior cidade da Califórnia" which is fifth, but the actual data here doesn't mention that. Maybe the example is using external knowledge. Hmm, maybe I should stick to the given data.)

Other properties:

- areaLand and areaTotal in meters squared, but maybe converting to km² as done in the example.
- populationDensityKm and populationDensitySqMi
- mapCaption: "Location within Fresno County"
- wikiPageUsesTemplate: some templates
- foaf:depiction includes images like "Seal of Fresno" and "Fresno Rainforest.jpg"
- The name in foaf:name is "Fresno, California"

Examples given include questions about the demonym, meaning of the name, distance to LA, symbols in the flag, pronunciation, historical facts about the Pacific Central Railroad, incorporation year, trolley cars in 1931, and the store that triggered growth.

Now, I need to come up with 10 unique questions. Let's brainstorm:

1. What is the demonym for residents of Fresno? (Fresnan)
2. What is the total area of Fresno in square kilometers? (300.43 km²)
3. What is the population density of Fresno per square kilometer? (1823.43)
4. What is the name of the park depicted in one of the images (Woodward Park Library)? Maybe not, but the example uses images like the seal and rainforest.
5. What is the main symbol on the city's flag? (The example says "folha de freixo" which is "ash leaf", but the seal might have the same symbol. Since the example mentions the flag, maybe the seal's symbol is the ash leaf. The foaf:depiction includes the seal image.)
6. What was the population of the metropolitan area according to the data? (1,008,654)
7. In what year was the Pacific Central Railroad established? (1872)
8. How many trolleys did the Fresno Traction Company operate in 1931? (47)
9. What is the name of the library depicted in the images? (Woodward Park Library)
10. What are the key symbols on the city's seal? (Ash leaf, as per the example's answer)

Wait, the example answer for the flag's highlight is "folha de freixo" (ash leaf). The seal's image is "Seal of Fresno, California.png", which might include the ash leaf. So, the city's flag and seal both might have the ash leaf as a symbol. So, the question could be about the main symbol in the flag or seal.

Also, the example question about the reason people moved to Fresno Station mentions convenience of the railroad and flood concerns. The data here doesn't mention that, but the example uses it. Since the user's example includes that, maybe I should avoid such questions if the data doesn't support it. Wait, in the triples, there's no information about why people moved to Fresno Station. The example might be using external knowledge, but the user wants questions based on the provided data. So I need to only use the given triples.

So, sticking strictly to the data:

- The city's demonym
- Area in km²
- Population density
- Population of the metro area
- Year incorporated (1885)
- Number of trolleys in 1931 (47)
- Symbols in the flag/seal (ash leaf)
- Meaning of the name (ash in Spanish)
- Pronunciation (as given in the example)
- Distance to LA (350 km, but the data doesn't have that; the example uses that, but the data here doesn't mention it. So maybe avoid that unless it's in the triples.)

Wait, the user's example includes "Quanto é a distância entre Fresno e Los Angeles?;350 km" but the triples don't have that info. So maybe the example is using external knowledge. Since the user's instruction is to generate based on the provided data, I should avoid such questions unless the data includes the distance. The data here doesn't, so I shouldn't include it.

So, possible questions from the triples:

1. What is the demonym for people from Fresno? (Fresnan)
2. What is the total area of Fresno in square kilometers? (300.43 km²)
3. What is the population density of Fresno per square kilometer? (1823.43)
4. What is the population of the metropolitan area of Fresno? (1,008,654)
5. In which year was the city of Fresno incorporated? (1885)
6. How many trolleys did the Fresno Traction Company operate in 1931? (47)
7. What is the main symbol depicted on the city's seal? (Ash leaf/ folha de freixo)
8. What does the name "Fresno" mean in Spanish? (Ash)
9. What is the pronunciation of the city's name? (/ˈfrɛznoʊ/ FREZ-noh)
10. What are the key symbols on the city's flag? (Ash leaf, as per the example)

Wait, the example's answer for the flag's highlight is "folha de freixo" (ash leaf), which is the same as the symbol on the seal. The data includes the seal's image, so that's valid. The example question is about the flag, but maybe the actual flag has the same symbol. So the answer would be "ash leaf".

So, compiling all these into 10 Q&As, ensuring they are based on the provided triples.
