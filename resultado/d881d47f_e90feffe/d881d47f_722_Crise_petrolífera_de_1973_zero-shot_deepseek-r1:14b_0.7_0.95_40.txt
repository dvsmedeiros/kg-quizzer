Okay, so I need to create 10 multiple-choice questions and answers based on the context provided about the 1973 oil crisis. First, I'll recall what the 1973 oil crisis was all about. It was triggered by the Yom Kippur War when OPEC countries, led by Saudi Arabia, imposed an oil embargo against the United States and other Western nations that supported Israel. This caused a significant drop in oil production, leading to shortages and price spikes globally.

Now, I need to make sure each question is unique and covers different aspects of the crisis. Let me think about various angles: causes, effects on economies, key countries involved, economic policies implemented as responses, social impacts, etc.

1. For the first question, maybe focus on the primary cause - the Yom Kippur War.
2. The embargo was led by which country? Probably Saudi Arabia.
3. What happened to oil prices during the crisis?
4. Which Organization played a key role? OPEC.
5. How did the US respond with policy? Price controls and rationing come to mind.
6. What effect did it have on inflation? It should have increased.
7. Gas stations closing - why? Due to oil shortages.
8. The crisis led to dependence on alternative energy sources, so which one was emphasized?
9. Which country was least affected because of its own oil production? Norway, maybe.
10. After the crisis, how did countries change their policies? Energy conservation and reducing dependence on OPEC.

Now, I'll structure each question with a clear focus and ensure that the answers are directly supported by the context. Each should be distinct to cover various aspects without overlap. Also, make sure not to repeat similar questions.
