Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format about the Yuan Dynasty based on the provided context and facts. First, I need to parse the context and the facts to extract relevant information.

The context mentions that the Yuan Dynasty was founded by Kublai Khan, the grandson of Genghis Khan, in 1271. The facts include various entries from DBpedia, which list events, people, and places associated with the Yuan Dynasty. For example, there's information about battles, emperors, and the capital.

I need to ensure that the questions are varied and cover different aspects. Let's start with the founder, the establishment year, the capital, and other key figures. Then, I can look at events like battles, the dynasty that followed, and the dissolution year. Also, the official name in Chinese and the capital's name in the Yuan Dynasty's context are important points.

I should avoid repeating similar questions. For example, if I ask about the founder, I shouldn't have another question about Kublai Khan's role unless it's a different aspect. Also, checking the facts for specific data points like the capital being Khanbaliq (Shangdu) and the dissolution year 1368.

Wait, in the facts, under ns1:dateEnd, it says "--09-14", which might be the end date, but the dissolution year is mentioned as 1368 in the categories. The user's example also has a question about when the dynasty was established, which is 1271. The capital is listed as Shangdu, but also Khanbaliq. Maybe the answer should be both names.

I need to make sure each question is distinct. Let's list possible questions:

1. Who founded the Yuan Dynasty? (Kublai Khan)
2. In what year was the Yuan Dynasty established? (1271)
3. What was the official name of the Yuan Dynasty in Chinese? (Dà Yuán)
4. What was the capital of the Yuan Dynasty? (Shangdu/Khanbaliq)
5. Who was the grandfather of Kublai Khan? (Genghis Khan)
6. Which dynasty followed the Yuan Dynasty? (Ming Dynasty)
7. What was the name of the capital in the Yuan Dynasty's context? (Shangdu)
8. When did the Yuan Dynasty end? (1368)
9. What were some key events during the Yuan Dynasty? (Battle of Xiangyang, Mongol conquest of the Song Dynasty)
10. What was the population or area of the Yuan Dynasty? (The facts mention "statArea" as 11,000,000 square kilometers, but I need to check if that's accurate.)

Wait, the "statArea" is listed as "11000000" which could be 11 million square kilometers. However, that seems high for the Yuan's territory. The user might prefer using the data from the facts directly, even if it's a rough estimate.

Also, the official name in Chinese is "Dà Yuán" as per the facts. The capital is mentioned as Shangdu, but also Khanbaliq. The user's example has a question about the official name, so including that as a question.

Another point: the facts mention the dynasty that came after Yuan is the Ming Dynasty, so that's a valid question.

I need to ensure that each answer is directly supported by the provided facts. Let me go through each question and verify the answers against the facts.

1. Founded by Kublai Khan – correct.
2. Established in 1271 – correct.
3. Official name Dà Yuán – yes, in the facts under ns1:p.
4. Capital: Shangdu (ns1:capital "Shangdu") and Khanbaliq (ns1:eventEnd "Fall of Khanbaliq").
5. Genghis Khan as grandfather – correct.
6. Ming Dynasty followed – yes, in ns1:s.
7. Capital's name: Shangdu – from ns1:capital "Shangdu".
8. End date: 1368 (from categories and ns1:dateEnd "--09-14" might be incomplete, but the dissolution year is 1368).
9. Key events: Battle of Xiangyang, Mongol conquest of the Song Dynasty – listed in ns1:event.
10. Area: 11,000,000 square km – from ns1:statArea "11000000".

Now, I need to phrase these into questions and answers, making sure they are clear and concise. Also, avoiding any markdown and ensuring the CSV format is correct with proper commas and semicolons.
