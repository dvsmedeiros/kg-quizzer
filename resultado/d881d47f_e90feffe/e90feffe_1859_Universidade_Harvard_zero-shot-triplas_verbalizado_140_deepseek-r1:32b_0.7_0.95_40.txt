Okay, so I need to create 10 question and answer pairs based on the provided context about Harvard University. The questions should be in Portuguese, each followed by a semicolon and the correct answer. Let me go through the context step by step.

First, the context mentions that Harvard is a private university located in Cambridge, Massachusetts. So I can create a question asking for its location. Got it.

Next, the founding year is 1636. That's another straightforward fact to turn into a question about when it was founded.

Harvard is part of the Ivy League, so I'll include that as a question about which group it belongs to.

The name origin comes from John Harvard, its first benefactor. That's a good point for a question about who it's named after.

Charles William Eliot transformed Harvard into a modern research university during his tenure. So a question about who led this transformation in the late 19th century makes sense.

Drew Gilpin Faust became the first female president in 2007. That's an important milestone, so I'll include that as a question about her role and year.

The main campus is in Harvard Yard, Cambridge. A question about its geographical center would fit here.

Harvard has produced eight U.S. presidents. That's a notable fact for a question about how many past presidents attended.

James Cullen Martin is listed as an alumnus. So I can ask who studied there, using his name as the answer.

Lastly, Harvard Crimson competes in 42 sports under NCAA Division I. A question about their sports participation would be appropriate.

I should ensure each question is unique and covers different aspects of the context without repeating similar ones. Now, let me translate these points into Portuguese questions and answers.
