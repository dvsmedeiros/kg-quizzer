Okay, so I need to generate a quiz based on the context provided about Fresno. The user wants exactly 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format, with each line separated by semicolons and written in Portuguese.

First, I should understand what the context says about Fresno. From the information given, Fresno is known as the "Orange Blossom Capital" or "Rosa dos vents capital," which I think refers to its famous orange groves and flowers. It's a city in California, USA, located in the Central Valley, specifically in Fresno County. The population was around 546 thousand in 2019.

Fresno is an agricultural hub, producing citrus fruits like oranges and lemons, as well as grapes for raisins and wine. The climate there is Mediterranean with hot summers and mild winters. It's a significant transportation center connecting Northern and Southern California, making it important for trade and distribution.

The economy of Fresno relies heavily on agriculture and logistics. There are several parks in the city, such as Woodward Park and Roos Park, which offer activities like hiking and boating. Notable people from Fresno include sports figures like Joe Montana and John Brodie, and actors like Clint Eastwood and Michael Biehn.

Now, I need to create 10 varied questions covering different aspects of Fresno:

1. Nickname related to oranges.
2. Which state it's in.
3. County location.
4. Population size.
5. Main economic activities.
6. Agricultural products.
7. Climate type.
8. Transportation significance.
9. Recreational areas.
10. Renowned personalities.

I'll make sure each question is unique and covers a different facet of Fresno to provide a comprehensive quiz. I should also ensure the answers are accurate based on the context provided.

Finally, I'll format them into CSV as specified, using semicolons as separators and writing everything in Portuguese without any additional explanations.
