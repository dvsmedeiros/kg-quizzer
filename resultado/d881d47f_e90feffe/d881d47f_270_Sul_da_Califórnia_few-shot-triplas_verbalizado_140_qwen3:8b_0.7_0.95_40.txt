Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to generate 10 CSV pairs of questions and answers based on the provided context and facts about Southern California. The main goal is to ensure the questions are varied, cover different aspects, and each has a unique correct answer.

First, I need to parse the context and facts carefully. The context mentions Southern California as the third part of California, with no clear boundaries, bordered by the Pacific Ocean on the west, Mexico to the south, and Arizona to the east. The population in 2019 was around 23.8 million.

Looking at the facts, there are a lot of entities and details. For example, various companies, organizations, and people are associated with Southern California. Also, there are geographical subdivisions like Kern County, San Diego County, and others. There are also mentions of earthquakes, transportation lines, and cultural aspects like languages and museums.

Now, I need to create questions that are distinct and cover different areas. Let me start by listing possible topics: geographical boundaries, population statistics, notable subdivisions, associated organizations, cultural aspects, historical events, and specific locations.

For the first question, the context mentions the population in 2019. That's a straightforward fact. Then, the border with Mexico is mentioned, so a question about that. Next, the area's subdivisions like Kern County. Also, there's the abbreviation SoCal, which is a common question. 

I should check for repetition. For example, the abbreviation question is covered, so avoid similar ones. The facts mention several companies and organizations, so questions about their locations. Also, earthquakes affecting the region. 

I need to ensure each question is unique. For example, one about the population, another about the border, another about the abbreviation, and others about subdivisions, organizations, cultural aspects, and historical events. 

Let me verify each answer is directly from the context or facts. For example, the population in 2019 is 23.8 million. The border with Mexico is mentioned. The abbreviation is SoCal. Subdivisions include Kern County and San Diego County. 

Also, the user provided examples, so I should follow that structure. The examples have questions about abbreviations, population, boundaries, and other regions. I should avoid overlapping with those examples but ensure the questions are relevant.

Now, compiling the 10 questions and answers, making sure they are varied and each answer is directly inferable or explicit from the given data. Avoid any markdown, just plain CSV format as specified.
