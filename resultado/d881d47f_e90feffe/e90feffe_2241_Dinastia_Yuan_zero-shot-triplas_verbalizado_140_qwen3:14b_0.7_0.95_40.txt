Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format, based on the provided context and facts about the Yuan Dynasty. The key points from the context are that the Yuan Dynasty was founded by Kublai Khan, a descendant of Genghis Khan, in 1271. The facts list includes various details like events, people, locations, and other related information.

First, I need to ensure each question is unique and covers different aspects. Let's start with the founder. The context clearly states Kublai Khan founded it, so that's an easy first question. Next, the year of establishment is 1271, which is mentioned in the context and facts.

Then, looking at the facts, there are mentions of the dynasty being dissolved in 1368. That's another point. The capital is listed as Khanbaliq, which is a key fact. The Red Turban Rebellion is associated with the Yuan Dynasty, so that's a historical event to include.

Other people mentioned are Kublai Khan's death during the dynasty, and others like Temür Khan and Jayaatu Khan. The Battle of Xiangyang is an event linked to the Yuan. The use of banknotes as currency is another fact. Also, the dynasty's name in Mongolian script is part of the image legend.

I need to make sure each question is distinct and answers are directly from the provided data. Avoid repetition and ensure all answers are inferable or explicitly stated. Checking for 10 unique aspects: founder, establishment year, dissolution year, capitals, events, people, currency, image details, and related invasions. That should cover it without overlapping.
