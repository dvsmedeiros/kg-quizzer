Okay, I need to generate 10 pairs of questions and answers in CSV format based on the provided context and facts. Let me start by understanding the requirements.

First, the context mentions that EU laws are a system of rules operating in member states, starting from the European Coal and Steel Community after WWII. The EU's goals include promoting peace, values, and well-being. It has political, social, and economic institutions that transcend national states for cooperation. The Court of Justice states the EU represents a new international law order.

The facts list several things: "Law of the European Union" is the main topic. John Bell is a legal scholar in this area. There are journals like Common Market Law Review related to it. Also, there are wiki templates used, and Henry G. Schermers is a subdiscipline.

Now, I need to create 10 varied questions, each with a unique correct answer from the content. Let me brainstorm possible questions.

1. What is the main topic discussed in the context? Answer: Law of the European Union.
2. Who is a legal scholar mentioned? Answer: John Bell.
3. What is the name of the journal related to EU law? Answer: Common Market Law Review.
4. What is the purpose of the EU according to the context? Answer: To promote peace, its values, and the well-being of its peoples.
5. What is the role of the EU's institutions? Answer: To transcend national states for cooperation and human development.
6. What does the Court of Justice state about the EU? Answer: It represents a new order of international law.
7. What are some wiki templates used for the topic? Answer: Template:Redirect category shell, Template:R from word rearrangement, Template:R from move.
8. Who is associated with the subdiscipline of EU law? Answer: Henry G. Schermers.
9. What is the historical origin of EU laws? Answer: The European Coal and Steel Community after WWII.
10. What areas does John Bell work in? Answer: Law of the European Union.

Now, check if these are all unique and cover different aspects. The first question is about the main topic. Second, a person. Third, a journal. Fourth, the EU's purpose. Fifth, institutions' role. Sixth, the Court's statement. Seventh, wiki templates. Eighth, another person. Ninth, historical origin. Tenth, John Bell's areas. That seems varied.

Now, format them into CSV with semicolons. Make sure no markdown, just plain text. Also, check for any repetition. Looks good. Now, write them out as per the example.
