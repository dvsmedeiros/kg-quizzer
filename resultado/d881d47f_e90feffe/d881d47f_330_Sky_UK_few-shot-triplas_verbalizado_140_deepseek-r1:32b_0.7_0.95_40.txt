Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs based on the given context about British Satellite Broadcasting (BSB). Let me start by understanding the content thoroughly.

First, BSB was a TV company in London that provided satellite broadcasts for the UK. It started transmitting in March 1990 and merged with Sky Television in November 1990 to form BSkyB. The company was founded on December 11, 1986, so it existed until 1990 when it merged.

Looking at the facts, BSB had several TV channels under its ownership like Galaxy, The Movie Channel, The Power Station, and The Computer Channel. It also produced films such as Hardware and Memphis Belle. Their headquarters were in London, specifically at Marco Polo House.

BSB used various Wikipedia templates for their pages, which isn't directly relevant for the questions but good to note. They are categorized under several topics like mass media companies established in 1986 and defunct ones disestablished in 1990.

Now, I need to create varied questions covering different aspects: founding date, merger details, channels owned, services provided, production of films, location, ownership, successor, etc. Each question should have a clear, single correct answer from the context.

I'll start by listing potential topics for each question:

1. Founding year and month
2. Merger partner and resulting company
3. Year transmission began
4. TV channels owned
5. Type of service (satellite)
6. Films produced
7. Headquarters location
8. Legal status as a company
9. Successor after merger
10. Categories the company belongs to

Now, I'll formulate each into a question with an answer.

For example:
- When was BSB founded? Answer: 11 December 1986.
- What company did BSB merge with? Sky Television plcto form BSkyB.
And so on for each aspect.

I must ensure that the questions are varied and cover different facets without repetition. Also, each answer should be directly supported by the provided context.

Let me structure this into 10 pairs, making sure they're concise and fit the CSV format as specified.
