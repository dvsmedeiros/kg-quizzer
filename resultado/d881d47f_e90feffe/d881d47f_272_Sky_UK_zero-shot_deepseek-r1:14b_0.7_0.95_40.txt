Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how to create these 10 pairs of questions and answers based on the context provided for Sky_UK. The user wants them in CSV format with each line being "pergunta;resposta". 

First, I need to understand what Sky_UK is all about. From the context given, it seems like it's related to broadcasting services, maybe similar to Sky TV in the UK. So, I should think of different aspects such as channels, features, types of content, and technology.

I'll start by brainstorming possible questions. Maybe something about the number of channels, HD quality, children's programming, movies, sports coverage, pay-per-view options, international availability, and service reputation. 

Wait, let me make sure each question has a clear answer from the context. For example, if Sky_UK offers 100+ channels, that's a good fact to include. High-definition content is another key feature they might offer.

For children's content, Cartoon Network and Nickelodeon are popular channels, so that makes sense as an answer. Including movies would be another angle, maybe grouping them into genres like action, comedy, etc.

Sports coverage is always a big part of TV services, so including major leagues would be relevant. Pay-per-view events could refer to live fights or concerts. 

Offering international viewers access to UK content is another unique selling point. Lastly, customer service reputation is important, so highlighting it as excellent would make sense.

I need to ensure that each question is distinct and covers various aspects without overlapping too much with others. Also, making sure the answers are directly tied to the context provided. 

Alright, I think I have a good list of questions and their corresponding answers now.
