Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs based on the given context about the 1973 oil crisis. The questions should be varied and cover different aspects of the content provided. Each question must have one correct answer that's clearly supported or inferable from the text.

First, I'll review the context again to identify key points:

- The crisis started in October 1973 due to an embargo by Arab OPEC members.
- Targeted countries included Canada, Japan, Netherlands, UK, US, later Portugal, Rhodesia, and South Africa.
- Oil prices rose from $3 to ~$12 per barrel; higher in the US.
- Lasted until March 1974.
- Called the "first oil shock," followed by 1979.

Looking at the facts section, there's a lot about categorizations (like types and categories) but I'll focus on the narrative context for questions.

I need to make sure not to repeat similar questions. Let me list possible topics:

1. Causes: embargo by Arab countries supporting Israel.
2. Timing: start and end dates.
3. Price changes.
4. Affected countries.
5. Outcome/terms (first oil shock).
6. Economic impact.
7. Political actions during the crisis.

Now, I'll structure 10 questions covering these areas:

1. When did it begin? October 1973.
2. Which countries were embargoed initially?
3. What was the price increase to in March 1974?
4. Why was the US targeted? Support for Israel.
5. Who declared the embargo? Arab OPEC members.
6. How long did the crisis last? From October 1973 to March 1974.
7. What led to economic disruption globally? The oil price surge and shortages.
8. What nickname was given to this crisis? First oil shock.
9. Which countries joined later in the embargo? Portugal, Rhodesia, South Africa.
10. How did prices affect the US vs. global?

Wait, I think some of these might overlap or not be fully covered in the context. Let me check:

- The context says until March 1974, so duration is about 5 months.
- The US had higher prices than the $12 mentioned globally.
- The facts mention multiple images and categories but no direct info on economic policies beyond price changes.

I should ensure each question has a clear answer from the text. For example, regarding economic disruption, it's stated that the price surge caused effects globally.

Now, I'll structure each question and answer accordingly, making sure they're distinct and cover different angles.
