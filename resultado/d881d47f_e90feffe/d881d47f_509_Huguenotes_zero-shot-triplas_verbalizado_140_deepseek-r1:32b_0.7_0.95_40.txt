Okay, so I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs based on the given context and facts about Huguenots. Let me start by understanding the information provided.

From the context, I know that Huguenots were French Protestants during the religious wars in France in the second half of the 16th century. About 300,000 left France after persecution under Louis XIV and the revocation of the Edict of Nantes in October 1685. They were mostly Calvinists and part of the Reformed Church. In regions like Alsace, Moselle, and Montbéliard, they were German Lutherans.

Looking at the facts, there are various models used on their Wikipedia page, images associated with them, categories they fall under, related places named after Huguenots, and other historical references. For example, towns in New York and Staten Island are named or have dedications to Huguenots.

Now, I need to create varied questions covering different aspects: historical events, demographics, migration, cultural impact, etc. Each question must have a single correct answer from the provided content.

Let me brainstorm some possible questions:

1. When was the Édito de Nantes revoked?
2. What percentage of Huguenots were Calvinists?
3. Which regions had mostly German Lutheran Huguenots?
4. How many Huguenots left France after persecution?
5. What were the Huguenots known for in terms of religion?
6. Name a place in the US named after Huguenots.
7. When did Louis XIV revoke the Edict of Nantes?
8. Which category includes the history of Huguenots in France?
9. What image symbolizes Huguenot expulsion from La Rochelle?
10. How many Protestants were expelled from La Rochelle in 1661?

Wait, some of these might not be directly answered by the context. For example, point 4 mentions 300,000 left France after revocation, so that's a good question. Point 9 is about an image named "Expulsion from La Rochelle...", which can be a question about which image represents their expulsion.

I also need to ensure each answer is directly from the context or facts provided. Let me check each potential question against the data.

1. Revocation date: October 18, 1685.
2. Calvinists were majoritários, so answer is that they were mostly Calvinist.
3. Alsace, Moselle, Montbéliard had German Lutherans.
4. Number who left: ~300,000.
5. They were Protestant, specifically Huguenots and part of Reformed Church.
6. Orange County, NY or Staten Island have dedications.
7. Revocation by Louis XIV was in 1685.
8. Category is "Huguenot history in France."
9. Image name: Expulsion from La Rochelle...
10. The expulsion involved 300 Protestant families.

This seems to cover different aspects without repetition. Each question has a clear, single answer based on the provided context and facts.
