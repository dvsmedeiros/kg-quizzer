Okay, so I need to create 10 question and answer pairs based on the given context about Victoria in Australia. Let me first read through the context carefully to understand all the key points.

From the context, I know that Victoria is a state in southeastern Australia. It's the smallest mainland state but the second most populous, making it the most densely populated. Melbourne is its capital and the second-largest city in Australia. The economy there is highly diversified, with major sectors including services like finance, healthcare, education, retail, manufacturing, etc. Culturally, Victoria has a lot of museums, art galleries, and it's known for sports, especially hosting events at places like the Melbourne Cricket Ground.

Looking at the facts provided, there are several individuals born or died in Victoria, various locations within Victoria, institutions based there, economic data, cultural landmarks, and more. I need to use these facts to create varied questions covering different aspects of Victoria.

I should make sure each question is clear and directly relates to the content. Each should have only one correct answer that's explicit or can be inferred from the information given. Also, avoid repeating similar questions.

Let me start brainstorming some questions:

1. What is the capital city of Victoria?
2. Which river is named as a subdivision in Victoria?
3. Who was the Prime Minister of Victoria until 2014? (Wait, the context says Daniel Andrews has been Premier since 2014)
4. When did Victoria gain self-government?
5. What is the main economic sector in Victoria?
6. Which landmark hosted the 1956 Summer Olympics?
7. How many universities are there in Victoria?
8. Who was Melbourne's first mayor? (Not sure, perhaps not mentioned)
9. What is the population density of Victoria? (The context says 28 people per km²)
10. Which museum is located in Melbourne?

Wait, I should cross-reference with the facts and context for accuracy.

For example, question about self-government: The context states Victoria achieved self-government in 1855.

Question about population density: Yes, it's mentioned as 28 people per km².

Regarding universities: The context says there are eight public universities, so that can be a question.

The Melbourne Cricket Ground hosted the Olympics, so that's another point.

I need to ensure each answer is directly from the provided content and facts. Let me structure them properly.
