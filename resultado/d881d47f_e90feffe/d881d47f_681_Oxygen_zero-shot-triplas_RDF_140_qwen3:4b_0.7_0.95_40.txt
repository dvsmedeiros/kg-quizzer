Okay, I need to generate 10 objective questions and answers based on the provided context about oxygen. Let me start by reading through the context carefully to identify key points and facts.

First, the oxygen element has atomic number 8, symbol O, and is a chalcogen. It's a reactive nonmetal and a strong oxidizer. It forms compounds with most elements, especially oxides. It's the second most electronegative element after fluorine. In the universe, it's the third most abundant element, but the most in Earth's crust as part of oxides. It's diatomic (O2) in normal conditions, making up 20.8% of Earth's atmosphere. It's essential for life, and its levels are decreasing due to fossil fuel combustion. It's colorless, odorless, and not soluble in water. It's used in respiration, organic molecules, and various industrial applications. The discovery is attributed to Scheele and Priestley, with Lavoisier naming it. The name comes from Greek, referring to its role in acids. Applications include medical oxygen therapy, rocket propellant, etc.

Now, I need to create varied questions covering different aspects. Let's think of different categories: atomic properties, role in life, historical discoveries, applications, etc.

1. Atomic number and symbol: What is the atomic number and symbol of oxygen?
2. Electronegativity: Which element is the second most electronegative?
3. Abundance in the universe: What's the third most abundant element in the universe?
4. Role in Earth's crust: What is oxygen's main component in Earth's crust?
5. Atmospheric composition: What percentage of Earth's atmosphere is O2?
6. Discovery: Who discovered oxygen first, and when?
7. Name origin: Why is oxygen called "oxygen"?
8. Applications: What is one medical use of oxygen?
9. Industrial uses: What is a major industrial use of oxygen?
10. Oxidation state: What is the oxidation state of oxygen in most compounds?

Wait, but the user wants 10 questions. Let me check if these are all covered. Also, need to ensure the answers are accurate based on the context.

Check the context again for any missing points. For example, the name comes from Greek, referring to acids. The discovery by Scheele and Priestley, with Lavoisier naming it. The name is from "oxy" (acid) and "gen" (producer). 

Also, the context mentions that oxygen is used in respiration, organic molecules, and industrial applications like steel production, welding, etc. 

Another point: the atmospheric percentage is 20.8%, which is the diatomic form. 

The answer for the discovery: Scheele discovered it first in 1772, but Priestley discovered it earlier in 1772, and Lavoisier named it in 1777. The question should clarify that.

Also, the answer for the name origin: from Greek, as it's a component of acids.

So compiling these into 10 questions. Let me make sure each question is unique and covers different aspects. Also, check for any possible overlaps or inaccuracies.
