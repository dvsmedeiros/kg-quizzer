Now, I'll create 10 question-answer pairs based on these facts, ensuring each question is clear and the answer corresponds correctly.

I need to make sure that the questions cover different aspects of Warsaw, such as history, geography, culture, economy, sports, entertainment, etc. Also, I should avoid repeating information and ensure accuracy.

Let me start by selecting some key points:

1. Stanisław Mazur died in Warsaw.
2. Rootwater originated from Warsaw.
3. The 2015–16 UEFA Europa League qualifying round had a stadium in Warsaw.
4. Władysław Podkowiński was born in Warsaw.

8. Warsaw has a unique style "coll."
9. Weronika Kordowiecka was born in Warsaw.
10. Warsaw uses the Template:Refend page model.

Wait, that's only 10 facts, so I can use those directly as questions and answers.

But maybe some of these are too direct; perhaps better to rephrase them into more natural questions.

Alternatively, I'll create slightly different phrasing for each question while keeping the same answer.

For example:

Question: Where did Stanisław Mazur pass away?
Answer: In Warsaw.

Another one about the origin of Rootwater:
Question: Which city is the origin of the Rootwater company?
Answer: Warsaw.

Or about the 2015–16 Europa League qualifying round:
Question: Which competition was held in Warsaw during the 2015–16 season?
