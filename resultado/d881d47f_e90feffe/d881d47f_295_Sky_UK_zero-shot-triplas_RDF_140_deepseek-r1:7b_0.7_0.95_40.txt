Alright, I need to create a set of 10 objective questions based on the provided context about British Satellite Broadcasting (BSB) and its history. The goal is to generate pairs of questions and answers that are relevant, accurate, and cover various aspects of the information given.

First, I'll review the context. BSB was formed in 1990 by merging with Sky Television to create BSkyB. It started transmitting in March 1990 and has been a significant player in British television broadcasting through satellite. There's also mention of several channels it owns, such as Galaxy, Hardware, Heil Honey "I'm Home!", Memphis Belle, Now, The Computer Channel, The Movie Channel, The Power Station, and others.

Now, I'll look at the facts provided. The context includes DBpedia triples which describe BSB's history, mergers, locations, and associated channels. The goal is to extract key information that can form questions with clear answers based on this data.

I need to create 10 unique questions that each target a different aspect of BSB. Each question should have one correct answer that's explicitly stated in the context or can be inferred from it.

Let me list out possible areas to ask about:

1. Year BSB was formed.
2. The primary location of BSB's headquarters.
3. A significant product or service offered by BSB.
4. A notable merger involving BSB.
5. The date when BSB started transmitting.
6. Information about a specific channel owned by BSB.
7. The current holding company after the merger in 1990.
8. The location where BSB is based.
9. An associated TV show or film.
10. The fate of BSB after its merger.

Now, I'll draft questions for each area:

1. When was British Satellite Broadcasting formed?
   - Answer: According to the context, BSB was incorporated in November 1990 when it merged with Sky Television to form BSkyB.

2. What is the main location of BSB's headquarters?
