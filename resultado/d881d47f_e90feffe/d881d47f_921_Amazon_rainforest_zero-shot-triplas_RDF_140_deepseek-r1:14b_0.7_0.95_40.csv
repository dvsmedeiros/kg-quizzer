Okay; so I'm trying to figure out how to create these 10 question-answer pairs about the Amazon rainforest based on the provided text. Let me start by reading through the information given carefully.
The text highlights that 10% of the Amazon has already been destroyed; with Brazil leading in deforestation. The Amazon is often referred to as the "lungs of the Earth" because it absorbs large amounts of carbon dioxide and releases oxygen. Protecting it is vital for combating climate change.
Now; I'll make sure each question is clear and the answers are directly supported by the text.
   - The Amazon holds a quarter of the world's species; making it crucial for global biodiversity.
    - The Amazon is home to diverse indigenous communities; many of whom are isolated and still living traditionally.
