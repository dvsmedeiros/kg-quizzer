Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to generate 10 CSV pairs of questions and answers based on the provided context and facts about the Normans. First, I need to understand the context thoroughly.

The context mentions that the Normans were a Germanic people from northern France, with aristocracy from Vikings. They played significant roles in medieval Europe, including the Norman Conquest of England, Sicily, and the Crusades. The facts provided are in RDF format, which might include details about battles, languages, religions, and historical figures.

Looking at the examples, the questions are varied, covering origins, key events, languages, religions, and notable figures. I need to ensure the questions are different and cover various aspects. Let me go through the facts again to extract relevant info.

From the RDF data:
- Normans are an ethnic group with connections to Norsemen and Vikings.
- They used Latin, Old Norman, and Old Norse.
- They were involved in several battles like Battle of Cerami, Civitate, etc.
- They have religious ties to Christianity and Norse paganism.
- Some notable figures include Alexander of Paris, Richard of Salerno, and others.
- They built castles like Taunton Castle and Waytemore Castle.
- The term "Norman" comes from "Northmen" or "Norsemen," meaning "men of the North."

Now, I need to form questions that are distinct and cover different aspects. Let me brainstorm possible questions:

1. Origin of the term "Norman" – answer is "Northmen" or "Norsemen."
2. Languages spoken by Normans – Latin, Old Norman, Old Norse.
3. Key historical event: Norman Conquest of England – 1066.
4. Religious practices – Christianity and Norse paganism.
5. Notable battle: Battle of Hastings – William the Conqueror.
6. Role in Sicily and southern Italy – established states.
7. Ethnic group classification – Germanic people.
8. Architectural style of churches – Norman architecture.
9. Significance of the Bayeux Tapestry – depicts the Norman Conquest.
10. Famous figure associated with Normans – Richard of Salerno.

Wait, I need to check if these are all covered in the facts. The Bayeux Tapestry is mentioned in the image caption. Also, the answer for the origin of the term is "Northmen" or "Norsemen." Let me ensure each answer is directly inferable from the facts.

Avoiding repetition, ensuring each question is unique. Let me structure the CSV accordingly, making sure the separator is a semicolon and the answers are concise.
