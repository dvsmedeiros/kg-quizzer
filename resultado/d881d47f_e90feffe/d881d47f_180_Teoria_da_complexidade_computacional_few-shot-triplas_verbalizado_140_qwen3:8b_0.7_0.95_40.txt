Okay, I need to generate 10 CSV pairs of questions and answers based on the provided context and facts about Computational Complexity Theory. Let me start by understanding the context and facts given.

The main topic is Computational Complexity Theory, which is part of theoretical computer science and mathematics. It focuses on classifying problems based on resource usage, like time and space. The facts mention various people associated with the field, different classifications, templates used in Wikipedia, and some specific terms like "Complexity classes," "Decision Problem.svg," and "Turing machine 2b.svg."

First, I need to create varied questions that cover different aspects. The examples provided include questions about the branch of computer science, classification criteria, problem definitions, resource measurement, models used, and related fields. I should follow that structure but ensure the questions are unique and cover different points.

Looking at the facts, there are mentions of specific templates like Template:Computer science, Template:Garey-Johnson, and Template:Harv. Also, there are references to images like Complexity subsets pspace.svg and Decision Problem.svg. Some people like Christos Papadimitriou, Ryan Williams, and Shmuel Safra are associated with the field.

I should make sure each question is distinct. For example, one question could be about the primary focus of the theory, another about the resources measured, another about the classification of problems, and so on. Also, some facts mention the use of specific models or templates, so a question about those could be included.

Let me list possible questions:

1. What is the primary focus of Computational Complexity Theory? (Answer: classifying problems based on resource usage)
2. Which resources are primarily measured in this theory? (Answer: time and space)
3. What is the term for the classification of problems into complexity classes? (Answer: Complexity classes)
4. Who are some notable researchers in this field? (Answer: Christos Papadimitriou, Ryan Williams, etc.)
5. What models are used to evaluate computational complexity? (Answer: models like Turing machines)
6. What is the significance of classifying problems in this theory? (Answer: determining practical limits of computation)
7. What is the main goal of Computational Complexity Theory? (Answer: classifying problems by difficulty and resource requirements)
8. Which templates are used in Wikipedia for this topic? (Answer: Template:Computer science, Template:Garey-Johnson)
9. What images are associated with this field? (Answer: Complexity subsets pspace.svg, Decision Problem.svg)
10. What is the role of this theory in computer science? (Answer: understanding resource limits and problem classification)

Now, I need to ensure each answer is correct and directly from the context. For example, the answer to the first question should be "classificação de problemas computacionais de acordo com seu uso de recursos" as per the context. The answer to the second question would be "tempo e armazenamento" as mentioned in the facts. 

I need to check that each answer is explicitly stated or can be inferred. Also, avoid repeating similar questions. For instance, the examples given include questions about the branch, classification criteria, etc., so I should cover different angles like models used, associated people, images, templates, and significance.

Finally, format each pair as "pergunta;resposta" in CSV, making sure there are exactly 10 pairs without any extra text or explanations.
