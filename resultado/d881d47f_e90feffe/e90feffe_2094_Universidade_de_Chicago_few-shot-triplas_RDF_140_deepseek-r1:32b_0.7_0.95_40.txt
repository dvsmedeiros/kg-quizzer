Alright, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs based on the given information about the University of Chicago. Let me first understand what data is available.

Looking at the RDF data provided, there are several key points:

1. The University of Chicago has academic affiliations with the Association of American Universities.
2. It's accredited by the Higher Learning Commission.
3. It uses certain Wikipedia templates like Template:Reflist, which might not be directly relevant for questions.
4. There are depictions linked, but again, probably not useful for QA pairs.

The examples given include questions about the type of university, founding year, number of professional schools, research divisions, enrollment, academic contributions, nuclear reaction development, location details, the press, and Obama Center completion.

I need to create 10 similar questions and answers. Let me go through each piece of information:

- Academic affiliations: AAU.
- Accreditation: HLC.
- Wikipedia templates: Probably not useful for QA.
- Depictions: Images, not relevant here.

Looking at the examples, they use specific numbers and facts from the data. So I should extract similar factual info.

For example:
- How many academic research divisions does UChicago have? Four.
- What accreditation does it have? HLC.

Wait, in the RDF, under ns1:accreditation, it's linked to Higher_Learning_Commission. So that can be a question.

Also, looking at the examples, they include questions about professional schools (seven), enrollment (5k), etc.

I need to ensure each QA pair is clear and uses information from the data. Let me structure them:

1. What type of university is the University of Chicago? Research university.
2. When was it founded? 1890.
3. How many professional schools? Seven.
4. How many research divisions? Four.
5. How many students enrolled? Around 5,000.
6. What academic disciplines did UChicago scholars influence? Several.
7. Who developed the first self-sustaining nuclear reaction? Chicago's physics department.
8. Where was this reaction conducted? Under Stagg Field.
9. What is the largest university press in the US? University of Chicago Press.
10. When will Obama Center be completed? 2020.

Wait, but in the RDF, some details might not be present. For example, the number of students is mentioned as 5,000, which I can use. The affiliation with AAU can form a question about its membership.

I think that's a solid approach. Now, let me formulate these into clear Q&A pairs in Portuguese.
