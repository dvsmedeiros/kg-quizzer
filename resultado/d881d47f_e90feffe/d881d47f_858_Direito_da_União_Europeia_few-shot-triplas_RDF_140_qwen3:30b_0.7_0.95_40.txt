Okay, I need to generate 10 pairs of questions and answers based on the provided context and facts. Let me start by carefully reading the context and facts to understand what information is available.

The context mentions that EU laws are a system of rules operating in member states, starting from the European Coal and Steel Community after WWII. The EU's goals include promoting peace, its values, and the well-being of its people. It has political, social, and economic institutions that transcend nation-states for cooperation and human development. The Court of Justice states that the EU represents a "new order of international law."

The facts include some RDF data with resources related to the Law of the European Union, like academic disciplines, scholars, and templates. But the main content is in the context. 

I need to create questions that are varied and cover different aspects. Let me brainstorm possible questions:

1. What is the primary goal of the EU according to the context? The answer would be promoting peace, values, and well-being.
2. What does the EU represent according to its Court of Justice? A new order of international law.
3. What are the main institutions of the EU? Political, social, economic.
4. What is the origin of EU laws? Starting from the European Coal and Steel Community.
5. What are the sources of primary law? Treaties establishing the EU.
6. What are the secondary sources? Regulations and guidelines (from the examples, but need to check if mentioned in context).
7. What are the three sources of EU law? Primary, secondary, and complementary (as per examples, but check if the context mentions this).
8. Which two bodies form the EU's legislature? Parliament and Council.
9. What effect does EU law have on member states' laws? Direct or indirect effect.
10. What is the academic discipline related to EU law? Law of the European Union (from the facts).

Wait, the context says "direito primário, direito secundário e direito complementar" in the examples, but does the provided context mention these? The context says "as leis da União Europeia são um sistema de regras... o Tribunal de Justiça, a UE representa 'uma nova ordem jurídica de direito internacional'". The facts mention some academic disciplines, but the examples have "direito primário, secundário e complementar". However, the user's examples might be based on general knowledge, but the instructions say to generate only from the provided content. 

Wait, the user's examples include questions about primary, secondary, and complementary sources, but the context provided doesn't explicitly mention "direito complementar". The context says "as leis da União Europeia são um sistema de regras que opera nos estados membros... o Tribunal de Justiça, a UE representa 'uma nova ordem jurídica de direito internacional'". The facts include some RDF data, but not sure if it's relevant. 

So, I need to make sure that the answers are based on the context provided, not external knowledge. Let me check again.

The context mentions "direito primário" in the examples, but the actual context text doesn't mention "direito primário, secundário, complementar". However, the examples provided by the user (in the "Exemplos" section) do include those terms. But the user's instruction says to generate questions based on the given context and facts, not external knowledge. So I need to avoid using terms not present in the context.

Wait, the user's examples might be examples of how to format, not necessarily based on the given context. The user's instruction says: "Gerar exatamente 10 pares no formato CSV, com: [...] exclusivamente a partir do conteúdo fornecido."

So I must base the questions and answers only on the provided context and facts. Let me re-examine the context:

- EU laws are a system of rules in member states, started with the European Coal and Steel Community after WWII.
- The EU's goal is to promote peace, values, and well-being.
- The EU has political, social, and economic institutions that transcend nation-states for cooperation and human development.
- The Court of Justice states that the EU is a "nova ordem jurídica de direito internacional".

Facts include RDF data about academic disciplines, but not sure if they are relevant. For example, "Law of the European Union" is a discipline for some resources, but that might not be directly useful for the questions.

So, possible questions:

1. What is the main goal of the EU according to the context? Answer: "promover a paz, seus valores e o bem-estar de seus povos".
2. What does the EU represent according to its Court of Justice? "uma nova ordem jurídica de direito internacional".
3. What are the main institutions of the EU? "instituições políticas, políticas sociais e econômicas".
4. What is the origin of EU laws? "desde a fundação da Comunidade Europeia do Carvão e do Aço após a Segunda Guerra Mundial".
5. What is the role of EU institutions? "transcender os Estados-nação para fins de cooperação e desenvolvimento humano".
6. What is the name of the EU's legal system? "sistema de regras que opera nos estados membros".
7. What are the sources of EU law? The context doesn't mention specific sources like treaties, regulations, etc., so maybe not. But the user's examples have that, but I can't use that unless the context says so. Wait, the context says "as leis da União Europeia são um sistema de regras" but doesn't specify sources. So perhaps avoid that.

Wait, the user's examples have questions about primary, secondary, and complementary sources, but the provided context doesn't mention these. So I can't include those. I need to stick strictly to the context.

So, other questions:

8. What is the academic discipline related to EU law according to the facts? "Law of the European Union" (from the facts, like "ns1:subDiscipline <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Law_of_the_European_Union>").
9. What are the key areas covered by EU institutions? "políticas sociais e econômicas".
10. What is the effect of EU law on member states? "efeito direto ou indireto" (from the examples, but the context doesn't mention this. Wait, the context says "transcendem os Estados-nação para fins de cooperação e desenvolvimento humano", but not about direct/indirect effect. So maybe not. Hmm.

This is tricky. Need to ensure that all answers are explicitly or inferable from the context. Let me list possible questions again:

1. What is the main goal of the EU? (Answer: promote peace, values, and well-being)
2. What does the EU represent according to its Court of Justice? (Answer: a new order of international law)
3. What are the main institutions of the EU? (Answer: political, social, and economic institutions)
4. What is the origin of EU laws? (Answer: European Coal and Steel Community after WWII)
5. What is the role of EU institutions? (Answer: transcend nation-states for cooperation and human development)
6. What is the name of the EU's legal system? (Answer: system of rules operating in member states)
7. What is the academic discipline related to EU law? (Answer: Law of the European Union, from the facts)
8. What are the key areas of EU policies? (Answer: social and economic policies)
9. How does the EU operate in member states? (Answer: as a system of rules)
10. What is the significance of the EU's legal framework? (Answer: represents a new order of international law)

Wait, but some of these might be too similar. Need to vary the questions. Let me check for repetition and ensure each question is unique and covers different aspects.

Another angle: the EU's legal system is a "nova ordem jurídica de direito internacional" (from the context). So a question could be "What is the legal status of the EU according to its Court of Justice?" Answer: "uma nova ordem jurídica de direito internacional".

Another: "What is the foundation of the EU's legal system?" Answer: "a fundação da Comunidade Europeia do Carvão e do Aço após a Segunda Guerra Mundial".

Another: "What are the objectives of the EU's institutions?" Answer: "promover a paz, seus valores e o bem-estar de seus povos".

But need to make sure the answers are directly from the context. Let me structure 10 pairs now.
