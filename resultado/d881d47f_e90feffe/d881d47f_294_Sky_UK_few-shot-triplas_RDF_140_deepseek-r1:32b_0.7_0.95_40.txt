Okay, I'm trying to create a set of 10 questions and answers based on the provided context about British Satellite Broadcasting (BSB). Let me go through each step carefully.

First, I need to understand what information is available in the context. The main points are:

- BSB was a TV company based in London that transmitted via satellite.
- It started broadcasting in March 1990 and merged with Sky Television to form BSkyB in November 1990.
- There's some information about its founding date (December 1986) and location, including Marco Polo House in London.

Looking at the facts section, there are details about various TV channels and films associated with BSB. Channels like Galaxy, Now, The Computer Channel, The Movie Channel, and The Power Station were owned by BSB. Films such as Hardware, Heil Honey I'm Home!, and Memphis Belle had BSB involved in production.

Additionally, the facts mention that BSB was succeeded by Sky UK after its merger.

Now, I need to generate varied questions covering different aspects of this information without repeating similar ones. Each question should have a single correct answer clearly derived from the context.

Let me start drafting possible questions:
