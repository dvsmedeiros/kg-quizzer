Okay, I need to create 10 pairs of questions and answers based on the context provided. The context is about the Normans from "The Normans" article on Wikipedia. 

First, I'll identify different aspects of the Norman history to turn into questions. These could include their origins, key events, cultural influences, and notable figures.

For each question, I need a unique response that clearly answers it. The responses should be in Portuguese since the context is about Normans (Portuguese).

I'll structure each pair with "pergunta" on one side and "resposta" on the other. Separators will be semicolon (;) as specified.

I must ensure all data is accurate, using resources like Wikipedia for specific events and places. I'll avoid adding any external information beyond what's provided in the context.

Now, I'll draft each question and corresponding answer, making sure to cover various aspects of Norman history without repeating questions.
