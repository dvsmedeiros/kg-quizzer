Okay, I need to generate 10 CSV pairs of questions and answers based on the provided context and facts. Let me start by understanding the content given.

The context explains that an empire is a large territory with diverse nations and peoples, governed by a sovereign or oligarchy, often created through conquest. It mentions the term "Imperium" and the Roman Empire as an example. The facts section includes various RDF triples related to imperialism, like organizations, ideologies, motives, and subjects connected to imperialism.

My task is to create questions that are varied and cover different aspects of the content. Each question must have a single correct answer derived from the context or facts. I need to avoid repeating similar questions and ensure the answers are explicit or inferable.

First, I'll look for key points in the context: definition of an empire, characteristics like conquest, central control, examples (Roman Empire), and the term "Imperium." Then, from the facts, there are mentions of ideologies linked to imperialism, such as the Canadian Conservative Party, organizations like the Alliance for National Reconstruction, and subjects related to imperialism in non-fiction works.

I should form questions about the definition of an empire, its structure, examples, related ideologies, and the term "Imperium." Also, some facts mention specific events or entities connected to imperialism, like the Circassian genocide, Herero and Namaqua genocide, and Japanese war crimes. These can be used for questions about motives or subjects related to imperialism.

I need to ensure each question is distinct. Let me brainstorm 10 possible questions:

1. What is the primary characteristic of an empire?
2. What term is used to denote the central authority in an empire?
3. Which historical example is given for the term "Imperium"?
4. What is the main ideology associated with the Canadian Conservative Party (1867–1942)?
5. Which organization is linked to the ideology of imperialism according to the facts?
6. What is a motive associated with the Circassian genocide?
7. What is the subject of the book "Culture and Imperialism"?
8. Which academic discipline is associated with Wolfgang Mommsen?
9. What is the primary topic of the Wikipedia entry for Imperialism?
10. Which event is connected to the motive of imperialism according to the facts?

Now, I'll check if these questions are based on the provided context and facts. The answers should be directly from the content. For example, the answer to question 1 is the definition given in the context. The answer to question 3 is the Roman Empire. The answer to question 4 is Imperialism, as per the Canadian Conservative Party's ideology mentioned in the facts. 

I need to make sure each answer is correct and directly inferable. Also, avoid repetition. Let me verify each question and answer against the facts and context. Once confirmed, format them into CSV pairs with semicolons.
