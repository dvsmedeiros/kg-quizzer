Okay, I need to help the user generate a quiz based on the given context about Dinastia_Yuan. First, I should understand what information is provided.

Dinastia_Yuan seems to be a fictional ancient dynasty with details like its location (China), time period (7th century), ruler (Yuan Ti), capital (Luzhou), and some technologies or advancements they had, like the compass and paper money. Also, it's mentioned that their empire declined after Yuan Ti's death.

Now, I have to create 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format. Each question should be clear, relevant, and based on this context. The answers must be correct and unique.

I'll start by listing various aspects: the founder of Dinastia_Yuan, its location, time period, ruler after the capital was abandoned, technologies they used, their decline post-ruler's death, and maybe a fun fact like a famous person born in Luzhou.

Let me make sure each question is unique to cover different points. I'll also ensure that each answer directly relates to the given information without any ambiguity.

Finally, I'll format them into CSV with the correct separators and structure.
