Okay, I need to generate 10 pairs of quiz questions and answers based on the provided context about British Satellite Broadcasting (BSB). Let me start by carefully reading through all the given information.

First, the main points from the context:

- Founded in 1986.
- Owned several TV channels like The Movie Channel and Galaxy.
- Located at Marco Polo House in London.
