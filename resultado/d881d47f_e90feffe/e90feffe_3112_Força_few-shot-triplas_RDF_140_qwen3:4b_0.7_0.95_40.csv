pergunta;resposta
Another point: the user's examples include "Quanto tempo levou para melhorar as leis de movimento de Sir Isaac Newton?;quase trezentos anos." So the time taken to improve Newton's laws is mentioned. So the question about the historical development might be covered, but maybe the user is expecting more specific questions.
Now, checking if these are valid and not overlapping with the existing examples. The existing examples include the four fundamental forces (strong, weak, electromagnetic, gravitational), but in the user's example, the answer for "Qual é a interação principal mais forte?" is "forte," and "Qual é a interação principal mais fraca?" is "gravitacional." So the first question is okay. The second question's answer is "newton", but in the given data, the "Force" entity has otherunits as kip and poundal, so the answer should be "newton" as the SI unit. The third question is about Newton, which is covered in the example where the answer is "Sir Isaac Newton". The fourth question is about contact vs non-contact, which is not in the examples. The fifth question relates to inertia, which is covered in the example where the answer is "erro fundamental" (fundamental error), but that might be about the belief that maintaining motion required force, which is a different topic. The sixth question is about Newton's laws significance, which is covered in the example. The seventh question is about different types of forces, which is covered in the example. The eighth question is about force affecting motion, which is covered in the example. The ninth question is about energy transfer, which is a new topic. The tenth question is about the Standard Model, which is covered in the example. Wait, the example says "O que a física de partículas fez para descrever as forças subatômicas?;Modelo Padrão", so the tenth question is about the components of the Standard Model, which is covered in the example. So maybe I need to adjust.
So these are all valid. Now, I need to present them in the format of "pergunta;resposta" with the answers in Portuguese, as per the examples. Let me translate them into Portuguese:
