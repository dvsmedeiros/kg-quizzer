Okay, so I need to create 10 pairs of questions and answers based on the given context about Harvard University. The user has provided a detailed description of Harvard's history, notable people associated with it, locations, and other facts. My task is to generate CSV-formatted questions and answers without any additional explanations.

First, I'll go through the context to identify key points that can form the basis of these questions. The context mentions several facts such as Harvard being the oldest university in the US, its location in Cambridge, Massachusetts, notable alumni, prize winners, its endowment size, historical figures associated with it, and more.

I should ensure each question is unique and covers different aspects of the information provided. Let me list some potential topics:

1. Year of establishment
2. Location
3. Nickname/rankings (e.g., Ivy League)
4. Notable alumni or affiliates
5. Financial figures (endowment size)
6. Founding details (named after John Harvard)
7. Historical transformations (secularization, Eliot's changes)
8.-campus layout and notable buildings/sites
9. Number of Nobel laureates
10. First female president

Now, I'll draft questions based on these points.

For example:
- What year was Harvard University founded? Answer: 1636.
- Where is Harvard University located? Cambridge, Massachusetts.
- What is Harvard's nickname or notable league? Ivy League.

I should also consider including questions about specific individuals mentioned in the facts section. For instance, who was the first female president? Drew Gilpin Faust.

Also, the context mentions that Harvard has the largest endowment, so a question about that would be good.

Additionally, since there are many notable alumni and affiliates, I can create a question asking how many Nobel lauretes are associated with Harvard. The context says around 150.

I need to make sure each question is clear and directly relates to the provided facts without adding external knowledge. Each answer should be the exact information given or clearly inferable from it.

Let me structure these into CSV format, ensuring each line has a question and the correct answer separated by a semicolon.
