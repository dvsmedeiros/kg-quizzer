Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs based on the provided context and facts about the Scottish Parliament. The questions should be in Portuguese, vary across different aspects of the content, and each must have a single correct answer derived from the given information.

First, looking at the context: It describes the structure, history, composition, and key figures of the Scottish Parliament. There are specific details like the number of MSPs (129), the electoral system combining plurality and proportionality, regions, leaders, and important dates like the establishment in 1999.

From the facts section, there's information about political parties, constituencies, committees, leaders, and more specific data points such as the Presiding Officer being Alison Johnstone and Nicola Sturgeon as the First Minister.

I should ensure that each question is unique, covers different aspects, and doesn't repeat similar themes. I'll start by identifying key areas to cover: structure (number of members, electoral system), history (establishment year, previous parliament), leadership roles, political parties, committees, locations, and significant dates like the last election.

I need to make sure that each question is clear and directly references the content provided without ambiguity. Also, since some facts might overlap in themes, I must avoid creating similar questions. For example, while both Alison Johnstone and Nicola Sturgeon are leaders, their roles differ, so separate questions can be formed about each.

Let me draft possible questions:

1. How many members does the Scottish Parliament have? (Answer: 129)
2. What electoral system is used for the MSPs? (Answer: Mixed proportional representation)
3. When was the current Scottish Parliament established? (Answer: 1999)
4. Who was the first Presiding Officer? (Answer: Dame Gillian Ewart)
5. What party has the majority? (Answer: Scottish National Party)
6. Which committees does the Parliament have? (List some from facts)
7. Where is the Parliament located? (Answer: Holyrood, Edinburgh)
8. When was the last election? (Answer: May 6, 2016) but in Portuguese date format.
9. Who is the current Presiding Officer? (Answer: Alison Johnstone)
10. Who is the First Minister? (Answer: Nicola Sturgeon)

Now, translating these into Portuguese while maintaining clarity and correctness.

I must also check for any errors or inconsistencies in the facts provided to ensure accuracy. For example, verifying dates like the last election date (May 6, 2016) as opposed to other mentioned dates.

Additionally, I need to make sure that each question doesn't repeat the same information but rather explores different facets of the Parliament's structure and operations.
