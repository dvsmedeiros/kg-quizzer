Okay, I need to generate 10 CSV pairs based on the provided context and facts about Pharmacy. Let me start by understanding the context. The main topic is Pharmacy, its definition, and various related facts from different sources. The user wants questions and answers that are varied, cover different aspects, and have unique answers.

First, I'll look through the facts to identify key points. The context mentions the origin of the word "farmácia" from Greek, which is a good starting point for a question. Then there are various organizations and entities related to Pharmacy, like the American Society of Consultant Pharmacists, Australian Pharmaceutical Formulary, and others. Also, there are mentions of images, models, and categories related to Pharmacy.

I need to ensure each question is distinct. Let me brainstorm possible questions:

1. Origin of the word "farmácia" – already covered in the examples, so maybe not. Wait, the user provided examples, but the instruction says to generate based on the given context and facts. The example questions are different, so maybe I can use those but ensure they are correct.

Wait, the user's examples are in Portuguese. Let me check the context again. The context says Farmácia comes from Greek pharmakon, meaning both remedy and poison. So a question about the origin of the word is valid.

Another fact is that Pharmacy is a professional field, so a question about what Pharmacy is considered as a type. Also, there are mentions of models used in Wikipedia, like Template:Pharmacy, so a question about that.

Also, there are various organizations and companies listed, like the American Society of Consultant Pharmacists, which is mentioned twice. So a question about which organization acts in Pharmacy.

I need to avoid repeating similar questions. For example, if I ask about the origin of the word, that's one question. Then, what is Pharmacy considered as a type (Work, Thing, etc.). Then, which model is used in Wikipedia for Pharmacy. Then, which organization is associated with Pharmacy. Then, what is the main subject of the Australian Pharmaceutical Formulary. Also, there are mentions of images associated with Pharmacy, so a question about that.

Let me list possible questions:

1. De que origem é a palavra "farmácia"? (Answer: do grego φάρμακον / pharmakôn)
2. Qual é o tipo de profissão considerada a farmácia? (Answer: Professional)
3. Qual modelo de página wiki é usado pela farmácia? (Answer: Template:Pharmacy)
4. Qual sociedade atua na disciplina da farmácia? (Answer: American Society of Consultant Pharmacists)
5. Qual é o assunto principal do Australian Pharmaceutical Formulary? (Answer: Pharmacy)
6. Quais são as imagens representativas da farmácia? (Answer: várias imagens como 42-aspetti di vita quotidiana, etc.)
7. Quais entidades pertencem à indústria farmacêutica? (Answer: exemplos como Big B Drugs, Pharmasave, etc.)
8. Qual é a definição da farmácia segundo o contexto? (Answer: ciência praticada por farmacêuticos, estudo de fármacos, interação com usuários)
9. Quais são os modelos de página wiki usados pela farmácia? (Answer: Template:Pharmacy, Template:Health care, etc.)
10. Quais são os setores de atividade da farmácia? (Answer: Health care, Chemical sciences, Health sciences)

Wait, need to make sure each answer is correct based on the facts provided. Let me check each fact again. For example, the Australian Pharmaceutical Formulary is mentioned as having subject Pharmacy, so question 5 is valid. The images include several entries, so question 6 can list some examples. The models used include Template:Pharmacy, Template:Health care, etc. The sectors are Health care and Chemical sciences. The organizations include American Society of Consultant Pharmacists, etc.

Now, need to structure these into 10 pairs, ensuring they are varied and not repeating. Also, answers must be exact as per the facts. Let me compile the CSV accordingly.
