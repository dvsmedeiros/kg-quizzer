Wait, the user's example includes "O que o nome Fresno significa em espanhol?;freixo" which is about the name's meaning in Spanish. So maybe another question about the name's meaning in another language, but that's not in the data. Alternatively, the question could be about the name's origin, but the data doesn't mention that.
Alternatively, the 10th question could be about the area in square meters or another unit, but the data doesn't provide that. Alternatively, the 10th question could be about the historical incorporation year, which is 1885, but that's in the example. Wait, the example has "Em que ano Fresno se tornou uma cidade incorporada?;1885." So that's already covered.
