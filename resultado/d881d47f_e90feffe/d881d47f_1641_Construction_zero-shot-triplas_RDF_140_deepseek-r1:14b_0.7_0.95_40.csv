Okay; so I need to come up with 10 question-answer pairs based on the provided data about construction. Let me go through this step by step.
2. **Broader Category**: `ns2:hypernym` points to "Process;" indicating that construction is a type of process.
6. **Market Size**: Questions about the size of the construction market; possibly using the data points provided.
9. **Challenges in Construction**: Common issues faced in the industry; such as cost overruns or material shortages.
Wait; but I need to make sure each Q&A is clear and directly tied to the data provided. Let me refine these ideas into specific questions that can be answered using the given data points.
The `ns2:hypernym` is "Process;" which means construction falls under processes. So a question about whether construction is considered a process could be answered affirmatively.
The close match descriptor might relate to how construction is categorized in other databases or taxonomies; so that could form another question.
The templates used on the page don't directly provide info for Q&A but indicate how the information is structured; which might not be necessary unless the focus is on content organization.
Thinking about all this; I can structure each question to target a specific property or value. Let me attempt to create 10 such pairs:
Revisiting the data; perhaps "40.2" and "839.1" are significant figures. If "40.2" is a percentage (like 40.2% of GDP in some countries) and "839.1" might be in billions or another unit.
   - Yes; construction is classified under the broader category of "Process."
   - Construction is closely matched with the ZBW descriptor 13173-4; indicating its relation to another vocabulary.
   - Key economic figures include "40.2" and "839.1;" which may represent percentages of GDP or market sizes in billions.
   - The global construction market is notably substantial; with significant contributions indicated by data points such as 839.1 (likely in billions).
   - The construction industry is notably active in regions with high infrastructure development and urbanization; such as Asia and North America.
