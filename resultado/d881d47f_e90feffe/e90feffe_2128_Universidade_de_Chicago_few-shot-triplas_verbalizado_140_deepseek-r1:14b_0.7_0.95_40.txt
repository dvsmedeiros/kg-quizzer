Okay, so I need to create 10 pairs of questions and answers based on the given context about the University of Chicago. The output should be in CSV format with each line containing a question and the correct answer separated by a semicolon. 

First, I'll start by reading through the provided context carefully to understand the key points. The University of Chicago is a private research university located in Chicago, Illinois. It has several schools, including the Pritzker School of Medicine, Booth School of Business, Law School, and others. Notable alumni include Nobel laureates, prominent scholars, and influential figures across various fields.

Looking at the facts provided, there are many individuals who have affiliations with UChicago, either as alumni or faculty. The university also has a significant history in research, including contributions to nuclear physics and being associated with notable prizes and rankings.

I need to ensure that each question is unique and covers different aspects of the university. Let me brainstorm possible questions:

1. What type of institution is the University of Chicago? (private research university)
2. How many professional schools does it have? (seven)
3. Which school is known for business? (Booth School of Business)
4. Where was the first self-sustaining nuclear reaction achieved? (under Stagg Field at UChicago)
5. What's the name of the largest academic press in the US? (University of Chicago Press)
6. Who developed the first self-sustaining nuclear reaction? (Enrico Fermi, but maybe a more specific question about who helped develop it)
7. How many Nobel laureates are affiliated with UChicago? (98 as of 2018)
8. What is one of its notable alumni in economics? (Maybe Milton Friedman or someone else)
9. Which former President's center is hosted at UChicago? (Barack Obama)
10. What year was the Obama Presidential Center expected to be completed? (2021)

Wait, looking back at the examples provided, some questions are already there, so I should avoid duplicating them. Also, in the facts section, many individuals have affiliations, but it's a bit too detailed for each person.

I need to make sure that each question is unique and not repetitive. Let me structure them:

1. What type of university is the University of Chicago? Answer: uma universidade de pesquisa privada sem fins lucrativos.
2. How many professional schools does UChicago have? Answer: sete
3. Which school is known for business at UChicago? Answer: Escola de Negócios Booth
4. Under which field was the first self-sustaining nuclear reaction achieved? Answer: departamento de física
5. What's the name of the largest academic press in the US? Answer: University of Chicago Press
6. Which former president's center is hosted at UChicago? Answer: Barack Obama
7. How many Nobel laureates are connected with UChicago as of 2018? Answer: 98
8. What year was the Obama Presidential Center expected to be completed? Answer: 2021
9. Which school is known for law at UChicago? Answer: Faculdade de Direito
10. Under which field did the first self-sustaining nuclear reaction take place? Answer: Stagg Field

Wait, but in the examples provided, some of these are already present. So I need to adjust:

Looking back, the example questions include types of university, number of professional schools, divisions, number of students, development areas, who helped with the first nuclear reaction, location, press name, Obama center completion year.

So I should create new ones without repeating those topics. Let me think about other aspects:

- Notable alumni in specific fields
- Affiliated Nobel laureates count
- Specific research achievements beyond nuclear physics
- Specific programs or departments

Alternatively, since the facts list many individuals, maybe a question about a notable alumnus.

But I need to ensure that each question is answerable from the context. The facts section lists many people but not all are famous, so perhaps it's better to focus on known figures.

Wait, the context mentions that the university has produced many prominent alumni, including 53 Rhodes Scholars, etc. So a possible question: How many Rhodes Scholars have graduated from UChicago? Answer: 53.

Another point is the number of MacArthur Fellows: 34 faculty and 17 alumni.

Also, in the context, it's mentioned that UChicago has affiliations with several organizations, including the Association of American Universities. So a question about its academic affiliation could be: Which organization does UChicago belong to? Answer: Association of American Universities.

Another angle is the number of students: currently 5971 undergraduates and total around 30k, but the example already asks about the number of students, so maybe another figure.

Wait, in the context, it says "Quantas divisões de pesquisa acadêmica a Universidade de Chicago possui?;quatro" which translates to four academic research divisions. So perhaps a question about that: How many academic research divisions does UChicago have? Answer: quatro.

But looking at the example, this is already covered. So I need another one.

Maybe something about the university's ranking or reputation, but the context doesn't specify numbers on that.

Alternatively, specific programs: Pritzker School of Medicine for medicine, Booth for business, etc.

Wait, in the facts, many individuals are listed with their fields. For example, Fanghua Lin is a mathematician affiliated with UChicago. So perhaps a question about notable faculty or alumni in a specific field.

But without knowing who is most famous, it's tricky. Alternatively, since the context mentions that 98 Nobel laureates are affiliated, perhaps another question about that.

Wait, but I think I should aim for variety and avoid repetition with the examples given.

Let me try to structure ten unique questions:

1. What type of university is the University of Chicago? Answer: uma universidade de pesquisa privada sem fins lucrativos.
2. How many professional schools does it have? Answer: sete
3. Which school is known for business? Answer: Booth School of Business
4. Where was the first self-sustaining nuclear reaction achieved? Answer: under Stagg Field
5. What's the name of the largest academic press in the US? Answer: University of Chicago Press
6. How many Nobel laureates are connected with UChicago as of 2018? Answer: 98
7. When was the Obama Presidential Center expected to be completed? Answer: 2021
8. Which department developed the first self-sustaining nuclear reaction? Answer: departamento de física
9. How many Rhodes Scholars have graduated from UChicago? Answer: 53
10. Which organization is UChicago affiliated with? Answer: Association of American Universities

I think these cover different aspects without repeating the examples too much.
