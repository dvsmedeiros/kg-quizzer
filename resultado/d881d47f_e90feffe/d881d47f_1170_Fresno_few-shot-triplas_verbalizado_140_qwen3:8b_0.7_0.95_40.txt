Okay, I need to generate 10 CSV pairs based on the provided context and facts about Fresno, California. Let me start by understanding the context and the facts given.

The context says Fresno is the fifth most populous city in California, located in Fresno County, incorporated in 1885, with over 542k residents as of 2020. The facts include various people born or died in Fresno, sports teams based there, locations like Selland Arena, and other details like population density, area, and landmarks.

First, I should make sure each question is unique and covers different aspects. Let me list possible topics: population stats, incorporation date, notable people, sports teams, landmarks, geographic details, and other facts.

For example, the first question could be about the rank in population. Then, the incorporation year. Next, mention someone born there, like Chris McNealy. Then a sports team, like the 2015–16 Washington Huskies. Another could be about the population density. Maybe a landmark like Selland Arena. Also, the area in square kilometers. The United States District Court location. The population as of 2020. And the gentile term "Fresnan".

I need to ensure each answer is directly from the context. Let me check the facts again. For instance, the population as of 2020 is 542k. The incorporation date is 1885. The population density in mi² is 4722.6, and in km² 1823.43. The United States District Court is in Fresno. The gentile is Fresnan. Selland Arena is located there. The 2015–16 Washington Huskies team is based in Fresno. Chris McNealy was born there. The population metropolitan is 1,008,654. The area total is 300.43 km².

Wait, some numbers might be conflicting, like the area total vs. the area in km². The context mentions "área total (km²) 300.43" and "área terrestre 297304700.0" which seems like a typo, maybe 297,304.7 km². But the user provided the exact numbers, so I should use them as given.

Now, structuring the CSV pairs. Each question should be unique and cover different aspects. Let me make sure the answers are correct based on the facts provided. Avoid repeating similar questions. For example, one about population, another about incorporation date, another about a notable person, a sports team, a landmark, population density, the District Court location, the gentile term, and the metropolitan population.

I need to ensure the answers are exact. For example, the population as of 2020 is "mais de 542 mil habitantes". The incorporation date is "12 de outubro de 1885". Chris McNealy's birthplace is Fresno, California. The 2015–16 team is based there. Selland Arena is located there. Population density in mi² is 4722.6. The United States District Court is located there. Gentile is Fresnan. Metropolitan population is 1,008,654.

Wait, the facts mention "Fresno, California possui população metropolitana 1008654" which is 1,008,654. So that's the answer for the metropolitan population. Also, the area total is 300.43 km². The 2020 census population is "mais de 542 mil habitantes".

Let me compile these into 10 unique questions and answers, ensuring each answer is directly from the context. Avoid any repetition in the questions. For example, one about the population rank, another about incorporation date, a person born there, a sports team, a landmark, population density, the court location, the gentile term, the metropolitan population, and the area in km².
