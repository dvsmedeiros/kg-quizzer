Okay, I need to help the user generate a list of 10 pairs of "pergunta" and "resposta." They provided an HTML template with some data, which looks like a list of city names along with various properties or information.

First, I should extract each city name from the given HTML. The main div has two <img> tags that include the state abbreviation followed by "FL," so that's clear where the state is. Each city has several <img> tags pointing to their Wikipedia images, which might not be necessary for the pairs but are part of the data.

Next, I need to extract the text content from each image source tag. The user provided a snippet where the text includes "Jacksonville Civil WarLGHTBTTY.jpg" and others. These are the responses corresponding to each question (city names).

I should make sure that each city's text is paired with its correct abbreviation followed by "FL." So, the first pair would be "JACKSONville, FL" and "Jax_FL_Civil_War_LGHTBTTY.jpg," and so on for each city.

I also need to ensure that I get exactly 10 pairs. The provided HTML seems to have more than enough cities listed, but I'll check how many there are in the template snippet.

Finally, I should present this information clearly, possibly in a numbered list format as per the user's instructions.
