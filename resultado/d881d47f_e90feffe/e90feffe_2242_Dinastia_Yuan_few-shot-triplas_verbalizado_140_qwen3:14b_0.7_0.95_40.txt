Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the provided context and facts. Let me start by carefully reading through the given information to identify key points. 

The main context is about the Yuan Dynasty, founded by Kublai Khan, grandson of Genghis Khan, in 1271. The facts include various details like dates, related events, people, and other historical elements. 

First, I'll list out the key points from the context:
- Founded by Kublai Khan in 1271.
- Descendant of Genghis Khan.
- Official name is "Great Yuan."
- Capital cities: Khanbaliq and Shangdu.
- Ended in 1368.
- Related events: Mongol conquest of China, Red Turban Rebellion, Battle of Xiangyang.
- People associated: Kublai Khan, Temür Khan, Jayaatu Khan, Khutughtu Khan, etc.
- Other details: Use of certain Wikipedia templates, images, and categories.

Now, I need to form varied questions that cover different aspects. Let's brainstorm possible questions:

1. Who founded the Yuan Dynasty? (Answer: Kublai Khan)
2. In what year was the Yuan Dynasty established? (Answer: 1271)
3. What is the official name of the Yuan Dynasty? (Answer: Great Yuan)
4. Which dynasty followed the Yuan Dynasty? (Answer: Ming Dynasty)
5. What was the capital of the Yuan Dynasty? (Answer: Khanbaliq or Shangdu)
6. When did the Yuan Dynasty end? (Answer: 1368)
7. Who was the grandfather of Kublai Khan? (Answer: Genghis Khan)
8. What major event led to the fall of the Yuan Dynasty? (Answer: Red Turban Rebellion)
9. What is another name for the capital Khanbaliq? (Answer: Dadu)
10. Which event was significant during the Yuan Dynasty's rule? (Answer: Mongol conquest of China)

Now, I need to check the facts provided to ensure the answers are accurate. For example, the facts mention that the Yuan Dynasty was established in 1271, dissolved in 1368, and that Kublai Khan is the founder. Also, the capital is Khanbaliq (Dadu), and the Ming Dynasty followed. The Red Turban Rebellion is listed as an event related to the Yuan Dynasty.

I need to make sure each question is unique and covers different aspects. Also, avoid repeating similar questions. Let me structure them properly in CSV format, ensuring the separator is a semicolon and using Portuguese for both questions and answers.
