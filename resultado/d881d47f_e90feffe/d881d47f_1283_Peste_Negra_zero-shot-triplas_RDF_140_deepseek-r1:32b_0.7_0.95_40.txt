Okay, so I need to generate a CSV with 10 question-answer pairs based on the given context about the Black Death. Let me go through this step by step.

First, I'll read through the context provided to understand the key points. The Black Death was the most devastating pandemic in human history, causing between 75 million and 200 million deaths in Eurasia. It peaked in Europe from 1347 to 1351. The cause was Yersinia pestis bacteria, leading to three forms: septicemic, pneumonic, and bubonic (the most common). It's considered the first major European outbreak and the second pandemic.

The plague originated likely in Central or East Asia and spread via the Silk Road to Crimea by 1343. From there, it was transported by fleas on rats aboard Genoese merchant ships, spreading across the Mediterranean and then Europe through Italy. It killed 30-60% of Europe's population, reducing the world population from 475 million to around 350-375 million in the 14th century. Recovery took about 200 years in some areas, like Florence, which only recovered by the 19th century. Recurrences happened until the early 20th century.

Now, I need to create varied questions covering different aspects of this information without repeating similar ones. Each question should have a clear, single correct answer from the context.

Let me brainstorm possible questions:

1. What was the main cause of the Black Death?
   - Yersinia pestis bacteria

2. How many people did it kill in Eurasia?
   - 75 to 200 million

3. Which time period had the peak in Europe?
   - Between 1347 and 1351

4. What three forms did the plague take?
   - Septicemic, pneumonic, bubonic (most common)

5. How was it spread from Crimea to Europe?
   - Via fleas on rats on Genoese ships

6. What percentage of Europe's population died?
   - 30% to 60%

7. What was the impact on the world population in the 14th century?
   - Reduced from 475 million to 350-375 million

8. How long did it take for some regions to recover?
   - About 200 years (e.g., Florence by the 19th century)

9. When were there recurrences?
   - Until the early 20th century

10. What region was likely the origin?
    - Central or East Asia

I think these cover different aspects without overlapping too much. Now, I'll structure them into CSV format as specified.
