Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs based on the provided data about Fresno, California. Let me first look through the data to identify key facts and figures. 

First, there's the population information: populationMetro is 1008654. That's a good stat for a question. Then there's the population density, both in km and sq mi. The areaLand and areaTotal are given in numbers, but the areaTotalKm is 300.43 km². Also, the demonym is "Fresnan," which could be a question about the term used for residents.

Looking at the radio stations, there's KMGV with area Fresno, California. Maybe a question about the broadcast area. Also, the Selland Arena is located there, so that's another point. The United States District Court for the Eastern District of California is in Fresno, which could be a legal question.

The Wikipedia templates mention Template:USPopulousCities, which might relate to rankings. The population density in sq mi is 4722.6, which is quite high. The mapCaption says "Location within Fresno County," so a question about the county. Also, the areaTotalKm is 300.43, which is the total area. The demonym again is a good point.

I need to ensure that each question is unique and covers different aspects. Let me list possible questions:

1. What is the population of the Fresno metropolitan area?
2. What is the population density of Fresno in square miles?
3. Which radio station has Fresno, California as its broadcast area?
4. What is the total area of Fresno, California in square kilometers?
5. What is the demonym for residents of Fresno, California?
6. Which notable venue is located in Fresno, California?
7. What is the location of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of California?
8. What is the population density of Fresno in square kilometers?
9. Which county does Fresno, California belong to?
10. What is the total area of Fresno, California in square kilometers?

Wait, the areaTotalKm is 300.43, but areaLand is 297,304,700.0. Wait, that seems off. Wait, looking back, the data shows ns2:areaLand "297304700.0" and ns2:areaTotal "300430000.0" and ns1:areaTotalKm "300.43". So the areaTotalKm is in km², but the areaLand and areaTotal are in square meters? Because 297,304,700 square meters is 297.3 square kilometers. Wait, that might be a typo. Let me check the numbers again. 

The user might have made a mistake in the data entry. For example, areaLand is 297,304,700.0, which is 297,304.7 km² if converted, but that's not possible. Wait, maybe the numbers are in square meters. So 297,304,700 square meters is 297.3 km². Similarly, areaTotal is 300,430,000 square meters, which is 300.43 km². But the ns1:areaTotalKm is 300.43, which matches. So the areaTotalKm is 300.43 km². So the total area is 300.43 km². 

So for the questions about area, I should use the areaTotalKm. 

So revising the questions:

4. What is the total area of Fresno, California in square kilometers?
10. What is the total area of Fresno, California in square kilometers? Wait, that's the same. Maybe rephrase.

Alternatively, question 4 could be about areaLand in square kilometers, but since areaLand is 297,304,700 square meters, which is 297.3 km². But the data has areaTotalKm as 300.43, so perhaps that's the total area. 

So maybe the questions should be:

4. What is the total area of Fresno, California in square kilometers?
10. What is the area of Fresno, California in square kilometers? (But that's the same as 4.)

Alternatively, maybe the areaLand and areaTotal are different. Let me check again.

The data has:

ns2:areaLand "297304700.0" 
ns2:areaTotal "300430000.0" 
ns1:areaTotalKm "300.43" 

So areaLand is 297,304,700 square meters (which is 297.3 km²), areaTotal is 300,430,000 square meters (300.43 km²). So the total area is 300.43 km². 

So for the questions, I can use the areaTotalKm. 

So the 10 questions would be:

1. What is the population of the Fresno metropolitan area? 
2. What is the population density of Fresno in square miles? 
3. Which radio station has Fresno, California as its broadcast area? 
4. What is the total area of Fresno, California in square kilometers? 
5. What is the demonym for residents of Fresno, California? 
6. Which notable venue is located in Fresno, California? 
7. What is the location of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of California? 
8. What is the population density of Fresno in square kilometers? 
9. Which county does Fresno, California belong to? 
10. What is the total area of Fresno, California in square kilometers? 

Wait, questions 4 and 10 are the same. Need to adjust. Maybe question 8 is about population density in square kilometers, which is 1823.43. 

So the 10 questions would be:

1. What is the population of the Fresno metropolitan area? 
2. What is the population density of Fresno in square miles? 
3. Which radio station has Fresno, California as its broadcast area? 
4. What is the total area of Fresno, California in square kilometers? 
5. What is the demonym for residents of Fresno, California? 
6. Which notable venue is located in Fresno, California? 
7. What is the location of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of California? 
8. What is the population density of Fresno in square kilometers? 
9. Which county does Fresno, California belong to? 
10. What is the name of the radio station that broadcasts in Fresno, California? 

But question 10 is similar to question 3. Maybe rephrase. 

Alternatively, use different aspects. For example, the Selland Arena is a venue, so question 6 is about that. The United States District Court is in Fresno, so question 7. 

I think that's manageable. Now, compiling the answers based on the data.
