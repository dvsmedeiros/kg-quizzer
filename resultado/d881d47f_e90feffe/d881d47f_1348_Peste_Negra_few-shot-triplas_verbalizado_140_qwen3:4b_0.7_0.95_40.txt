Okay, the user wants me to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the provided context and facts about the Black Death. Let me start by carefully reading through the context and facts to make sure I understand all the key points.

First, the Black Death is a pandemic that killed 75-200 million people in Eurasia, peaked in Europe between 1347-1351. The cause is Yersinia pestis, leading to bubonic, septicemic, and pneumonic plague. It originated in Central or Eastern Asia, spread via the Silk Road to Crimea, then to Europe via Genoese merchants on ships. It killed 30-60% of Europe's population, reducing the world population from 475 million to 350-375 million. Recovery in Europe took 200 years, with some areas like Florence recovering in the 19th century. It returned as outbreaks until the early 20th century.

Looking at the facts, there are several points to cover: origin, spread path, impact on Europe, population reduction, recovery time, transmission method (fleas on rats), cause (Yersinia pestis), historical sources, and some specific details like the quote from Geoffrey the Baker. Also, there are images and other tags, but the questions should be based on the content provided.

Now, I need to create 10 unique questions. Let me brainstorm possible questions:

1. Origin of the Black Death: Asia Central or Eastern Asia.
2. How it spread to the Mediterranean and Europe: Genoese ships with rats.
3. Percentage of Europe's population killed: 30-60%.
4. When did the world population recover: 200 years after the peak.
5. Transmission method: fleas on rats.
6. The main cause: Yersinia pestis.
7. Historical source: Geoffrey the Baker's Chronicon Angliae.
8. The quote about England: "scarcely the tenth person... left alive."
9. The primary vector: Oriental rat flea.
10. The first major outbreak in Europe: 1347-1351.

Wait, but the user provided examples, so I should ensure that the questions are not repeated. The examples include origin, spread, percentage, recovery time, duration, etc. So I need to make sure the new questions are different. Let me check the facts again to find more specific points.

Looking at the facts, there's a mention of the plague's origin in Central or Eastern Asia, spread via the Silk Road to Crimea, then through Genoese ships. Also, the plague was called "Black Death" as a result of the blackened skin of the buboes. The disease is also known as bubonic plague. The quote from Geoffrey the Baker is about England's population. The plague's impact on Europe's population, and the recovery time. Also, the specific mention of the Oriental rat flea being the primary vector. The fact that it was the second pandemic of the plague. The date of the start (1346), and the spread in Europe in the 1340s and 1350s.

Another point: the plague was called "Black Death" because of the blackened skin. The images and legends mentioned, like the Oriental rat flea's role. The fact that it killed 75-200 million people. The time period of the pandemic (1346-1353). The effect on the world population. The different forms of the plague. The role of the fleas in transmission. The quote from Geoffrey the Baker.

I need to make sure each question is distinct. Let me try to list 10:

1. Where did the Black Death originate? (Asia Central or Eastern Asia)
2. How did the Black Death spread to the Mediterranean and Europe? (Genoese ships with rats)
3. What percentage of Europe's population was killed by the Black Death? (30-60%)
4. How long did it take for Europe to recover from the Black Death? (200 years)
5. What is the primary vector for the transmission of the Black Death? (Oriental rat flea)
6. What is the main cause of the Black Death? (Yersinia pestis)
7. Which historical source mentions the impact of the Black Death in England? (Geoffrey the Baker's Chronicon Angliae)
8. What is the name of the disease caused by the Black Death? (Bubonic plague)
9. What was the estimated world population before and after the Black Death? (475 million to 350-375 million)
10. What was the time period of the Black Death pandemic? (1346-1353)

Wait, but the user's examples included questions like "What is the name of the disease caused by the Black Death?" which is correct. Also, the quote from Geoffrey the Baker is a specific example. Also, the fact that the Black Death was called "Black Death" because of the blackened skin. But the user's examples included that. However, the user's instructions say to generate based on the provided facts, so I should check if the facts include that.

Looking back at the context: "Acredita-se que a bactéria Yersinia pestis, que resulta em várias formas de peste (septicémica, pneumónica e, a mais comum, bubónica), tenha sido a causa. A Peste Negra foi o primeiro grande surto europeu de peste e a segunda pandemia da doença. A praga criou uma série de convulsões religiosas, sociais e econômicas." So the Black Death is the bubonic plague. Also, the name "Black Death" comes from the blackened skin of the buboes.

So, maybe another question: What is the name of the disease caused by the Black Death? (Bubonic plague). But the user's example already includes that. However, the user's example is from their own example, but the user's instruction says to generate based on the facts. So, the user's example includes that.

Alternatively, the question could be: What is the name of the disease that the Black Death caused? (Bubonic plague). But that's redundant. Maybe the user wants to avoid repetition.

Alternatively, the question could be: Why is the Black Death called "Black Death"? (Because of the blackened skin of the buboes).

But in the user's examples, they have that: "O que significa uma doença ser enzoótica?;eralmente presente)" which is not related. But in the user's example, they have "De onde se originou a morte negra?;as planícies da Ásia Central," which is about origin.

So, I need to make sure that the questions are based on the given facts. Let me check the facts again to find 10 distinct points.

Other points: the Black Death is the second pandemic of the plague. The plague killed 75-200 million people. The quote from Geoffrey the Baker mentions England's population. The time period of the pandemic (1346-1353). The impact on Europe's population. The role of the Oriental rat flea. The term "Black Death" comes from the blackened skin. The fact that it was the first major outbreak in Europe. The recovery time in Europe. The spread path.

So, compiling 10 questions:

1. Where did the Black Death originate? (Asia Central or Eastern Asia)
2. How did the Black Death spread to the Mediterranean and Europe? (Genoese ships with rats)
3. What percentage of Europe's population was killed by the Black Death? (30-60%)
4. How long did it take for Europe to recover from the Black Death? (200 years)
5. What is the primary vector for the transmission of the Black Death? (Oriental rat flea)
6. What is the main cause of the Black Death? (Yersinia pestis)
7. Which historical source mentions the impact of the Black Death in England? (Geoffrey the Baker's Chronicon Angliae)
8. What is the name of the disease caused by the Black Death? (Bubonic plague)
9. What was the estimated world population before and after the Black Death? (475 million to 350-375 million)
10. What was the time period of the Black Death pandemic? (1346-1353)

That's 10. Now, I need to check if these are all covered in the facts. The user's example included questions like origin, spread, percentage, recovery time, transmission vector, cause, historical source, disease name, world population, and time period. These seem to be covered. The answer for the world population is in the context: "reducing the world population from 475 million to 350-375 million." The time period is mentioned as "peaked in Europe between 1347-1351" but the fact says "the Black Death... spread in the 1340s and 1350s." Also, the data from the facts says "the Black Death... started in April 2020" but that's a mistake in the facts, maybe a typo. Wait, looking back at the facts, there's a line: "Black Death possui data April 2020". That seems like an error. Maybe it's a mistake, but the user's context says the Black Death peaked between 1347-1351, so the time period is 1346-1353. The user's example includes "Quando começou a fome chinesa?;1331," but that's about the Chinese famine, not the Black Death.

So, the answer for the time period would be 1346-1353, as per the facts. But the user's facts mention "Black Death possui data April 2020" which is probably a mistake, but the correct time is 1346-1353.

Therefore, the 10 questions and answers should be as above.
