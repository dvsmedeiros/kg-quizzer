Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the provided context and facts about the Yuan Dynasty. Let me start by understanding the context and the facts given.

The Yuan Dynasty was founded by Kublai Khan, a descendant of Genghis Khan. It was established in 1271 and lasted until 1368. The dynasty was based in China, with its capital in Khanbaliq. The facts mention various events, people, and locations related to the Yuan Dynasty, such as battles, historical events, and key figures.

Now, I need to create 10 distinct questions that cover different aspects of the Yuan Dynasty. The questions should be in Portuguese, with one correct answer each, and based solely on the provided information. Let me list possible questions and their answers:

1. **Who founded the Yuan Dynasty?** Answer: Kublai Khan.
2. **In which year was the Yuan Dynasty established?** Answer: 1271.
3. **What is the capital of the Yuan Dynasty?** Answer: Khanbaliq.
4. **Which empire did the Yuan Dynasty originate from?** Answer: Mongol Empire.
5. **What is the official name of the Yuan Dynasty in Chinese?** Answer: Dà Yuán.
6. **Who was the predecessor of the Yuan Dynasty?** Answer: Song Dynasty.
7. **What was the name of the dynasty that came after the Yuan Dynasty?** Answer: Ming Dynasty.
8. **What was the title of the Yuan Dynasty in Mongolian script?** Answer: "Dà Yuán Dà Měnggū Guó".
9. **What was the name of the calendar used during the Yuan Dynasty?** Answer: "Time Granting Calendar".
10. **Which battle marked the end of the Yuan Dynasty?** Answer: Fall of Khanbaliq.

I need to check if these questions are covered in the provided facts. The facts do mention the establishment year, the capital, the predecessor and successor dynasties, the official name, the calendar, and the fall of Khanbaliq. The answer about the predecessor and successor dynasties is covered in the facts under "s" and "t" fields. Also, the title in Mongolian script is listed under "t" as "Dà Yuán Dà Měnggū Guó".

Now, I should format these into the required CSV format, ensuring the answers are correctly matched and in Portuguese. Let me make sure each question is unique and based on the given information without adding any external knowledge. Also, check for any possible duplicates or overlaps. Once confirmed, the 10 pairs should be ready.
