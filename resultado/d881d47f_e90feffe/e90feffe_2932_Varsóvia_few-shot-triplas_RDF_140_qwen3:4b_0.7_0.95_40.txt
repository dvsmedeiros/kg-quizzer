Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs based on the given data about Warsaw. Let me start by understanding the information provided.

First, there's a lot of data about Warsaw, including its classification as a city in Masovian Voivodeship, some weather statistics like record high temperature, precipitation, humidity, etc. Also, there are mentions of notable places, events, and organizations related to Warsaw. The examples given include questions about the largest city in Poland, the river it's located by, distance from the Baltic Sea, population of the largest metropolitan area, and other related facts.

I need to come up with 10 different questions that can be answered using the provided data. Let me check the data again to see what's available. The data includes:

- Warsaw is the capital of Poland.
- It's located near the Vistula River.
- Distance from the Baltic Sea is about 260 km.
- The largest metropolitan area has 2.666 million residents.
- Warsaw was ranked 32nd most livable city in 2012.
- Economy is characterized by a variety of industries.
- Research is a key intercambio (interchange) for Central and Eastern Europe.
- Frontex is the EU agency for external border security.

Also, there are mentions of specific places like the Warszawa Żerań railway station, Stadion Dziesięciolecia, Sigismund's Column, etc.

Let me think of possible questions:

1. What is the capital of Poland? (Answer: Warsaw)
2. Which river is near Warsaw? (Vistula)
3. How far is Warsaw from the Baltic Sea? (About 260 km)
4. What is the population of the largest metropolitan area in Poland? (2.666 million)
5. When was Warsaw ranked as the 32nd most livable city? (2012)
6. What is the main economic characteristic of Warsaw? (Varied industries)
7. What is a key research exchange in Central and Eastern Europe? (Research)
8. What is the name of the EU agency for border security? (Frontex)
9. What is the name of the railway station in Warsaw? (Warszawa Żerań)
10. What is the motto of Warsaw? (Semper invicta)

Wait, the data mentions the motto as "Semper invicta", so that's a valid question. Also, the data has a note about the 32nd most livable city in 2012. The examples include questions about the largest city, river, distance, population, and the 32nd ranking.

I need to make sure the answers are accurate based on the data provided. Let me check each point again.

Yes, the data includes the motto, the river, the distance, the population, the ranking, the economy, the Frontex agency, and the railway station. The 10 questions should cover these aspects. I think that's all. Let me structure them as per the examples.
