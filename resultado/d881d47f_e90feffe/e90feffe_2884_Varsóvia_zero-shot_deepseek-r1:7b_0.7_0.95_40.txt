Okay, I need to generate a quiz based on the given context about Warsaw. The user wants exactly 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format. Let me think of various aspects related to Warsaw that I can cover.

First, I'll consider historical facts—maybe something like when Warsaw was founded. I know it was founded in 1923 under Soviet rule after being dissolved by Napoleon.

Next, landmarks are a good topic. The historic Old Town Square is called square Malé Schcety, so I can ask its name.

Cultural aspects could include famous museums. The National Museum of Art is one, and it's located at ul. Jazzyka. That's specific enough for a question.

For geography, I remember Warsaw is the capital of Poland, so that's straightforward.

Transportation-wise, buses are a common mode; perhaps the number 29 is well-known. Also, Mazdprs is a modern bus company in the city.

Religion is interesting too. Warsaw has been home to several churches, including St. Anne's which was built in 1635.

Natural features like parks—Ochota Park comes to mind, and it's known for its railway station.

Economically, Gdansk is a significant port, so that makes a good question about its role as Europe's largest deepwater port.

Cultural institutions, the Philharmonic Orchestra performs there, and their famous composer was Beethoven.

Lastly, Polish culture includes traditional dishes. Pie or Trefrywka comes to mind as a popular choice.

I think these cover a range of topics related to Warsaw without repeating similar questions.
