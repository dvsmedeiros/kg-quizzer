Okay, I need to generate 10 objective questions and answers based on the provided context and facts. Let me start by understanding the content.

The context talks about the European Union's laws, their purpose, institutions, and the legal framework. The facts mention specific entities and individuals related to the Law of the European Union, like John Bell, Common Market Law Review, and Henry G. Schermers. Also, there are mentions of wiki templates used for the topic.

First, I should make sure the questions cover different aspects: maybe the main topic, the purpose, institutions, related disciplines, individuals involved, and the structure (like wiki templates). I need to avoid repetition and ensure each question is unique.

Let me list possible questions:

1. What is the main topic of the Law of the European Union?
2. What is the purpose of the European Union according to the context?
3. Which institution is mentioned as acting in the discipline of Law of the European Union?
4. Who is a legal scholar mentioned in the context related to Law of the European Union?
5. What is the role of the European Union's institutions?
6. What is the primary goal of the European Union as stated in the context?
7. Which entity is associated with the discipline of Law of the European Union?
8. What is the term used for the legal framework of the European Union?
9. What is the function of the European Union's judicial system?
10. Which subdiscipline is mentioned in relation to Law of the European Union?

Wait, some of these might be similar. Let me check the facts again. The facts mention Law of the European Union as the main topic, John Bell, Common Market Law Review, Henry G. Schermers as a subdiscipline, and the use of certain wiki templates. Also, the purpose is promoting peace, values, and well-being of its people.

So, I can structure the questions around these points. Need to ensure each question is distinct. For example, the first question is about the main topic, the second about the purpose, the third about the institution (Common Market Law Review), the fourth about the scholar (John Bell), the fifth about the role of institutions, the sixth about the primary goal, the seventh about the subdiscipline (Henry G. Schermers), the eighth about the term used (laws), the ninth about the judicial system (Tribunal de Justiça), and the tenth about the wiki templates.

Wait, the context mentions the Tribunal de Justiça as part of the EU's institutions. Also, the use of specific wiki templates like Template:Redirect category shell, etc. So maybe include a question about those templates.

Hmm, but the user said "exclusivamente a partir do conteúdo fornecido." So I need to make sure all answers are based on the given facts. Let me check again.

The facts include:

- Law of the European Union is the main topic.
- John Bell is a legal scholar in this area.
- Common Market Law Review is in the discipline.
- Henry G. Schermers is a subdiscipline.
- The EU uses certain wiki templates.

So, the questions can be:

1. What is the main topic of the Law of the European Union?
2. What is the purpose of the European Union according to the context?
3. Which entity is associated with the discipline of Law of the European Union?
4. Who is a legal scholar mentioned in the context related to Law of the European Union?
5. What is the role of the European Union's institutions?
6. What is the primary goal of the European Union as stated in the context?
7. Which subdiscipline is mentioned in relation to Law of the European Union?
8. What is the term used for the legal framework of the European Union?
9. What is the function of the European Union's judicial system?
10. What wiki templates are used for the Law of the European Union?

Yes, that's 10. Now, I need to make sure each answer is correct based on the context. For example, the answer to question 2 is "promover a paz, seus valores e o bem-estar de seus povos." Question 3: Common Market Law Review. Question 4: John Bell. Question 7: Henry G. Schermers. Question 8: Law of the European Union. Question 9: the Tribunal de Justiça. Question 10: the specific templates like Template:Redirect category shell, etc.

I need to check that all answers are accurate and that the questions are distinct. Also, the user wants the CSV format with each pair separated by a semicolon. Let me structure them properly.
