Okay, I need to generate 10 pairs of questions and answers based on the provided context and facts about Jacksonville, Florida. Let me start by reviewing the context and facts to ensure I cover different aspects.

First, the context mentions Jacksonville is the most populous city in Florida, located in Duval County. It's the third largest on the East Coast, 12th in the US with 950k population in 2020. Founded in 1791, incorporated in 1832. Located along the St. Johns River, near Georgia and Miami. Originally inhabited by Timucua, site of Fort Caroline, and named after Andrew Jackson.

The facts list a bunch of specific data points, like temperature records, events, people born or died there, sports teams, landmarks, etc. I need to make sure each question is unique and covers different aspects. Let me check for variety.

Possible angles: population ranking, historical facts, geographical features, notable events, people associated, sports teams, landmarks, temperature records.

Let me start drafting questions:

1. What is the population of Jacksonville according to the 2020 census? Answer: quase 950 mil habitantes.

Wait, the context says "com uma população de quase 950 mil habitantes, de acordo com o censo nacional de 2020." So the answer should be "quase 950 mil" or "950 mil" but the exact wording from context is "quase 950 mil."

2. What is the rank of Jacksonville in the US by population? Answer: 12ª.

3. Which river flows along Jacksonville? Answer: St. Johns.

4. What is the name of the French colony established in 1564? Answer: Fort Caroline.

5. Who was Jacksonville named after? Answer: Andrew Jackson.

6. What is the area of Jacksonville in square feet? The context says "área terrestre 1935498000.0" but that's in square feet? Wait, the fact says "Jacksonville, Florida possui área terrestre 1935498000.0". But the user might expect the answer as "1.935.498.000" or "1935498000.0" but need to check if that's correct. However, the context doesn't mention the unit, but the fact says "área terrestre" which is land area. Maybe the answer is "1.935.498.000" or "1935498000.0" as per the fact.

Wait, but the user's example had "1.345.596" for population in 2010. So maybe format numbers with periods as thousand separators. But the fact says "1935498000.0" which is 1,935,498,000. But the user's example used "1.345.596" which is 1,345,596. So maybe the answer should be "1.935.498.000" but the fact has it as "1935498000.0". Hmm, but the user's instruction says to generate from the content. So the answer would be "1935498000.0" or formatted as "1.935.498.000"? The user's example used "1.345.596" which is the same as 1,345,596. So maybe the answer should be "1.935.498.000".

But I need to check if that's correct. The fact says "área terrestre 1935498000.0" which is 1,935,498,000 square feet? Or maybe it's in square meters? But the user's example used "1.345.596" which is population. So maybe the answer is "1935498000.0" as per the fact.

But the user's instruction says to use the content provided. So I have to take it as is. So the answer would be "1935498000.0".

But maybe the user expects the number in a different format. However, since the fact is written as "1935498000.0", I'll use that.

7. What is the record high temperature in December in Jacksonville? Answer: 85°F (from "recorde de temperatura alta em dezembro (°F) 85").

8. What is the record low temperature in February? Answer: 10°F (from "recorde de temperatura baixa em fevereiro (°F) 10").

9. What is the name of the sports team based in Jacksonville? Answer: Jacksonville Jaguars (from "Jacksonville Jaguars possui cidade Jacksonville, Florida").

10. What is the official name of Jacksonville? Answer: City of Jacksonville and Duval County (from "nome oficial City of Jacksonville and Duval County").

Wait, but the user's example had "Jacksonville" as the answer for the first question. So I need to make sure that the questions are clear and the answers are directly from the content.

Let me check if I have 10 unique questions. Let me list them:

1. What is the population of Jacksonville according to the 2020 census? Answer: quase 950 mil habitantes.

2. What is the rank of Jacksonville in the US by population? Answer: 12ª.

3. Which river flows along Jacksonville? Answer: St. Johns.

4. What was the name of the French colony established in 1564? Answer: Fort Caroline.

5. Who is Jacksonville named after? Answer: Andrew Jackson.

6. What is the land area of Jacksonville? Answer: 1935498000.0.

7. What is the record high temperature in December in Jacksonville? Answer: 85°F.

8. What is the record low temperature in February in Jacksonville? Answer: 10°F.

9. What is the name of the NFL team based in Jacksonville? Answer: Jacksonville Jaguars.

10. What is the official name of Jacksonville? Answer: City of Jacksonville and Duval County.

That's 10. Now, check if any of these are duplicates or if the answers are correctly taken from the content. Also, make sure the questions are in Portuguese as per the examples.

Yes, the examples are in Portuguese. So the questions should be in Portuguese. Let me adjust:

1. Qual é a população de Jacksonville de acordo com o censo de 2020?;quase 950 mil habitantes.

2. Qual é o ranking de Jacksonville nos Estados Unidos em termos de população?;12ª.

3. Qual rio passa ao lado de Jacksonville?;St. Johns.

4. Qual era o nome da colônia francesa fundada em 1564?;Fort Caroline.

5. Em homenagem a quem Jacksonville recebeu seu nome?;Andrew Jackson.

6. Qual é a área terrestre de Jacksonville?;1935498000.0.

7. Qual é o recorde de temperatura alta em dezembro em Jacksonville?;85°F.

8. Qual é o recorde de temperatura baixa em fevereiro em Jacksonville?;10°F.

9. Qual é o nome do time de futebol americano baseado em Jacksonville?;Jacksonville Jaguars.

10. Qual é o nome oficial de Jacksonville?;City of Jacksonville and Duval County.

Check if the answers are correctly from the content. For example, the area is 1935498000.0 as per the fact. The temperature records are in the facts. The NFL team is mentioned in the facts. The official name is in the facts.

Yes, that should work. Now, ensure that the questions are clear and the answers are accurate. Avoid any markdown, just plain text. Also, ensure that the answers are exactly as per the content, including units if any. For example, the temperature records have "°F" in the facts, so include that in the answer.
