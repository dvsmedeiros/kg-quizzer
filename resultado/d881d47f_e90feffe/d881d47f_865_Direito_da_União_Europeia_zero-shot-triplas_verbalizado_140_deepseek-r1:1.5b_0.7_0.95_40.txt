Okay, so I need to create a quiz based on the provided context and facts. The user mentioned that each question should be different in scope and relate to various aspects of the EU laws. They also emphasized that each response should be clear and directly related to the given information.

First, I'll start by carefully reading through the context again. The main points are about the EU's role as a common market, the involvement of John Bell, and the fact about Henry G. Schermers within the legal framework. There's some repetition in the facts but that might just be consistent content.

Next, I need to think about different aspects or issues related to EU laws. I'll brainstorm areas like the Common Market Law, jurisdictional issues, international relations, and perhaps a bit of GDPR since it's a significant EU law item. Let me check if there are any other facts that could tie into specific legal rules beyond what's already provided.

I realize that "John Bell (legal scholar)" is mentioned but not in a way that suggests a particular EU law. Maybe I can include another fact related to EU laws, but it seems like the main focus is on the Common Market Law and its implications. So perhaps focusing on jurisdiction issues or international trade would be better.

Now, considering each question needs to have only one correct answer, I'll make sure each response is explicit or inferred from the given facts. For example, if a question refers to John Bell's involvement in an EU case, the correct answer could state his role or contribution, which might not be explicitly stated but implied.

I should also ensure that there are no repeated questions and that all responses are clear. Maybe I can create 10 different scenarios where each involves some aspect of EU legal principles, ensuring each response is distinct and covers a unique point from the facts provided.

Finally, I'll structure each entry with "pergunta" followed by the question, then the "resposta" as the answer to that question. Each should be separated by a semicolon and within their own line in the CSV format.
