Okay, let's see. The user wants me to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the provided context and facts. The context is about the 1973 oil crisis, so I need to make sure the questions are relevant to that.

First, I'll read through the context again. The crisis started in October 1973 when OPEC imposed an embargo on countries supporting Israel during the Yom Kippur War. The targeted countries were Canada, Japan, the Netherlands, the UK, and the US, later expanding to Portugal, Rhodesia, and South Africa. The oil price went from $3 to $12 per barrel by March 1974, with even higher prices in the US. It's called the first oil shock, followed by the 1979 crisis.

Looking at the facts, there's a lot of metadata like categories, templates, images, etc. But the user emphasized that questions should be based on the context and not the technical facts like templates or image names. So I should focus on the main events, causes, effects, and key figures mentioned in the context.

Now, I need to create varied questions. Let's brainstorm possible topics: when the embargo started, who imposed it, which countries were affected, the price change, the term "first oil shock," the duration of the embargo, the impact on the US, the reason for the embargo, the effects on the global economy, and the subsequent second oil shock in 1979.

I should check that each question has a unique answer from the context. For example, the embargo was by OPEC members, the targeted countries, the price increase, the time period of the embargo, the term used, the reason related to the Yom Kippur War, the impact on the US prices, the subsequent crisis in 1979, and the global economic effects.

I need to avoid repeating similar questions. Let me make sure each question is distinct. Also, the answers must be directly from the context or inferable. For instance, the answer to "Quando foi levantado o embargo?" is March 1974, which is in the context. The price in the US was higher than the global average, so that's a good point.

I should structure the CSV correctly with semicolons and ensure no markdown is used. Let me list out the 10 questions and answers now, making sure they are all unique and based on the given context.
