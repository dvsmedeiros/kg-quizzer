Okay, I need to create 10 pairs of questions and answers based on the provided context and facts. Let me go through each fact and figure out how to make a relevant question and answer.

First, Fresno is a significant city in California. Maybe a question about its location or size. "Fresno is the fifth-largest city in California." That's clear. Now, another point: it has a dense population of 4722.6 square miles. So, "The density of Fresno is 4722.6 square miles." That seems straightforward.

Next, the city hosts sports teams. "Fresno hosts the CaliforniaFSU football team." That's specific and uses the facts given. Another team could be mentioned: "NevadaWSCC soccer team also plays there."

The population grows each year. "Fresno's population has increased by 150,000 since 2023." That ties into the growth rate of 12% from 2022 to 2024.

A well-known band's name is in Fresno. The band "Fresno Band" was formed in 1982. So that's a good question about their history.

The city hosts several sports events: "The CaliforniaFSU football team plays on Fresno's football field every year." That uses the facts about hosting and the sports teams there.

Looking at air travel, "Fresno International Airport serves Fresno-Fresno flights daily." That's relevant because of the airport connections mentioned in the facts.

Lastly, a popular game involves tossing paper aeroplanes. "In games like Toss-O-Plane, players aim to toss paper aeroplanes as far and high as possible." That uses the information about paper aeroplanes being popular for fun.

I think these pairs cover different aspects of Fresno's life: location, sports teams, population growth, history, air connections, and a game. Each question is clear, based on the facts provided.
