Okay, so I need to create 10 pairs of questions and answers based on the provided context about Warsaw. The user wants these in CSV format with each line being "pergunta;resposta". Let me first read through the context carefully to understand what information is available.

The context gives a lot of details about Warsaw: it's the capital of Poland, located on the Vistula river, historical background, notable buildings like the Sigismund Column and Barbacã, its status as a phoenix city after WWII, economic aspects, cultural institutions, and some specific facts about people born or died there, along with events related to the city.

Looking at the "Fatos" section, there are many entries about individuals who were born or died in Warsaw, sports events located there, organizations based there, and geographical features. I should focus on extracting key points from these facts to form varied questions.

I need to make sure each question is unique and covers different aspects: history, culture, geography, notable people, economy, etc. Also, the answers must be directly supported by the information given.

Let me start brainstorming possible questions:

1. What is Warsaw's nickname related to its rebirth? (Phoenix City)
2. Which river flows through Warsaw? (Vistula)
3. What is the population of Warsaw as of 2012? (Around 1,716,855)
4. Name a famous person born in Warsaw. (Could be Sigismund, but looking at facts: Ida Nowakowska, Stanisław Mazur, etc.)
5. What is the main attraction in the Old Town? (Sigismund's Column, Barbacã, Royal Castle)
6. Which organization is based in Warsaw? (Frontex, PTKiS, Polsat, etc.)
7. When did Warsaw get its "Phoenix City" title? (After WWII reconstruction)
8. What event occurred in the Warsaw Ghetto during WWII? (The Uprising of 1943)
9. Name a football club based in Warsaw. (Legia Warsaw, Pablopavo)
10. What is Warsaw's climate like? (Average rainfall, humidity, temperatures mentioned)

I need to check if these are covered in the facts. For example, the population figure is given, the river is Vistula, the nickname is Phoenix City, Frontex is based there, etc.

Wait, I should ensure each question has a unique and correct answer from the context. Let me go through each point again.

1. Warsaw's nickname: The text mentions it's called the "Phoenix City" because of its reconstruction after WWII.
2. River: Vistula is clearly stated.
3. Population: 1,716,855 in 2012.
4. Person born: From the facts, many were born there; maybe pick one like Ida Nowakowska or Weronika Kordowiecka.
5. Main attraction: The Old Town with Sigismund's Column and Barbacã are mentioned as key attractions.
6. Organization: Frontex is the EU border agency based in Warsaw.
7. Phoenix City title: It was after WWII, post-reconstruction.
8. Event in Ghetto: The 1943 Uprising.
9. Football club: Legia Warsaw is a major team, and the facts mention 2014–15 Polish football had a stadium in Warsaw.
10. Climate: The facts provide specific data like precipitation, humidity, and temperature records.

I think these points cover various aspects without overlapping. Now, I'll structure each as a question with the correct answer from the context.
