Okay, I need to generate 10 pairs of questions and answers based on the provided context and facts about British Satellite Broadcasting. Let me start by understanding the key points from the context and facts.

First, the company was established in 1986, founded on December 11, 1986. It was incorporated in November 1990 to form BSkyB. It started transmitting in March 1990. It's located in London, specifically at Marco Polo House. They have several TV channels like The Movie Channel, The Power Station, Galaxy, Now, and The Computer Channel. They produced films like Hardware and Memphis Belle. They were a direct broadcast satellite service, part of Sky Group, and eventually merged with Sky Television to form BSkyB. They have a logo and images associated with them, and they are categorized under various categories like British companies, mass media companies, etc.

Now, I need to create 10 unique questions that cover different aspects. Let me list possible topics: founding date, location, channels they own, production of films, merger, categories, types of entities, and their relation to other companies.

I should make sure each question is distinct. For example, one question about the founding date, another about the location, another about the merger, another about the channels, another about the films they produced, another about their categories, another about their entity types, another about the TV channels they own, another about their image, and another about their relation to Sky Group.

Wait, but I need to check if all the facts are covered. Let me go through the facts again. The company was founded in 1986, located in London, Marco Polo House. They have several TV channels. They produced certain films. They merged with Sky Television to form BSkyB. They are part of Sky Group. They have various categories and types like Company, Organization, etc.

So, possible questions:

1. When was British Satellite Broadcasting founded?
2. Where is British Satellite Broadcasting located?
3. Which TV channels are owned by British Satellite Broadcasting?
4. What films were produced by British Satellite Broadcasting?
5. What happened to British Satellite Broadcasting after its founding?
6. What is the category of British Satellite Broadcasting?
7. What type of entity is British Satellite Broadcasting?
8. What is the name of the logo associated with British Satellite Broadcasting?
9. What is the relationship between British Satellite Broadcasting and Sky Group?
10. In which year did British Satellite Broadcasting start transmitting?

Wait, but some of these might be overlapping. Let me check if each question is unique and based on the facts. For example, the location is Marco Polo House in London. The TV channels include The Movie Channel, The Power Station, Galaxy, Now, The Computer Channel. The films are Hardware and Memphis Belle. The merger is with Sky Television to form BSkyB. The category is Sky Group. The entity types include Company, Organization, etc.

I need to make sure each question is distinct and the answers are correct based on the facts provided. Let me structure them one by one, ensuring each is unique and covers different aspects.
