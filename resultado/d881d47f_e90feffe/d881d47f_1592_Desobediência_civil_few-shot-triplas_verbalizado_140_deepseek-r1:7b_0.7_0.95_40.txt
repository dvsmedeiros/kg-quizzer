First, I'll review the context again: Civil disobedience is a peaceful form of protest against injustice or unfair laws. It's mentioned in historical events like Gandhi's India independence march and Thoreau's work. There are various examples provided, such as protests in different countries utilizing this method.

- Civil disobedience is used by groups like Mahatma Gandhi and Tony Milligan.
- It's applied in protests against corruption (e.g., 2019 Montenegrin anti-corruption protests).
- Thoreau's ideas are notable, and Gandhi has links to his work.
- Specific events: 1998 Russian miners' strike, 2017 Serbian protests, 2015–2016 Montenegrin crisis.

I'll start by creating questions based on these facts:

I need to ensure each question is unique, covers different aspects, and the answers are correct based on the provided facts. Also, I'll make sure there's no repetition of topics or sources.
