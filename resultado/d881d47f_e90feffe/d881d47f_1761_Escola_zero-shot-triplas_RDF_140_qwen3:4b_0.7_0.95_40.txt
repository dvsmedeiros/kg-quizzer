Okay, the user wants me to generate 10 question-answer pairs based on the provided list of educational institutions. Let me start by understanding the structure of the data. Each entry has a URL and a type, some with funding type or other attributes. The task is to create questions that ask for the type of these institutions, which are all private schools.

First, I need to make sure each question is unique and refers to a different institution. The user mentioned that the answer should be the type, which is "Private school" in all cases. However, looking at the data, some entries have additional attributes like funding type or other properties, but the main type is "Private school". 

I should avoid repeating the same institution. Let me check the list again to ensure I don't pick the same one multiple times. For example, "St. Andrew's Episcopal School (Maryland)" and "St. John's Preparatory School (Queens)" are different. I need to make sure each question is distinct.

Also, the user specified that the answer should be in the format "Private school" for each. So each answer is the same, but the questions should vary based on different institutions. I'll need to list the names of the schools in the questions, making sure they are correctly referenced from the provided data.

Let me go through the list and pick 10 different ones. I'll start with the first few, then check if there are enough. For example:

1. What is the type of the school "Case Western Reserve University School of Law"? 
2. What is the type of "University School of the Lowcountry"? 
3. What is the type of "St. Paul Academy and Summit School"? 
4. What is the type of "St. Mary's Springs Academy"? 
5. What is the type of "St. John's Preparatory School (Queens)"? 
6. What is the type of "Trinity Christian School (New Jersey)"? 
7. What is the type of "St. Mary's High School (Storm Lake, Iowa)"? 
8. What is the type of "St. Paul High School (Ohio)"? 
9. What is the type of "St. Joseph College–Olongapo"? 
10. What is the type of "University of St. La Salle–Integrated School"?

I need to verify that each of these is indeed in the list and that they are all private schools. Also, ensure that the names are correctly spelled as per the provided data. Once confirmed, these should be the 10 questions with the answer "Private school".
