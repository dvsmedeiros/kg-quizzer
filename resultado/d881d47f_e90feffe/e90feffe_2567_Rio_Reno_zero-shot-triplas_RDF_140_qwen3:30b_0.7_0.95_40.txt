Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs based on the given context and facts about the Rhine River. Let me start by understanding the requirements.

First, the context mentions that the Rhine is 1,233 km long, flows from south to north, and empties into the North Sea via the Rhine-Meuse-Scheldt delta. The facts include various properties like mouth elevation, source, subdivisions, categories, and more.

I should make sure each question is clear and the answer is directly from the provided data. Let me go through the facts step by step.

1. The river's length is stated as 1,233 km. So a question about the length would be straightforward.
2. The source is mentioned as "Tomasee, Surselva, Graubünden, Switzerland." So a question about the source location.
3. The mouth is in the Netherlands, emptying into the North Sea. So questions about where it ends.
4. The subdivisions include countries like Germany, Austria, Belgium, etc. A question about the countries it flows through.
5. The categories list things like "Rivers of Germany," "Border rivers," etc. A question about the categories it's part of.
6. The elevation at the mouth is 0.0 meters. So a question about mouth elevation.
7. The Rhine is classified under various types like "Stream," "Waterway," etc. A question about its classifications.
8. The Rhine is part of the Rhine-Meuse-Scheldt delta. A question about the delta it flows into.
9. The subdivisions have types like "Rhine Basin." A question about the basin it's part of.
10. The Rhine has a Wikipedia template, so a question about the templates used.

I need to ensure each answer is precise and taken directly from the facts. Let me check each fact again to avoid mistakes. For example, the mouth place is Netherlands, and the mouth is North Sea. The source is specific to Tomasee. The classifications include "Stream," "Waterway," etc. The subdivisions include countries and types like "Rhine Basin."

Now, formulating the questions and answers without any markdown, just plain text. Each pair should be on a new line, separated by a semicolon. Let me make sure there are exactly 10 pairs and they are all unique and based on the data provided.
