Okay, I need to generate 10 pairs of questions and answers based on the provided context about the Yuan dynasty. The user has given me a detailed history and some facts, so I should extract relevant information from that.

First, I'll look for key events, rulers, and significant details related to the Yuan dynasty. Then, I'll formulate questions that are clear and directly relate to these points. Each answer must be precise or inferable from the context.

I need to ensure each question is unique and covers different aspects of the dynasty. Also, I should avoid repeating similar questions. Since the user provided several examples, I can follow a similar structure but make sure my new pairs are distinct.

Let me start by identifying important points:
- Founded in 1271
- Ruled until 1368
- Lived Temür Khan as founder
- Later replaced by Ahmad Fanakati
- Key events like the Battle of Xiangyang, Red Turban Rebellion
- Rulers such as Kublai Khan, Mongol conquests, etc.

Now, I'll create questions based on these points:
1. When was the Yuan dynasty founded?
2. Who was the founder of the Yuan dynasty?
3. Who ruled Tibet after the Yuan dynasty?
4. Which empire preceded the Yuan dynasty?
5. What event led to the fall of the Yuan dynasty?
6. Who was the leader of the Mongolian clan Borjigin before Kublai Khan?
7. In which year did Kublai Khan proclaimed the Great Yuan?
8. When did the Yuan dynasty end?
9. Which ruler replaced Ahmad Fanakati in the Yuan dynasty?
10. What significant event occurred after Kublai Khan's reign?

I think these questions cover various aspects and are distinct from each other. Now, I'll match them with their correct answers based on the context provided.
