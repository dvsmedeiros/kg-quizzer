Okay, let's see. The user wants me to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the provided context and facts about the IPCC. The questions need to be varied and cover different aspects of the information given.

First, I need to parse the context and the RDF facts to extract key points. The context mentions the IPCC's creation in 1988 by UNEP and WMO, its purpose to synthesize climate change knowledge, its reports, and the Nobel Peace Prize in 2007. The facts include details like the headquarters in Geneva, the chairperson Hoesung Lee, parent organizations, and notable people associated with the IPCC.

Now, I need to come up with 10 different questions. Let's start with the founding year, the parent organizations, the headquarters, the Nobel Prize, the number of reports, the chairperson, the main purpose, the types of organizations it's part of, the abbreviation, and the fact that it doesn't produce original research. Each of these points is covered in the context or facts, so the answers should be directly extractable.

I need to make sure each question is unique and not repetitive. Also, the answers must be accurate, using the exact information from the provided text. For example, the parent organizations are UNEP and WMO, the headquarters is Geneva, Switzerland, the Nobel Prize was in 2007, and the chairperson is Hoesung Lee.

I should check that all questions are in Portuguese and follow the format strictly. Let me list them out one by one, ensuring they cover different aspects and that the answers are correctly derived from the text.
