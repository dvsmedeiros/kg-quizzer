Okay, I need to generate 10 pairs of questions and answers based on the provided context and facts about the Scottish Parliament. Let me start by understanding the key points from the context and facts given.

First, the Scottish Parliament is a unicameral legislative body in Scotland, located in Holyrood, Edinburgh. It has 129 members (MSPs) elected every four years using a mixed-member proportional representation system. The last election was on May 5, 2016. The first session was in May 1999. The current president is mentioned but not named. The Parliament is part of the UK, and the Scottish Government is responsible for it. The Parliament has various committees and commissions, such as Transport in the UK, Local Government in Scotland, Health and Sport, etc. The leaders include the First Minister, Presiding Officer, and other ministers. The Parliament has a specific image and building, and it's part of the UK's legislative framework.

Now, looking at the facts provided, there are a lot of specific details about constituencies, parties, committees, and other roles. I need to create questions that are varied and cover different aspects. Let me list possible topics:

1. Number of members
2. Location
3. Type of legislature
4. Election date
5. Committees
6. Leaders (First Minister, Presiding Officer)
7. Relationship with the UK Parliament
8. Historical context (first session, last election)
9. Political parties and their seats
10. Specific committees or commissions

I should ensure that each question is unique and based on the given facts. Let me check the facts again to confirm the details.

For example, the number of members is 129. The location is Edinburgh, Scotland. The type is unicameral. The last election was May 5, 2016. The first session was May 12, 1999. The Presiding Officer is a leader. The Parliament is part of the UK, and the Scottish Government is responsible. There are committees like Transport, Health, etc. The First Minister is a member. The image is mentioned, and the building is Scottish Parliament Building.

Also, the facts mention specific parties and their seats, like the Scottish National Party (SNP) has 2 seats, the Socialist Party has 1, etc. There are also specific constituencies that have "Scottish Parliament" as their name. The Parliament has a website template and other wiki templates.

I need to make sure that each question is directly answerable from the given facts. For example, "How many members does the Scottish Parliament have?" answer is 129. "Where is the Scottish Parliament located?" answer is Edinburgh, Scotland. "What is the type of the Scottish Parliament?" answer is unicameral. "When was the first session of the Scottish Parliament held?" answer is May 12, 1999. "What is the role of the First Minister of Scotland?" answer is that they respond to the Scottish Parliament. "What is the name of the building where the Scottish Parliament meets?" answer is Scottish Parliament Building. "What is the name of the image representing the Scottish Parliament?" answer is Scottish Parliament Debating Chamber 2.jpg. "What is the last election date of the Scottish Parliament?" answer is May 5, 2016. "What is the name of the committee related to health and sport?" answer is Health and Sport. "Which political party has 2 seats in the Scottish Parliament?" answer is the Scottish National Party (SNP).

I need to ensure that the questions and answers are accurate based on the provided facts and not adding any external knowledge. Let me verify each point again to make sure they are covered in the facts.

Yes, the facts mention all these details. Now, I can structure the 10 questions accordingly, making sure each is unique and covers different aspects. Avoid repeating the same topic. For example, one question about the number of members, another about the location, another about the type of legislature, another about the first session, another about the last election, another about the Presiding Officer, another about the Scottish Government's role, another about a specific committee, another about a political party's seats, and another about the building's name.

I need to make sure the answers are correctly derived from the facts. Let me check each answer again:

- Number of members: 129 (fact says "129 members")
- Location: Edinburgh, Scotland (fact says "located in Holyrood, Edinburgh")
- Type: unicameral (fact says "unicameral legislative body")
- First session: May 12, 1999 (fact says "first session was in May 1999")
- Last election: May 5, 2016 (fact says "last election was on May 5, 2016")
- Role of First Minister: respond to the Scottish Parliament (fact says "First Minister of Scotland... responds to the Scottish Parliament")
- Building: Scottish Parliament Building (fact says "local of meeting is Scottish Parliament Building")
- Image name: Scottish Parliament Debating Chamber 2.jpg (fact says "image representativa Scottish Parliament Debating Chamber 2.jpg")
- Committee: Health and Sport (fact says "comissões Health and Sport")
- Political party with 2 seats: SNP (fact says "Scottish National Party... título do assento 2")

Yes, all these are covered. Now, I can format the questions and answers accordingly, ensuring they are in the correct format and match the examples given.
