Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs about Warsaw based on the provided data. Let me start by reviewing the information given. 

First, the user provided a list of triples related to Warsaw. The main subject here is Warsaw, and there are various properties and relations. For example, Warsaw is the capital of Poland, has a motto, is located on the Vistula River, has a population, etc. Also, there are some specific data points like the highest temperature recorded in June, the motto, and some historical events like the Warsaw Uprising.

Looking at the examples given, the questions are typically straightforward, asking for specific facts like the river Warsaw is on, the distance to the Baltic Sea, population, etc. The answers are concise and based on the data provided.

Now, I need to create 10 new pairs. Let me check the data again to find other relevant points. The triples mention things like the motto "Semper invicta," the highest temperature in June (36.2°C), the number of precipitation days (162.9), the location on the Vistula River, and the classification as the 32nd most habitable city in 2012. Also, there's information about the number of people in the largest metropolitan area (2.666 million), and the economic characteristics like variety of industries.

I should make sure each question is unique and covers different aspects. Let me list possible questions:

1. What is the motto of Warsaw? (Answer: Semper invicta)
2. What is the highest temperature recorded in Warsaw in June? (36.2°C)
3. How many days of precipitation does Warsaw have annually? (162.9 days)
4. On which river is Warsaw located? (Vistula)
5. What is the population of Warsaw's largest metropolitan area? (2.666 million)
6. Which organization classified Warsaw as the 32nd most habitable city in 2012? (The answer is not directly given, but the example mentions "Quem classificou..." which translates to "Who classified..." so maybe the answer is the same as the example, but I need to check the data. The example answer for the 32nd city was "Frontex," but that's for a different question. Wait, in the examples, the answer to "Quem classificou Varsóvia como a 32ª cidade mais habitável do mundo?" is missing, but in the data, the user might have intended it to be the same as the example's previous question. However, the data provided doesn't mention who did the classification, only that it was in 2012. Hmm, maybe I can't use that unless the data has that info. Let me check again. The data doesn't mention who did the classification, only the year. So perhaps that question isn't answerable from the given data. I'll skip that and find other points.)

Other possible questions:

7. What is the significance of the motto "Semper invicta" for Warsaw?
8. What are the main economic characteristics of Warsaw? (variety of industries)
9. Which bridge is mentioned in the data as having a locale in Warsaw? (Łazienkowski Bridge)
10. What is the name of the city's official website mentioned in the data? (The URL given is for Warsaw Guide, but the actual official website might be different. However, the data provides a URL for the website, which is archived. The answer would be the URL provided.)

Wait, the data has a URL: ns1:url <https://web.archive.org/web/20120405081905/http:/www.warsawguide.com/> ; So the answer could be that the official website is archived at that URL. But maybe it's better to use the motto, the river, the population, etc. Let me make sure each question is answerable from the given data.

Also, the user included examples where some answers are missing, but in the generated pairs, I need to ensure that the answers are present in the data. So I'll avoid questions that require external knowledge.

Another point is the number of people in the largest metropolitan area: 2.666 million. That's a good question.

So compiling the list:

1. What is the motto of Warsaw? -> Semper invicta
2. On which river is Warsaw located? -> Vistula
3. What is the highest temperature recorded in Warsaw in June? -> 36.2°C
4. How many days of precipitation does Warsaw experience annually? -> 162.9 days
5. What is the population of Warsaw's largest metropolitan area? -> 2.666 million
6. What is the economic characteristic of Warsaw? -> a variety of industries
7. What is the significance of the Łazienkowski Bridge in Warsaw? -> It is mentioned with a locale in Warsaw, but the exact significance isn't clear from the data. Maybe not the best question.
8. What is the URL of Warsaw's official website as mentioned in the data? -> The archived URL provided (https://web.archive.org/web/20120405081905/http:/www.warsawguide.com/)
9. Which city is the capital of Poland? -> Warsaw
10. What is the classification of Warsaw in terms of habitability as of 2012? -> 32nd most habitable city

Wait, the data does mention that Warsaw was classified as the 32nd most habitable city in 2012. The example includes a question about that, but the answer is missing. However, in the data, the year is given as 2012, but the organization that did the classification isn't specified. So the answer would be "32nd most habitable city in 2012" even without the organization. That's acceptable.

So, compiling the 10 pairs now.
