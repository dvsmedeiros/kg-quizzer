Okay, the user wants me to generate 10 objective questions and answers based on the provided context about the 1973 oil crisis. Let me start by understanding the context. The user mentioned "Crise_petrolífera_de_1973," which is the 1973 oil crisis. I need to make sure the questions are relevant to that topic.

First, I should recall the key points of the 1973 oil crisis. The main events were the OPEC oil embargo, the Yom Kippur War, the impact on global oil prices, and the resulting economic effects. The crisis was triggered by the Arab oil embargo in October 1973, which led to a significant increase in oil prices. Countries like the US and Europe were heavily affected, leading to economic recessions and energy shortages.

Now, I need to create 10 different questions that cover various aspects of this crisis. Let me brainstorm possible questions:

1. What event triggered the 1973 oil crisis?
2. Which countries were involved in the Yom Kippur War?
3. What was the main consequence of the oil embargo?
4. What was the price of oil in 1974 compared to the 1970s?
5. Which countries were most affected by the crisis?
6. What was the primary cause of the oil embargo?
7. What was the impact on the US economy?
8. What was the role of OPEC in the crisis?
9. Which event led to the oil embargo?
10. What was the result of the oil price increase?

I need to ensure each question is unique and covers different aspects. Let me check if these are all based on the provided context. The user might have a specific set of facts they want included, but since the context is not provided here, I'll assume standard facts about the 1973 oil crisis.

Wait, the user specified that the answers must be explicitly or inferably from the content. Since the context is the 1973 oil crisis, I need to make sure each answer is accurate based on that. Also, the questions should be in Portuguese. Let me translate the questions and answers into Portuguese, making sure they are correctly formulated.

I should avoid repeating similar questions. For example, the first question is about the trigger event, and the ninth question is about the event that led to the embargo. I need to ensure they are distinct. Also, check that each answer is correct and directly related to the context. For instance, the Yom Kippur War was the event that led to the embargo, so that's correct.

Another thing: the oil price in 1974 was double the 1970s price, but I need to confirm that. The 1973 crisis led to prices doubling, so that's accurate. The US and Europe were the most affected, so that's correct.

I also need to make sure the answers are in Portuguese. Let me check each answer for correct terminology. For example, "embargo" is the correct term for the oil cutoff. OPEC's role is to coordinate production, so that's accurate.

Now, compiling all the questions and answers in the CSV format as specified. Each pair is separated by a semicolon, and the entire thing is in Portuguese. I need to ensure there are exactly 10 pairs without any extra content. Let me count to make sure there are 10. Also, check for any possible repetition or inaccuracies.

Once that's done, present the CSV as the final answer without any additional text. That should meet the user's requirements.
