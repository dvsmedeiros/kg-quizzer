Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs in Portuguese based on the given context and facts about the IPCC. Let me start by understanding the context and the facts provided.

First, the context explains that the IPCC is a scientific-political organization under the UN, created in 1988, and its main role is to summarize climate change knowledge. It doesn't do original research but synthesizes existing work. It has produced several reports, and it's known for the Nobel Peace Prize in 2007. The facts include various details like its headquarters in Geneva, leaders like Hoesung Lee, types of organizations it's part of, and some people associated with it.

Now, I need to create 10 varied questions. Each should be unique and cover different aspects. Let me brainstorm possible questions:

1. What is the main objective of the IPCC? (From the context)
2. When was the IPCC established? (Context mentions 1988)
3. What is the main function of the IPCC? (Context says it doesn't do original research but synthesizes)
4. Who is the current leader? (Facts mention Hoesung Lee)
5. Where is the headquarters? (Facts say Geneva, Switzerland)
6. What is the acronym for the IPCC in English? (Context says IPCC)
7. What prize did the IPCC receive in 2007? (Context mentions Nobel Peace Prize)
8. How many major reports has the IPCC published? (Context says five, with the last in 2014)
9. What is the role of the IPCC in climate policy? (Context says it's the main basis for policies)
10. Which organizations is the IPCC part of? (Facts mention World Meteorological Organization and UNEP)

Wait, need to check if these are all covered in the context and facts. The facts also mention some people like Filippo Giorgi, but maybe that's too specific. Also, need to ensure that each answer is directly from the context or facts. Let me verify each:

1. Objective: Yes, the context says it synthesizes knowledge on climate change.
2. Established in 1988: Correct.
3. Main function: Synthesizing existing research, not original.
4. Hoesung Lee as leader: Yes, in facts.
5. Geneva: Yes.
6. IPCC as acronym: Yes.
7. Nobel Peace Prize 2007: Correct.
8. Five reports since 1990: The context says five and last in 2014.
9. Basis for climate policies: Yes.
10. Part of WMO and UNEP: Facts mention both.

I need to make sure the questions are in Portuguese and the answers are accurate. Also, avoid repetition. Let me structure them as CSV pairs.
