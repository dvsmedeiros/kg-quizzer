Okay, I need to create exactly 10 pairs of questions and answers based on the context provided. Let me start by understanding what's given.

The context is about the 1973 oil crisis in the United States. It mentions how the US produced a lot of oil, which caused prices to go up and lead to various economic challenges. The main events are the beginning of the crisis, the second crisis in 1979, and the first choke of 1973. There's also mention of the Organization of the Arab Republics (OAR) exporting their oil.

I should focus on different aspects of this crisis to make each question unique but related. Let me think about possible areas: causes, impacts, responses, economic policies, etc.

First question could be about when the crisis started. Then, what was the first choke? I can also ask why the US produced so much oil and how it affected prices.

Another angle is the economic impact on different groups, like the OAR members separating from the US during the crisis. That's a good question.

I need to ensure each response is clear and correct based on the context provided. Also, each pair should have only one question and answer without any extra information or comments.
