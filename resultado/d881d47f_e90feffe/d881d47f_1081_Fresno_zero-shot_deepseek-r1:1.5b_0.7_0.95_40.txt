Alright, let me try to figure out how to approach this task. So the user wants a generator of objective questions based on given contexts and facts. They provided a specific context which is "Fresno," but I'm not sure that's relevant here because there's no information about a town named Fresno in the provided content. Maybe it was just a placeholder.

First, I need to understand the guidelines thoroughly. The user wants exactly 10 pairs formatted as CSV with each pair having a question and a correct answer separated by a semicolon. The questions should be relevant to the context given, which is missing here. Each question must relate clearly to the provided content, but since there's no content, I'm guessing the user might have intended for a more general context or perhaps Fresno is just an example they meant to include.

Looking at the instructions, it says that each question should have a unique correct answer, which could be explained explicitly or inferred from the context. Since the context here doesn't provide any data, I can only rely on my own knowledge and assumptions about what's relevant when generating questions. Maybe Fresno is part of an area known for certain activities, like being a tourist destination or a city in a region with specific characteristics.

I need to create 10 different types of questions that cover various aspects of the context. Even without the specific context, I can think of general questions related to the location. For example:

1. Where is Fresno located?
2. Is Fresno known for being a tourist destination?
3. What activities are common in Fresno?

But since the user wants both question and answer pairs, I should make sure each question has a single correct answer. Maybe include some factual information or specific features of the area.

However, without any data from the context, it's challenging to generate accurate and relevant questions. Perhaps the user intended for a different context that includes Fresno, but since it's not provided, I'll have to work with what's given. Alternatively, maybe they meant to include more details about Fresno in their request, which aren't visible here.

In conclusion, despite the missing context, I can generate questions based on general knowledge and assumptions. Each question should relate clearly to the hypothetical Fresno area, covering different aspects such as geography, culture, events, etc., ensuring each has a unique correct answer that can be inferred or explained.
