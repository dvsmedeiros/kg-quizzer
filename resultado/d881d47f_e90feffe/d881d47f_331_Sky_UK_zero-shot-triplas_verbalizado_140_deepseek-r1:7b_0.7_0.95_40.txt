Okay, I need to generate 10 pairs of questions and answers based on the provided context about British Satellite Broadcasting (BSB). The user has given me specific instructions, so let me go through them carefully.

First, I should read through the context thoroughly to understand what information is available. BSB was a British satellite broadcasting company that existed from 1986 until its merger with Sky UK in 1990. They provided direct TV services and were involved in various mergers and acquisitions during their time.

The user wants me to create 10 question-answer pairs, each based on the context. Each pair should have a question followed by the correct answer, all in Portuguese (as per the instructions). Additionally, I need to format them as CSV with the separator being a semicolon.

I also need to make sure that each question is unique and directly related to the content provided. No repeating questions or similar ones. The answers must be accurate based on the context given.

Let me start brainstorming possible questions:

1. When was British Satellite Broadcasting founded?  
   Answer: 1986  
   (This comes from the context, mentioning "fundo no ano de 1986")

2. What year did BSB merge with Sky UK?  
   Answer: 1990  
   (Context says they merged in March 1990 to form BSkyB)

3. How many companies were involved in the merger of BSB and Sky TV PLC?  
   Answer: 2

4. What was the main purpose of British Satellite Broadcasting?  
   Answer: Provide direct-to-consumer satellite TV services

5. Which channel owned by BSB is mentioned in the context?  
   Answer: The Power Station  
   (Context mentions "The Power Station (TV channel) tem como(propriedade da empresa British Satellite Broadcasting)"

6. What was a result of BSB's merger with Sky TV PLC?  
   Answer: Formed BSkyB  
   (Directly stated)

7. When did BSB stop transmitting in the UK?

   (Context says "Hardware (film) foi produzido no est√∫dio British Satellite Broadcasting")

9. Which organization type did BSB change into during the merger?

10. What is a specific event associated with BSB related to their history?  
    Answer: Merged with Sky Television PLC to form BSkyB

I think these cover different aspects of the context, each question leads to one correct answer without ambiguity.

Now, I'll format them into a CSV as specified.
