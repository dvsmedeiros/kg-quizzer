Okay, I need to generate 10 pairs of questions and answers in Portuguese based on the provided context and facts. Let me start by understanding the context and facts given.

The context explains that political Islam is a political-religious ideology. Its supporters, called "al-Islamiyyun," aim to implement their interpretation of Islam in the state or society. They emphasize implementing Sharia, pan-Islamic unity, creating Islamic states, and rejecting non-Muslim influences, especially Western ones. The facts list various groups and individuals associated with Islamism, along with some categories and images.

Now, the task is to create 10 unique, varied questions and their correct answers. Each question must be directly related to the content provided. I need to ensure that the answers are either explicit or inferable from the context and facts.

First, I'll go through the context to extract key points. The main aspects are: definition of political Islam, its goals (Sharia, pan-Islamic unity, Islamic states), rejection of non-Muslim influences, and the groups/individuals associated with it.

Looking at the facts, there are many groups with "possui ideologia Islamism" (has the ideology of Islamism). Also, there are mentions of images, models, and types like "Cognition100023271" and "YagoPermanentlyLocatedEntity." But since the user wants answers based on the context and facts, I should focus on the context's explanation rather than the specific group names unless they are mentioned in the context.

Wait, the context doesn't mention specific groups. It just says that many are affiliated with Islamic institutions or social movements. The facts list a lot of groups, but the context doesn't name them. So, the answers should be based on the context, not the specific group names. For example, the context mentions "rejeição de influências não-muçulmanas - particularmente ocidentais" (rejection of non-Muslim influences, particularly Western ones). So a question could be about what Islamism rejects.

Another point is the implementation of Sharia. So a question could ask about the main goal of political Islam. Also, the context mentions "unidade política pan-islâmica" (pan-Islamic political unity), so a question could be about that.

I need to avoid repeating similar questions. Let me brainstorm possible questions:

1. What is the main goal of political Islam? (Answer: Implementing Sharia, pan-Islamic unity, creating Islamic states, rejecting non-Muslim influences.)
2. What does political Islam emphasize? (Answer: Implementation of Sharia, pan-Islamic unity, Islamic states, rejection of non-Muslim influences.)
3. Which influences does political Islam reject? (Answer: Non-Muslim, particularly Western ones.)
4. What is the term for supporters of political Islam? (Answer: "al-Islamiyyun")
5. What is the focus of political Islam in society? (Answer: Implementing their interpretation of Islam in the state or society.)
6. What is the term for Islamic social movements? (Answer: "al-harakat al-Islamiyyah")
7. What is the main objective of political Islam regarding governance? (Answer: Creating Islamic states.)
8. What is the role of Islamic institutions in political Islam? (Answer: They are often affiliated with Islamic institutions or social movements.)
9. What is the main characteristic of political Islam's ideology? (Answer: Combining political and religious aspects to implement Islam in society/state.)
10. What is the primary focus of political Islam in terms of unity? (Answer: Pan-Islamic political unity.)

Wait, the context says "unidade política pan-islâmica" (pan-Islamic political unity), so that's a key point. Also, the term "al-Islamiyyun" and "al-harakat al-Islamiyyah" are mentioned.

I need to make sure each question is unique and covers different aspects. Let me check the facts again to see if there are any other elements. The facts mention images, models, and types, but the context doesn't refer to those. So I should stick to the context's content.

Let me structure the questions and answers accordingly, ensuring they are in Portuguese and follow the CSV format.
