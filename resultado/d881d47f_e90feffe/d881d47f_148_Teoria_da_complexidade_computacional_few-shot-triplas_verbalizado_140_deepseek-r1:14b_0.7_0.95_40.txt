Okay, so I need to create a CSV with exactly 10 pairs of questions and answers based on the provided context and facts about computational complexity theory. Let me go through the process step by step.

First, I'll review the context given. It says that computational complexity theory focuses on classifying computational problems based on their resource usage and explores relationships between these classifications. It's part of theoretical computer science and mathematics.

Looking at the facts, there are several key points:

1. Nikolai Sergeevich Bakhvalov is known for computational complexity theory.
2. The theory has a hypernym branch.
3. It's categorized under various types like PsychologicalFeature, Structure, Act, Thing, etc.
4. There are many notable figures in the field such as Jelani Nelson, Ryan Williams, Vijay Vazirani, and others.
5. It uses specific Wikipedia page templates like Template:Computer science, Template:Quote, etc.
6. It has images associated with it, like "Complexity subsets pspace.svg."
7. There are categories and topics related to computational fields of study.

Now, I need to generate varied questions that cover different aspects without repeating similar ones. Each question should have a single correct answer based on the facts provided.

Let me think about possible angles:

- What is the main focus of computational complexity theory? (Classification)
- Who are some key figures in this field?
- Which Wikipedia templates does it use?
- What types or categories is it associated with?
- What images represent it?

I need to make sure each question is unique and covers different aspects. Let me try to list out the questions:

1. What is the main focus of computational complexity theory? (Classification)
2. Who contributed significantly to computational complexity theory? (Nikolai Sergeevich Bakhvalov)
3. Under which category is computational complexity theory classified in Wikipedia? (Computer science)
4. Which notable figure works in this field? (Christos Papadimitriou)
5. What type of classification does it involve? (Complexity classes)
6. What kind of structure is it associated with? (Thing)
7. Which area does it relate to? (Mathematical structures)
8. How does it help in practice? (Understanding resource requirements)
9. What model is used for computation? (Turing machine)
10. Which key researcher contributed? (Vijay Vazirani)

I think these cover different aspects: focus, contributors, categories, notable figures, classifications, types, areas, practical applications, computational models, and specific researchers.

Now, I'll frame each as a question and pair it with the correct answer from the facts. Each line should be in CSV format with semicolon separators.
