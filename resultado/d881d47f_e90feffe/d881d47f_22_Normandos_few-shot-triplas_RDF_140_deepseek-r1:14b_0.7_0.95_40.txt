Alright, so I need to generate 10 true/false questions based on the provided context about Normans. Let me start by reading through the context and facts carefully.

The context mentions that Normans were a Germanic people established in northern France, with their aristocracy descending from Viking expeditions. They are also referred to as Northmen or Norsemen. Their history includes significant political, military, and cultural roles across parts of medieval Europe and the Middle East. Notable events include the colonization of Normandy, the Norman Conquest of England, establishment in Sicily and southern Italy, and participation in the Crusades.

Looking at the facts section, there are many RDF triples indicating various aspects of Normans: their battles, architecture (like castles), family names associated with them, places they occupied, etc. These can be used to create questions about specific events, structures, or people related to Normans.

I need to ensure each question is unique and covers different aspects without repeating similar ones. Let's brainstorm possible topics:

1. Battles: They were involved in several battles across Europe.
2. Architecture: They built castles with motte-and-bailey structures.
3. Language: They spoke Old Norman, which was related to French.
4. Religion: They transitioned from Norse paganism to Christianity.
5. Notable people: Leaders like William the Conqueror or Richard of Salerno.

Now, I'll structure each question and its answer:

1. **Battles**: The Normans fought in the Battle of Hastings. (Answer: Yes)
2. **Architecture**: They built motte-and-bailey castles. (Yes)
3. **Language**: Did they speak Old Norman? (Yes)
4. **Religion**: Were they Christian by 1000 AD? (Yes, as per context)
5. **Notable People**: William the Conqueror led the invasion of England. (Yes)
6. **Colonization**: They colonized Normandy. (Yes)
7. **Influence in Italy**: Settled in Sicily and southern Italy. (Yes)
8. **Participation in Crusades**: Yes.
9. **Cultural Impact**: Influenced medieval European culture. (Yes)
10. **Origin**: Descended from Vikings. (Yes)

Wait, these are all yes/no questions, which might be too repetitive. Maybe I should vary the format by asking specific details or comparing with other groups.

Alternatively, perhaps some can be phrased as true/false but include specific elements. For example:

1. The Normans were Germanic people from northern France.
2. They established a duchy in Normandy.
3. Viking expeditions contributed to their aristocracy.
4. Northmen refers exclusively to Normans.
5. Their architecture included motte-and-bailey castles.
6. They spoke Old Norman, which is a Romance language.
7. Norse paganism was their main religion before conversion.
8. William the Conqueror was a Norman leader in England.
9. The Siege of Mahdia involved Normans.
10. Their influence included establishing states in Sicily.

But I need to ensure each question is clear and directly tied to the facts provided.

Wait, perhaps some points are better suited as true/false rather than direct statements. Let me make sure they're accurate based on the context:

- The Normans were Germanic: Yes.
- Established a duchy in Normandy: Yes.
- Aristocracy from Viking expeditions: Yes.
- Northmen refers exclusively to Normans? No, it's a broader term for Scandinavians. Wait, but the context says "Northmen" is used as a synonym for Normans. Hmm.

Wait, the context says that Normans are often called Northmen or Norsemen, which means "Men of the North." So perhaps they're synonymous with Normans in this context.

I need to be cautious not to assume beyond what's provided. The facts mention specific battles, places, and people associated with Normans. So perhaps better to focus on those specifics.

Another approach is to use the RDF triples as data points. For example:

- They fought in the Battle of Cerami.
- Occupied Callan Motte.
- Richard of Salerno was a Norman.
- Their language included Old Norman, Latin, and Old Norse.

Using these, I can create questions like:

1. Did Normans fight in the Battle of Cerami? Yes.
2. Were they occupants of Callan Motte? Yes.
3. Was Richard of Salerno a Norman? Yes.
4. Did Normans speak Old Norman? Yes.
5. They spoke Latin as well: Yes.
6. Did they practice Norse paganism? Context says they transitioned to Christianity, so initially yes, but by the time period covered, perhaps not.

Wait, the context mentions that Normans were originally pagans but converted. So a question could be about their religion before conversion.

Alternatively, perhaps focusing on specific facts:

1. **Battle**: The Battle of Hastings involved Normans.
2. **Architecture**: Motte-and-bailey castles are associated with them.
3. **Language**: They spoke Old Norman.
4. **Religion**: Transitioned from paganism to Christianity.
5. **Notable Person**: William the Conqueror was a Norman leader.
6. **Colonization**: Settled in Normandy.
7. **Influence**: Participated in the Crusades.
8. **Origin**: Descended from Vikings.
9. **Family Names**: Some family names have Norman origins.
10. **Military Tactics**: Used specific military strategies.

But I need to frame these as true/false questions based on the facts provided.

I think it's better to structure each question to test specific knowledge points, ensuring they're accurate and vary in content to cover different aspects of Normans.
