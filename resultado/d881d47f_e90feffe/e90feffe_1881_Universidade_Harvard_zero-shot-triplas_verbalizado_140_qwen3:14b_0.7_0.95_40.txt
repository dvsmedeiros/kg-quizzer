Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the provided context and facts. First, I need to make sure I understand the context thoroughly. The main information is about Harvard University, its history, structure, notable alumni, and some other details.

Looking at the facts, there are a lot of names associated with Harvard through various roles like alumni, educators, employees, etc. The challenge is to create diverse questions that cover different aspects of the university without repeating similar questions.

Starting with the context: Harvard's founding, location, Ivy League membership, its transformation into a research university, the merger with Radcliffe, the current structure with 11 academic units, the main campus location, the Nobel laureates, presidents, and the budget. These are all key points that can form questions.

Now, the facts list many individuals linked to Harvard. Each of these can be used to create questions about who is associated with Harvard in different capacities. For example, asking about the alma mater of a specific person, their role, or where they work.

I need to ensure that each question is unique and covers different aspects. For instance, one question could be about the founding year, another about the number of Nobel laureates, and others about specific people's affiliations.

Also, I need to check that the answers are directly from the context or the facts. For example, the answer to "Em que ano foi fundada a Universidade de Harvard?" is 1636, which is in the context. Similarly, the answer to "Quem foi a primeira reitora mulher da Universidade de Harvard?" is Drew Gilpin Faust, as mentioned in the context.

For the facts, each person's association with Harvard is listed. So, questions like "Qual é a alma mater de David Edwards (engineer)?" would have the answer "Harvard University".

I should also avoid repetition. For example, not asking multiple questions about the same person or the same fact. Since there are over 100 names listed, I can pick a variety of them.

Another point is to ensure that the questions are in Portuguese, as specified, and the answers are correctly formatted with semicolons. Also, making sure that the CSV has exactly 10 rows without any additional text.

Let me list out possible questions:

1. Quando a Universidade de Harvard foi fundada?
2. Quem foi a primeira reitora mulher da Universidade de Harvard?
3. Em qual cidade está localizado o campus principal da Universidade de Harvard?
4. Quantos prêmios Nobel estão associados à Universidade de Harvard?
5. Qual é a alma mater de Jyotiraditya Scindia?
6. Quem é o reitor da Universidade de Harvard em 2007?
7. Qual é a alma mater de Bobby Scott?
8. Qual é a alma mater de Clara Chou?
9. Qual é a alma mater de Robert P. George?
10. Qual é a alma mater de Stephen A. Fulling?

Wait, but some of these might be overlapping. Let me check the context again for the numbers. The context says "cerca de 150 ganhadores do Prêmios Nobel" so the answer to question 4 would be "cerca de 150".

For the alma mater questions, the facts list many names. For example, Jyotiraditya Scindia's alma mater is Harvard. Similarly, Bobby Scott was educated there. Clara Chou's alma mater is Harvard. Robert P. George was educated there. Stephen A. Fulling's alma mater is Harvard.

I need to ensure that each answer is correctly taken from the facts. Also, the question about the first female president is Drew Gilpin Faust, as per the context.

Another question could be about the number of academic units, which is 11. Or the location of the main campus in Cambridge.

I think that's a good start. Now, compiling these into the CSV format with semicolons, ensuring 10 unique questions.
