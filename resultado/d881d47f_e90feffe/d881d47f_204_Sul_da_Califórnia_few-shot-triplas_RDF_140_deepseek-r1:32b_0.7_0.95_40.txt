Okay, so I'm trying to answer these questions about Southern California based on the data provided. Let me go through each question one by one and see what information I can extract from the given text.

1. **How is Southern California commonly abbreviated?**
   - Looking at the examples, it's "SoCal". That seems straightforward.

2. **Despite being traditionally described as having eight counties, how many counties does the region actually have?**
   - The example says "to condados", which I think might be a typo and should be "10 counties". But in the data provided, under the subdivision section, it lists several counties: Kern, San Diego, San Luis Obispo, Riverside, San Bernardino, Ventura. That's six counties listed, but maybe there are more? Or perhaps the example is incorrect.

3. **What is Southern California's major significance regarding California and the United States?**
   - The example mentions it's an economic center. So that should be the answer.

4. **Which ties best describe the basis of the "eight counties"?**
   - The example says demographic and economic ties. That seems to fit.

5. **What are the reasons for adding two more counties based on?**
   - The example mentions historical political divisions. That's a good point.

6. **What is the name of the region that isn't defined by the eight or ten county definitions?**
   - The example says "região do sul da Califórnia". So in English, it would be the Southern California region.

7. **How many regions are there in the United States?**
   - The example mentions 11. I'm not sure if that's accurate, but based on the instruction, I'll go with 11.

8. **What is the name of the state into which this region expands to the east?**
   - The example says Nevada. That makes sense as Southern California borders Nevada.

9. **On which border does the region extend?**
   - The example mentions the Mexican border, so that's the southern border.

10. **What is the name of the area beyond that border where the region extends?**
    - The example says Tijuana, which is a city in Mexico just south of San Diego.

Wait, looking back at the subdivision section, Southern California includes Kern, San Diego, San Luis Obispo, Riverside, San Bernardino, and Ventura counties. That's six counties, but the examples mention eight or ten. Maybe I need to check if there are more counties listed elsewhere in the data. Let me look again.

In the detailed information, under ns1:subdivision, it lists Kern, San Diego, San Luis Obispo, Riverside, San Bernardino, and Ventura. That's six. But maybe other parts of the data mention additional counties? I don't see any more listed, so perhaps the examples are incorrect or based on a different source.

But since the instruction is to follow the given data, I should stick with what's provided. So for question 2, it might actually be six counties instead of eight or ten. However, the example says "to condados", which seems like a typo for "10". Maybe in the original Portuguese, "to" was intended as "dez" (ten). So I'll proceed with that.

Also, for question 6, since the data mentions it's called Southern California without relying on county definitions, that fits.

I think I've covered all questions based on the provided data and examples. Now, I'll format the answers accordingly.
