Alright, I need to help this user by generating a quiz based on the provided context and facts about the Normans. Let me start by understanding what exactly they're asking for. 

The user wants 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format, each with a Portuguese question and answer separated by a semicolon. The questions must cover different aspects of the given content without repeating similar ones. They also specified not to add any extra comments or explanations—just the CSV data.

Looking at the context and facts provided, I'll note key points like the origin of Normans, their religion, languages they spoke, related ethnic groups, historical events, architecture styles, and notable individuals. Each of these areas can form a basis for a question.

I should ensure that each question has only one correct answer and that it's clear from the content. For example, a question about the origin could have "Germânicos" as the answer. Another could ask about their religion, which is Norse paganism. I'll also make sure to vary the types of questions—some might be about languages, others about architecture styles or historical battles.

I need to avoid any markdown formatting and keep the thinking process in English, but the final output should strictly follow the CSV format with Portuguese content. It's important to double-check each answer against the provided facts to ensure accuracy.

Finally, I'll structure the 10 questions, making sure they're distinct and cover a broad range of topics related to Normans without overlapping too much. Once satisfied, I'll present them in the required CSV format as per the user's instructions.
