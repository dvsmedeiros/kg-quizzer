Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the provided context and facts. Let me start by understanding the context and the facts given.

The main topic is civil disobedience, which is a form of peaceful protest against unjust laws or oppressive governments. It was first formulated by Henry David Thoreau and later applied by figures like Gandhi, MLK, and others. The facts list various instances where civil disobedience was used, such as in the Indian independence movement, the US civil rights movement, protests in Montenegro, the End SARS movement, etc. There are also mentions of specific events, people, and organizations associated with civil disobedience.

Now, I need to create questions that are varied and cover different aspects. The questions should be related to the context and facts provided. Each question must have a unique and correct answer derived from the content.

Let me brainstorm possible questions. The first thing that comes to mind is the definition of civil disobedience. Then, historical figures like Thoreau and Gandhi. Then, examples of movements or events that used civil disobedience. Also, the purpose or reasons behind it. Maybe some specific events like the 2021 End SARS protests. Also, the use of civil disobedience in different countries or contexts, like in Montenegro or the US.

I need to make sure not to repeat similar questions. Let me check the example given to see the structure. The examples include questions about the term, historical events, people involved, and the purpose.

So, possible questions could be:

1. What is the term for peaceful protest against unjust laws?
2. Who is considered the founder of civil disobedience?
3. Which movement used civil disobedience in India?
4. What is an example of a modern civil disobedience movement?
5. What is the purpose of civil disobedience?
6. Which historical event is associated with civil disobedience in the US?
7. Which country's protests in 2021 involved civil disobedience?
8. What is the main idea behind civil disobedience?
9. Who is known for using civil disobedience in the US?
10. What is an example of a protest that used civil disobedience in the 2010s?

Now, I need to check if these questions are based on the facts provided. For example, the End SARS protests in 2021 are mentioned, the 2021 Montenegrin protests, the 2019 Montenegrin anti-corruption protests, the 2020 LGBT protests in Poland, and others. Also, the examples given in the context include Gandhi, MLK, and the US civil rights movement.

I need to ensure that the answers are correct and directly from the context. Let me verify each answer against the facts.

1. The term is civil disobedience. Correct.
2. Henry David Thoreau. Correct.
3. Indian independence movement. Correct, as per the context.
4. End SARS protests in 2021. Correct, as per the facts.
5. Purpose is to oppose unjust laws. Correct.
6. US civil rights movement. Correct.
7. 2021 Montenegrin protests. Correct.
8. The main idea is to oppose unjust laws. Correct.
9. Martin Luther King. Correct.
10. 2020 LGBT protests in Poland. Correct, as per the facts.

I think these questions cover different aspects: definition, founder, historical movement, modern example, purpose, US example, specific country's protest, main idea, person associated with US, and another modern example.

Now, I need to format them into CSV pairs, making sure each line is in the correct format with a semicolon separator. Let me check the example again to ensure the format is correct.

Yes, the example shows each line as "pergunta;resposta" with each question and answer separated by a semicolon. The CSV should have 10 lines, each with one question and one answer.

I need to make sure that the answers are correct and not just general knowledge. For example, the answer for the 2021 End SARS protests is correct as per the facts. The answer for the 2020 LGBT protests in Poland is also correct.

I think that's all. Let me compile them into the CSV format.
