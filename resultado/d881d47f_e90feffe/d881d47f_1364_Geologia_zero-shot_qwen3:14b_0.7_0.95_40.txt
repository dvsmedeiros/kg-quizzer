Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs based on the context provided, which is "Geologia" (Geology). The user wants the CSV format with each pair separated by a semicolon. Let me start by recalling the main topics in geology that could be covered here.

First, I should think about fundamental concepts. Maybe start with the definition of geology. That's a basic question. Then move on to different types of rocks, like igneous, sedimentary, and metamorphic. I need to make sure each question is unique and covers different aspects.

Next, tectonic plates and their movement could be another area. Maybe ask about the theory of plate tectonics. Then, geological time scales, like the different eras. Earthquakes and their causes are important too. Volcanoes and their formation, mineral resources, and maybe some geological processes like erosion or weathering.

I need to ensure that each answer is directly from the context or can be inferred. Avoid repetition. Let me check each question to see if they are distinct. For example, one question on rock types, another on plate tectonics, another on the geological time scale, and so on. 

Wait, the user specified that the answers must be explicitly or inferentially present in the context. Since the context is just "Geologia," I need to make sure that the questions are general enough but still related to common geological topics. Maybe I should list out key topics in geology and create questions around them.

Another point: the answers should be correct. For example, if I ask about the three main types of rocks, the answer should be igneous, sedimentary, and metamorphic. For the theory of plate tectonics, the answer would be the movement of Earth's lithosphere. 

Let me count the questions I have so far: definition, rock types, tectonic plates, geological time scale, earthquakes, volcanoes, minerals, erosion, sedimentation, and geologic structures. That's 10. Now, I need to phrase each question clearly and concisely, ensuring that each answer is accurate and directly related to the question.

I should also check for any possible repetition. For example, if I have a question about earthquakes and another about volcanoes, they are different. Each covers a distinct aspect. Now, translating these into Portuguese, making sure the terminology is correct. 

Finally, format them into the CSV structure as specified, with each pair separated by a semicolon and no additional text. Let me review each pair to ensure they meet all the requirements.
