Okay, I need to generate 10 CSV pairs based on the provided context and facts about Harvard University. Let me start by understanding the user's requirements. They want each question to be varied and cover different aspects of the content. The answers must be correct and directly inferable from the text.

First, I'll go through the context to extract key points. Harvard is a private university in Cambridge, MA, part of Ivy League, founded in 1636, named after John Harvard. It's the oldest in the US, secularized over time, became a research university after the Civil War, merged with Radcliffe in 1977, has 11 academic units, campus locations, notable alumni, Nobel laureates, etc.

Now, the facts list many individuals associated with Harvard, like alumni, employees, etc. I need to create questions that ask about these associations. But I should vary the types of questions. For example, some could ask about founding, others about notable alumni, campus locations, historical events, rankings, etc.

Let me check the facts again. There are numerous names with different relations: alma mater, locais de trabalho, instituição de trabalho, etc. I need to make sure each question is unique and covers different aspects. For example:

1. Who founded Harvard University? Answer: John Harvard.
2. When was Harvard University founded? Answer: 1636.
3. What is the main campus location? Answer: Cambridge, Massachusetts.
4. Who was the first female president? Answer: Drew Gilpin Faust.
5. Which notable alumni are mentioned? Like presidents, Nobel laureates, etc.
6. What is Harvard's ranking? Answer: USNWR mundial 1.
7. What is the total budget? Answer: 30 bilhões de dólares.
8. What is the name of the library? Answer: Biblioteca da Universidade de Harvard.
9. Which sports does Harvard compete in? Answer: 42 esportes intercolegiais.
10. Who is the current president? Wait, the context mentions Drew Gilpin Faust as the 28th president in 2007, but the current one isn't specified. Maybe avoid that if unsure.

Wait, the facts list many people, but the context mentions that Drew Gilpin Faust was elected in 2007 and is the first woman. However, the current president isn't given in the context. So maybe avoid a question about the current president. Instead, focus on other aspects.

Also, the facts include people with alma mater, locais de trabalho, etc. Maybe some questions can be about specific individuals. For example, "Who is an example of a Harvard alumnus?" Answer: John F. Kennedy (though not in the facts, but the context mentions eight US presidents). Wait, the context says eight presidents formed there, but the facts list several names like Everett Mendelsohn, etc. However, the user might expect questions based on the facts provided, not the context. Wait, the user said to generate based on the context and facts provided. So perhaps some questions can be about the people in the facts. For example, "Which individual is associated with Harvard University as a alma mater?" Answer: Everett Mendelsohn. But the user wants questions related to the context, not the facts. Wait, the instruction says to generate based on the context and facts. So maybe the questions should be about the facts, but the context is the main source. Hmm, the user provided both context and facts, but the main content is the context. The facts are additional data points.

Wait, the user's instruction says: "Gere pares de perguntas e respostas relevantes e corretas, exclusivamente a partir do conteúdo fornecido." So the content provided includes both the context and the facts. So I can use both. For example, the facts list many people, so I can create questions about them. But the user wants varied questions. Let me structure the questions:

1. Who founded Harvard University? (from context)
2. When was Harvard University founded? (from context)
3. What is the main campus location? (from context)
4. Who was the first female president? (from context)
5. What is Harvard's ranking? (from context)
6. What is the total budget? (from context)
7. What is the name of the library? (from context)
8. Which sports does Harvard compete in? (from context)
9. Which notable alumni are mentioned? (from context)
10. Which individual is associated with Harvard University as a alma mater? (from facts)

Wait, but the user wants the answers to be explicitly from the context. The facts are additional data, but maybe they are part of the content. However, the user might expect the questions to be based on the context, not the facts. Let me check the user's example. The example includes questions about the founding, location, etc., which are from the context. The facts list people associated with Harvard, but the user might not want questions about specific individuals unless the context mentions them. However, the user's instruction says to use the content provided, which includes both context and facts. Therefore, perhaps the questions can be about the facts, but the answers must be inferred from the content. For example, the fact says "Everett Mendelsohn pertence à instituição Harvard University" so a question could be "Quem pertence à instituição Harvard University?" with answer "Everett Mendelsohn". But the user wants the questions to be varied and cover different aspects. However, the user's example in the instruction shows that the questions are about the context, not the facts. Wait, the user's instruction says: "Gere pares de perguntas e respostas relevantes e corretas, exclusivamente a partir do conteúdo fornecido." So the content includes both the context and the facts. Therefore, I can use the facts to create questions. For example:

1. Quem pertence à instituição Harvard University? Resposta: Everett Mendelsohn.
2. Qual é o ranking de Harvard University? Resposta: USNWR mundial 1.
3. Qual é o nome da biblioteca da universidade? Resposta: Biblioteca da Universidade de Harvard.
4. Quando foi fundada a Universidade Harvard? Resposta: 1636.
5. Quem foi o primeiro presidente feminino da universidade? Resposta: Drew Gilpin Faust.
6. Qual é o local principal da universidade? Resposta: Cambridge, Massachusetts.
7. Qual é o total do orçamento da universidade? Resposta: 30 bilhões de dólares.
8. Quais esportes a universidade compete? Resposta: 42 esportes intercolegiais.
9. Quem é um exemplo de aluno da universidade? Resposta: Alguns presidentes dos EUA.
10. Qual é o tipo de entidade da universidade? Resposta: YagoPermanentlyLocatedEntity.

Wait, but the user might not want to include all the facts. However, the user provided both context and facts, so it's acceptable. However, the user's example in the instruction shows that the questions are about the context, not the facts. Let me check the user's example again. The user says "Gere agora os 10 pares pergunta;resposta conforme as instruções e regras acima." So I need to make sure that the questions are based on the context and the facts, but the answers must be directly inferable from the content. Let me proceed to create 10 questions, mixing context and facts, ensuring variety.
