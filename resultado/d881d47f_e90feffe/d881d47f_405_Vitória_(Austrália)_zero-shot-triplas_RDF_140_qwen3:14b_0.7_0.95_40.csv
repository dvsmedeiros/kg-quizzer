Looking at the data, there's a lot of triples in RDF format. Each line has a subject, predicate, and object. For example, "<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Victoria_(Australia)> a ns1:PopulatedPlace ;" means Victoria is a populated place. Then there are various predicates like ns2:populationDensityKm with the value "28", and foaf:depiction pointing to Wikimedia images.
