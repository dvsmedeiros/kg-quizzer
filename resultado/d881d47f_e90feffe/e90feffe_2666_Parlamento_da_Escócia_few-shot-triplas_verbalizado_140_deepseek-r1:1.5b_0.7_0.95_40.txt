Okay, I need to create 10 pairs of "pergunta" and "resposta" based on the provided context and rules. Let me go through each aspect step by step.

First, I'll review the context given. It's about the Scottish Parliament with various facts and stats. The key elements include socialists, MSPs, political divisions, regulations, historical events like the First World War, and recent legislative changes. 

I remember that the rules state that each pair should have a question (within quotes) followed by a response, separated by semicolons. No markdown or explanations except using \; to create semicolons.

Looking at the context, I'll identify different aspects:

1. Socialists in Scotland
2. First Minister of Scotland's position
3. Scottish Parliament regulations
4. MSPs' roles
5. Historical event summary
6. National Identity and community
7. Public debates on Scotland
8. Current legislative changes for Scotland
9. Categories of issues
10. Recent legislative updates

Now, I'll generate questions based on these aspects and provide corresponding responses.

   - Question: Whom do socialist parties in Scotland represent?
   - Response: Royal Scottish Mint.
