Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the provided context and facts. Let me start by understanding the content thoroughly.

The context explains the immune system's role in protecting the body, mentions Ilya Mechnikov as the founder, and discusses various components like phagocytosis, defensins, complement system, and adaptive immunity. It also touches on disorders like autoimmunity and immunodeficiency, and the field of immunology.

The facts provided are in RDF format, listing entities related to the immune system, such as B cells, T cells, macrophages, and others. There are also mentions of people like César Milstein and Lajos Kemény, and conditions like food allergies and sepsis linked to the immune system.

Now, I need to create varied questions covering different aspects. Let me brainstorm possible questions:

1. Who is considered the father of immunology? (Answer: Ilya Ilyich Mechnikov)
2. What is the role of the immune system? (Answer: Protect against diseases)
3. What is the term for the immune system's memory? (Answer: Immunological memory)
4. Which cells are part of the adaptive immune system? (Answer: B cells, T cells)
5. What is the medical cause of sepsis? (Answer: Immune system)
6. What is the function of defensins? (Answer: Antimicrobial peptides)
7. Which disorder results from an overactive immune system? (Answer: Autoimmune disease)
8. What is the primary function of phagocytosis? (Answer: Engulf pathogens)
9. What is the basis of vaccination? (Answer: Acquired immunity)
10. Which cells are involved in the innate immune response? (Answer: Neutrophils, macrophages)

Wait, need to ensure each question is unique and covers different aspects. Let me check if these are all distinct and based on the facts. Also, ensure answers are directly from the text. For example, the facts mention "Natural_killer_cell" and "Macrophage" as part of the immune system, so questions about those components would be valid.

Let me structure each pair, making sure the answers are correct and derived from the context. Avoid repetition and ensure the questions are varied. Now, format them into CSV as specified.
