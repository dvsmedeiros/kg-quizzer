Ok, I need to create 10 objective questions and answers based on the provided context about the 1973 oil crisis. The user has given me a lot of data in the form of facts about the crisis, including events, causes, effects, related conflicts, etc.

First, I'll go through each fact to identify key information that can be turned into questions and answers. Since the questions need to be varied but relevant, I should cover different aspects like what happened, why it happened, its impact, related policies, and so on.

I'll start by identifying 10 distinct topics from the facts provided:

1. Timing of the embargo
2. Countries affected
3. Price increase details
4. Start and end dates of the crisis
5. Causes (Yom Kippur War)
6. Impact on the global economy
7. Response actions taken
8. Long-term effects
9. Effects on inflation and GDP
10. Mitigation efforts

Now, for each topic, I'll formulate a question that directly asks about it using one of the facts provided.

For example, the first fact states that the embargo started in October 1973, so the question can be asking when it began.

Similarly, for the impact on prices, the fact mentions the price increased from $3 to over $12 per barrel, so I'll create a question about the price increase.

I need to ensure that each answer is a single correct response based on the facts given and avoid any unnecessary details. Also, all answers should be in Portuguese since the user requested it.

Let me go through each point systematically:

1. **Timing**: When did the 1973 oil crisis start? Answer: October 1973.
2. **Countries**: Which countries were part of the embargo? Answer: Canada, Japan,荷兰达, Reino Unido, Estados Unidos.
3. **Prices**: What was the price increase during the crisis? Answer: De US$ 3 para mais de US$ 12 por barril.
4. **Dates**: When did the crisis end? Answer: Março de 1974.
5. **Causes**: What led to the crisis? Answer: O Yom Kippur War.
6. **Economic Impact**: How did the crisis affect global oil production? Answer: A produção petrolífera do mundo aumentou.
7. **Response**: What were the actions taken during the crisis? Answer: Atalhos de petróleo foram estabelecidos.
8. **Long-term Effects**: What was one long-term impact of the crisis? Answer: elevou o preço do petróleo no mundo inteiro.
9. **Inflation and GDP**: How did the crisis affect inflation and GDP? Answer: Aumentou os preços, afetando a inflação e a economia.
10. **Mitigation**: What was attempted to reduce the crisis? Answer: AmBIguationes.

I think these cover 10 distinct areas related to the 1973 oil crisis and each question has a clear answer based on the provided facts without any additional information.
