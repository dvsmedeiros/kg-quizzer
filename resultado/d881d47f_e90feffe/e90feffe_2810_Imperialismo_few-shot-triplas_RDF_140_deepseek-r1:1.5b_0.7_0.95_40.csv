pergunta;resposta
I should also consider the format: each pair has "pergunta;resposta" separated by a semicolon and comma-separated. The data needs to be clean without any additional comments.
I need to make sure that I don't repeat questions, so each pair must have unique content. Also, the answers should be explicit or implied; for example, if a question is about the cause of the term, the answer could be its origin in Latin.
