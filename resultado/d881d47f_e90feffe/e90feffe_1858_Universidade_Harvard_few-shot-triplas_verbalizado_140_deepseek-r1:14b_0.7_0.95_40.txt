Alright, let's see what the user is asking for here. They want me to generate quiz questions based on a given context about Harvard University. The output needs to be in CSV format with exactly 10 pairs of questions and answers.

First, I should review the provided context thoroughly. It includes historical facts, notable individuals associated with Harvard, key events, and statistics. I need to extract relevant information from this to create varied and distinct quiz questions.

I notice that the examples provided include questions about specific individuals, dates, and university rankings. So, I'll aim for a mix of these topics to ensure diversity in the quiz.

Let me list out possible question topics: famous alumni, historical events, locations, notable people associated with Harvard, and university rankings or unique facts.

Now, I'll go through the context again to identify key points:

1. Founding year: 1636.
2. First benefactor: John Harvard.
3. Harvard Yard location in Cambridge.
4. Graduation becoming coeducational in 1977 after merging with Radcliffe College.
5. James Conant's leadership during the Great Depression and WWII.
6. Drew Gilpin Faust as the first female president.
7. Harvard Crimson sports teams compete in 42 intercollegiate sports.
8. University ranking: top globally according to USNWR.
9. Notable alumni include eight U.S. presidents, 150 Nobel laureates, and many billionaires.

With these points, I can structure questions around each. For example:

- A question about the first benefactor's name.
- The year the graduate school became coeducational.
- Who led Harvard during the Great Depression?
- Harvard's global ranking.
- How many sports teams compete in intercollegiate events?

I'll make sure each question is unique and covers different aspects. I'll also ensure that the answers are directly supported by the provided context to maintain accuracy.

Let me start drafting the questions:

1. Who was Harvard University named after? John Harvard.
2. When did the graduate school become coeducational? 1977.
3. Who transformed Harvard into a research university? Charles W. Eliot.
4. Where is Harvard's main campus located? Cambridge, Massachusetts.
5. How many sports does Harvard's team compete in? 42.

Continuing with more questions about notable figures and achievements:

6. Which Ivy League university has the highest global ranking? Harvard.
7. Who was the first female president of Harvard? Drew Gilpin Faust.
8. What is Harvard's sports team name? Harvard Crimson.
9. How many Nobel laureates are associated with Harvard? 150.
10. Since when has Harvard been a member of the AAU? 1900.

I think these cover a good range, from history to notable achievements and current stats. Each answer is directly pulled from the context, ensuring they're correct. I'll format them into CSV as required, making sure each line follows "pergunta;resposta" without any additional text.
