Ok, let me try to figure out how to approach this query. The user wants me to generate a quiz with 10 objective questions and answers based on the provided context about the immune system.

First, I need to understand the structure they want. They specified that each question should have a unique answer embedded directly in the content or inferred from it. Also, each pair is separated by a semicolon and presented in CSV format without any additional text.

Looking at the context, there's a lot of information about different components of the immune system like T cells, B cells, dendritic cells, etc., along with some health conditions related to the immune system. My task is to extract key points from these sections and formulate questions based on them.

I should start by identifying 10 distinct aspects or facts from the context that I can turn into questions. For each fact, I'll create a question that asks about it and then provide the answer directly from the context.

For example, one of the context points mentions that White blood cell is part of the immune system. So, my first question could be asking which body part contains white blood cells, with the answer being the immune system.

Next, I'll continue this process for other components like lymphocytes and monocytes since they are also mentioned in the context. Each time, making sure that each question targets a different aspect to cover a broad range of information.

I need to ensure that all 10 questions are varied and cover different parts of the immune system as well as related health topics, such as autoimmune diseases or immune deficiency. This way, the quiz will be comprehensive and test various knowledge points about the immune system.

Also, I must adhere strictly to the formatting rules: each question-response pair separated by a semicolon within the CSV structure without any extra text or explanations.

After listing out all 10 questions with their respective answers based on the context, I'll compile them into the required CSV format. Making sure that there are no duplicates and each entry is correctly formatted.
