Okay, so I need to generate 10 question and answer pairs based on the provided context and facts about prime numbers. Let me start by understanding what's given.

First, the context explains that a prime number is defined as having exactly two distinct natural divisors: 1 and itself. It also mentions twin primes, which are pairs of primes differing by two, like (3,5), (5,7), etc. The document also talks about Euclid proving there are infinitely many primes, the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic, and some specific examples of prime numbers less than 1000.

Looking at the facts section, it lists several numbers as having "fatoração Prime number," which I assume means they're prime. There's also information about OEIS sequences, images related to primes, templates used on Wikipedia pages, and notable people associated with primes like Heinrich Scherk and Landon Curt Noll.

I need to create varied questions covering different aspects without repeating similar ones. Each question must have a single correct answer derived from the context or facts. Let me brainstorm some potential topics:

1. Definition of prime numbers.
2. Twin primes and examples.
3. Euclid's proof of infinite primes.
4. Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic.
5. Specific primes listed in the context (e.g., 103, 47).
6. OEIS references for prime numbers.
7. Images associated with prime number pages.
8. Wikipedia templates used for prime articles.
9. Notable figures known for their work on primes.
10. Number of prime numbers less than a certain value.

Now, I'll draft each question and ensure the answers are accurate based on the provided information.

For example, one question could be about the definition of a prime number, with the answer being that they have exactly two distinct natural divisors: 1 and themselves.

Another question might ask for examples of twin primes, referencing the pairs given in the context.

I should also include questions about specific facts, like which OEIS sequence is associated with prime numbers or who is known for work on primes.

Let me ensure each answer directly corresponds to the information provided. I'll avoid making up answers and stick strictly to what's given.
