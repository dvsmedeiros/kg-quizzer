Okay, the user wants me to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the provided context and facts about the Black Death. Let me start by carefully reading through the context and the list of facts to ensure I cover different aspects without repeating.

First, the Black Death is a pandemic that killed 75-200 million people in Eurasia. I should make a question about the estimated death toll. Then, the cause is Yersinia pestis leading to different forms of plague, so a question on that. The origin is in Central or Eastern Asia via the Silk Road, so another question on that. The spread through rats and fleas is important, so a question about the transmission method.

Next, the impact on Europe's population, like 30-60% mortality, and the recovery time. The role of Genoese merchants in spreading it. The different forms of plague, like pneumonic. The historical significance, such as the seventh year after it began in England. The use of the term "Black Death" as a name. The time period, 1346. The medical aspect, like the bubonic plague. The cultural impact, such as the Dance of Death. The historical context, like the 14th-century health disasters. 

Wait, I need to make sure each question is unique and covers different aspects. Let me check if I have 10 distinct points. The user mentioned 10 pairs, so I need to ensure each is a separate topic. Also, the answers must be directly from the context. Let me list them out:

1. Death toll
2. Cause (Yersinia pestis)
3. Origin
4. Transmission method (fleas on rats)
5. Population impact in Europe
6. Recovery time
7. Role of Genoese merchants
8. Different forms of plague
9. Historical event in England
10. Term "Black Death"

That's 10. Now, I need to phrase each question clearly and ensure the answers are accurate based on the context. Also, check that no questions are repeated and that each answer is correct. For example, the answer to the origin question is Central or Eastern Asia. The transmission is via fleas on rats. The answer for the different forms includes pneumonic. The answer for the seventh year in England is from the given citation. The term "Black Death" is the name. The time period is 1346. The medical aspect is bubonic plague. The cultural impact is the Dance of Death. 

I should make sure all these are correctly represented in the CSV format without any markdown, just the CSV with the pairs. Let me structure each line as per the example, using semicolons and ensuring the answers are concise and correct.
