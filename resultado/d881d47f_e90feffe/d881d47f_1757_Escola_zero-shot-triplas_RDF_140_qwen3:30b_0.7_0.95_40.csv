But wait; the user example shows the answer as "Private school" and the question as "What type of school is [Name]?" So I can follow that structure.
Now; I need to pick 10 different entries from the list. Let me scan through the list and select 10 unique school names.
3. St. Mary's High School (Storm Lake; Iowa)
6. Trinity High School (Dickinson; North Dakota)
10. St. Mary of the Sea College; Corunna
- St. Mary's High School (Storm Lake; Iowa)
- Trinity High School (Dickinson; North Dakota)
- St. Mary of the Sea College; Corunna
That's 10. Now; form the questions:
3. What type of school is St. Mary's High School (Storm Lake; Iowa)?
6. What type of school is Trinity High School (Dickinson; North Dakota)?
10. What type of school is St. Mary of the Sea College; Corunna?
I think this covers the requirements. Now; format them as per the user's example.
