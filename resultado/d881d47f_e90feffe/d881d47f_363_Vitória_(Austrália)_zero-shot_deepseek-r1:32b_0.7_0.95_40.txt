Okay, so I need to create a quiz about Victoria, Australia. The user has given me some context and specific instructions on how the questions should be structured.

First, I'll go through the provided information step by step. The content mentions that Victoria is a state in southeast Australia, bordered by New South Wales and South Australia. It also notes that it's surrounded by the Tasman Sea to the east and Bass Strait to the south. Melbourne is the capital city, which has significant cultural landmarks like the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG) and the Royal Botanic Gardens. The Great Ocean Road is a popular tourist destination there.

I should make sure each question covers different aspects of this information to keep it varied. Let's think about possible questions:

1. What is Victoria? – That's straightforward.
2. Where is it located in Australia? – Southeast, as mentioned.
3. Which states border it? – New South Wales and South Australia.
4. What seas surround it? – Tasman Sea and Bass Strait.
5. What is the capital city? – Melbourne.
6. What landmarks are in Melbourne? – MCG and Royal Botanic Gardens.
7. Who were the first inhabitants? – The Gunditjmara people.
8. When was Victoria declared a state? – 1901.
9. How many national parks does it have? – Over 4,500.
10. What's a famous tourist attraction? – Great Ocean Road.

I need to ensure each question has only one correct answer and that they don't repeat similar topics. I'll structure them in Portuguese as per the instructions and format everything into CSV without any additional commentary.

Now, I'll write out these questions and their corresponding answers in the required format.
