Okay, I need to generate 10 pairs of questions and answers in CSV format based on the provided context and facts about Warsaw. Let me start by carefully reading through the context and the list of facts to make sure I understand all the key points.

First, the context gives a lot of information about Warsaw: it's the capital of Poland, located by the Vistula River, population in 2012, industries, universities, historical significance, the Holocaust, the rebuilding after WWII, UNESCO heritage site, the Pact of Warsaw, etc. The facts list a bunch of people born or died in Warsaw, places in Warsaw, events, and some statistics like population, weather, etc.

I need to create 10 unique questions that cover different aspects. Let me go through the facts and see what I can extract. 

Looking at the facts, there are several people associated with Warsaw: Stanisław Mazur, Władysław Zieliński, Zygmunt Chmielewski, Sigismund's Column, Ida Nowakowska, Hubert Wagner, Adolf Dygasiński, etc. So maybe some questions can be about these individuals. Also, there are places like the Sigismund Column, the Barbakan, the Castle, the Warsaw Uprising, the rebuilding, the UNESCO site, the Pact of Warsaw, the Frontex, the weather stats, the population, the universities, the sports teams, the TV channels, etc.

I need to make sure the questions are varied and not repeating the same type. Let me think of different categories: historical events, people, places, statistics, institutions, cultural aspects, etc.

Let me start listing possible questions:

1. Who is the person who died in Warsaw? (Looking at the list, there are several names, so maybe pick one)
2. What is the name of the column located in Warsaw? (Sigismund's Column)
3. What is the population of Warsaw in 2012? (1,716,855)
4. Which river is Warsaw located by? (Vistula)
5. What is the nickname of Warsaw? (Phoenix City)
6. What is the name of the TV channel with its headquarters in Warsaw? (Discovery Channel)
7. Which event is associated with Warsaw being called the "Paris of the North"? (Before WWII)
8. What is the name of the university in Warsaw? (University of Warsaw)
9. What is the main area of Warsaw that is a UNESCO heritage site? (Historic Centre)
10. Which international organization has its headquarters in Warsaw? (Frontex)

Wait, but the user provided examples where some answers are not fully filled. For example, in the example, one question is "Qual é a classificação da cidade mais populosa da União Europeia em Varsóvia?" and the answer is empty. But according to the context, Warsaw is the capital and the largest city, but the example answer is left blank. However, the user's instruction says that answers must be correct and derived from the context. So I need to make sure that all answers are accurate based on the given facts.

Wait, in the context, it says that in 2012, the The Economist Intelligence Unit ranked Warsaw as the 32nd most livable city. So that's a fact. Also, the population in 2012 was 1,716,855. The Sigismund's Column is in Warsaw. The Frontex is based in Warsaw. The Historic Centre is a UNESCO site. The Pact of Warsaw is associated with Warsaw. The Warsaw Uprising is a historical event. The weather stats like precipitation, humidity, etc., are given.

So, I need to make sure that each question has a correct answer from the facts. Let me check each of the possible questions I thought of:

1. Who died in Warsaw? (e.g., Stanisław Mazur)
2. What is the name of the column? (Sigismund's Column)
3. Population in 2012: 1,717,855 (but the exact number is 1,716,855 as per the context)
4. River: Vistula
5. Nickname: Phoenix City
6. TV channel: Discovery Channel (Polish TV channel)
7. Historical nickname: Paris of the North
8. University: University of Warsaw
9. UNESCO site: Historic Centre
10. Frontex (UN agency)

But I need to make sure that the answers are in the context. Let me check each fact again.

The context mentions the population in 2012 as 1,716,855. Yes. The river is Vistula. The nickname Phoenix City is mentioned in the context. The Sigismund's Column is in Warsaw. The Historic Centre is a UNESCO site. The Frontex is based in Warsaw. The TV channel is Discovery Channel. The university is the University of Warsaw. The nickname "Paris of the North" is mentioned in the context. The Frontex is the EU agency for border security.

So, these questions are all valid. Now, I need to ensure that the 10 questions are unique and cover different aspects. Let me make sure I don't repeat the same type. For example, the example had a question about the population, so I can use that. Also, the example had a question about the nickname, so I can use that as well.

Another thing: some of the facts are about specific events or people, so maybe include those. For example, the Warsaw Uprising (1944) is a major event in the city's history. Also, the 1944 Uprising is a key historical event. But the context doesn't mention the Uprising directly, but the facts do have "Battle of Praga" located in Warsaw. However, the context mentions the Warsaw Uprising as part of the historical significance.

Wait, the context says: "in 1944, the Warsaw Uprising began, which was a significant event in the city's history." So that's a fact. So a question about the historical event could be: Which historical event took place in Warsaw in 1944? Answer: Warsaw Uprising.

But I need to check if that's in the facts. The fact list includes "Battle of Praga está localizado em Warsaw" which is a different event. However, the context does mention the Warsaw Uprising. So that's a valid question.

So, I can include that as a question. Let me make sure that all answers are in the context or the facts.

Now, let me list the 10 questions and answers, ensuring they are unique and based on the facts.

1. Who is the person who died in Warsaw? (e.g., Stanisław Mazur)
2. What is the name of the column located in Warsaw? (Sigismund's Column)
3. What is the population of Warsaw in 2012? (1,716,855)
4. Which river is Warsaw located by? (Vistula)
5. What is the nickname of Warsaw? (Phoenix City)
6. What is the name of the TV channel with its headquarters in Warsaw? (Discovery Channel)
7. What is the historical nickname of Warsaw? (Paris of the North)
8. What is the name of the university in Warsaw? (University of Warsaw)
9. What is the name of the UNESCO heritage site in Warsaw? (Historic Centre)
10. Which international organization has its headquarters in Warsaw? (Frontex)

Alternatively, I can use the Battle of Praga as a question, but the user might prefer more general questions. Also, the example had a question about the population, so that's covered. I need to make sure all answers are in the facts.

Wait, the example had a question about the population, but the answer was left blank. But according to the context, the answer is 1,716,855. So I need to include that.

Another fact is the Warsaw Uprising, so that's a valid question. Also, the weather stats: precipitation in March is 29 mm, humidity in September is 79.5%, etc. But maybe those are too specific. The user might prefer general questions.

I think the 10 questions I listed above are sufficient. Let me check again:

1. Who is the person who died in Warsaw? (e.g., Stanisław Mazur)
2. What is the name of the column located in Warsaw? (Sigismund's Column)
3. What is the population of Warsaw in 2012? (1,716,855)
4. Which river is Warsaw located by? (Vistula)
5. What is the nickname of Warsaw? (Phoenix City)
6. What is the name of the TV channel with its headquarters in Warsaw? (Discovery Channel)
7. What is the historical nickname of Warsaw? (Paris of the North)
8. What is the name of the university in Warsaw? (University of Warsaw)
9. What is the name of the UNESCO heritage site in Warsaw? (Historic Centre)
10. Which international organization has its headquarters in Warsaw? (Frontex)

Yes, these are all valid. Now, I need to format them into the CSV with the correct answers.
