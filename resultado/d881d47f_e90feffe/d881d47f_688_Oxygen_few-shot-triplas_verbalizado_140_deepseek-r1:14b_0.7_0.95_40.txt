Okay, so I need to create 10 multiple-choice questions based on the provided information about oxygen. Let me read through the context and facts carefully.

First, the context is quite detailed. It talks about oxygen's atomic number, symbol, properties, abundance in the universe and Earth's crust, its role in the atmosphere, biological importance, discovery, and various applications.

The facts section includes some Wikipedia template usages and other related information, but I think the key details are in the context provided.

I need to make sure each question is unique and covers different aspects of oxygen. Let me jot down possible topics: atomic number, symbol, group in periodic table, abundance, atmospheric composition, physical properties, chemical reactivity, biological role, discovery, and applications.

Now, I'll start forming questions based on these topics:

1. What's the atomic number of oxygen? - From context, it's 8.
2. What is oxygen's symbol? - O.
3. Which group does oxygen belong to? - Chalcogens or calcogénio in Portuguese.
4. What's oxygen's state at room temperature? - Diatomic gas (O2).
5. Who discovered oxygen? - Priestley and Scheele, but the answer can be either since it might not specify who published first.
6. What percentage does oxygen make up in Earth's atmosphere? - 20.8%.
7. Which element has the highest electronegativity after fluorine? - Oxygen.
8. What is a key use of oxygen? - In steel production, maybe.
9. How much of Earth's crust mass is oxygen? - Almost half.
10. What's the name of the allotrope that protects us from UV? - Ozone.

Wait, I need to make sure each question has only one correct answer and is clear. Let me double-check:

- For question 5, since both scientists discovered it, but commonly Priestley is cited because his work was published first. So the answer should be him.
- For question 9, the context says oxygen constitutes almost half of the Earth's crust mass as part of water and other compounds.

I think these cover a variety of aspects without repetition. Now, I'll structure them into CSV format with each line as "pergunta;resposta".
