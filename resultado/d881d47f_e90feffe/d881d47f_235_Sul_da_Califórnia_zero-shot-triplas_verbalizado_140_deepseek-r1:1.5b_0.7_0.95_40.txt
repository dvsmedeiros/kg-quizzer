Okay, I need to create a CSV with 10 pairs of questions and answers based on the given context and facts. Let me go through each piece of information step by step.

First, I see that Southern California is a significant region in SoCal. It's known for its beaches, mountains, and various attractions. The population is around 23 million in 2019. That could be a good starting point for one question about the population size.

Next, facts like Fedco being at the top of Southern California indicate economic prominence there. I can use this information to create another question on economic status.

The region has multiple subdivisions and notable locations. For example, Kern County is part of Southern California, so that's a good fact for a question about specific counties within the state.

I also notice that the region encompasses areas like Los Angeles, San Diego, and Santa Barbara, which are major cities in SoCal. This could be useful to include as information for questions about cities or landmarks.

There are several attractions like the Pacific Ocean, I-805 highway, and the beach at Venice Beach. These can serve as potential questions about features of the region.

The facts mention places like California Avocado Society and the American Museum of Southern California, which could be used to create factual questions about organizations or historical sites.

I should avoid repeating any information beyond what's provided. Each question and answer pair must be unique based on the given context. I'll make sure each point from the facts or context is clearly translated into a question-answering pair in the CSV format.

Finally, ensuring that the CSV structure is correct with headers 'pergunta' and 'resposta', separated by semicolons, and exactly 10 lines. No extra data or comments should be present.
