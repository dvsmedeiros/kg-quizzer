Okay, I need to generate 10 pairs of questions and correct answers in Portuguese based on the given context about Fresno. Let me start by understanding what Fresno is.

Fresno is a city in California known for its agricultural productions like grapes, almonds, and citrus fruits. It's also famous for its festivals, especially the Fresno Grange Fair, which is one of the largest fairgrounds events in the U.S.

So, I should create questions that cover different aspects of Fresno: agriculture, cultural events, geography, history, economy, etc. Each question should have a unique angle and be directly related to the provided context.

Let me think about each aspect:

1. **Agriculture**: What is Fresno known for? Maybe something about its crops.
2. **Cultural Events**: What major event happens there?
3. **Geography**: Where is Fresno located?
4. **History/Founding**: When was it founded or established?
5. **Economy**: What industries are significant in Fresno?
6. **Education**: What's a notable educational institution nearby?
7. **Climate**: What kind of climate does Fresno have?
8. **Festivals**: Are there other festivals besides the Grange Fair? Maybe something related to wine since it's known for grapes.
9. **Parks**: Does Fresno have a significant park or landmark?
10. **Nickname/Location**: What is Fresno's nickname? Or perhaps its location relative to other cities.

Wait, I should ensure each question has only one correct answer and that the answers are directly inferred from the context given. I need to make sure not to repeat similar questions.

Let me list out possible questions:

1. Which major crops are Fresnans known for?
2. What is Fresno's most famous festival?
3. Where is Fresno located in California?
4. In what year was Fresno incorporated as a city?
5. What is the primary economic sector in Fresno?
6. What university or college is associated with Fresno?
7. What is Fresno's average annual rainfall?
8. Which major wine event occurs in Fresno?
9. Is there a significant historical building or park in Fresno?
10. What nickname does Fresno have?

Now, I'll assign correct answers based on the context:

1. The major crops are grapes, almonds, and citrus fruits.
2. The Fresno Grange Fair is the largest agricultural fairgrounds event in the U.S.
3. Fresno is located in the San Joaquin Valley, near Fresno County.
4. Fresno was incorporated in 1885.
5. The primary economic sector is agriculture, especially in almonds and grapes.
6. Fresno State University is a notable institution.
7. Fresno has a Mediterranean climate with warm, dry summers and mild winters.
8. The Fresno Area Wine Festival is another event related to its grape production.
9. The Fresno Historical Museum might be a significant place or building.
10. Fresno is sometimes referred to as the "Fruit Basket of the World."

I think this covers various angles without overlapping too much. I should format these into CSV pairs now.
