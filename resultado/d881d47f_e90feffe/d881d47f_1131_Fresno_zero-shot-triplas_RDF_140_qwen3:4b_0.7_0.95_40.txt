Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs based on the provided data about Fresno, California. Let me start by understanding the data thoroughly.

First, the data includes various entities related to Fresno, such as places, people, organizations, and statistics. The main entity is "Fresno, California," which is a city in California. There are multiple properties and attributes associated with it, like area, population, population density, population demonym, and more. Also, there are other entities like radio stations, sports teams, historical events, and people born or died there.

Looking at the data, I can extract key pieces of information. For example, the population of Fresno is mentioned as 1008654 (metro population), the area is 300.43 km², and the population density is 1823.43 km². The population demonym is "Fresnan." There are also several radio stations and TV stations located in Fresno. Additionally, there are historical events, people, and organizations associated with the city.

Now, I need to form 10 question-answer pairs. Each question should be a concise query about a specific piece of information from the data. The answers should be direct and based on the data provided. Let me list out possible questions:

1. What is the population of Fresno, California?
2. What is the population demonym for Fresno?
3. What is the area of Fresno, California in square kilometers?
4. What is the population density of Fresno, California?
5. Which radio stations are located in Fresno?
6. What is the metro population of Fresno?
7. What are some notable historical events or people associated with Fresno?
8. What are the major landmarks or places in Fresno?
9. What is the area total of Fresno, California?
10. What is the population density in square miles for Fresno?

I need to check if these questions are covered in the data. For example, the first question can be answered by the population metro value. The population demonym is given as "Fresnan." The area is 300.43 km², and the population density is 1823.43 km². The metro population is 1,008,654. The radio stations include KSKS, KRZR, KWRU, KWYE, etc. For historical events, there's the murder of Jill Ann Weatherwax, and notable people like Tom Seaver. Landmarks include Selland Arena, Warnors Theatre, and the Big Fresno Fair.

I should make sure each answer is accurate and based on the data. Also, the questions should be in Portuguese, as per the user's instructions. Let me translate the questions and ensure the answers are correctly formatted.
