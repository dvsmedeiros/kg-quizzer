Okay, so I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs based on the given context and facts about British Satellite Broadcasting (BSB). Let me go through each step carefully.

First, I'll read through all the provided information to understand what's available. The context mentions that BSB was a TV company in London providing satellite transmissions, founded in December 1986, and merged with Sky Television in November 1990 to form BSkyB, starting broadcasts on March 25, 1990.

Looking at the facts, there's a lot of detailed information: categories, templates used on Wikipedia pages, types like Institution, SocialGroup, Agent, etc. It also mentions hardware films produced and studios used, ownership of various TV channels like Galaxy, The Movie Channel, The Power Station, and others. There are details about images, locations (like London and England), and some film productions.

Now, I need to create 10 varied questions covering different aspects without repeating similar ones. Each question should have a clear correct answer from the given data. Let's brainstorm possible angles:

1. **Foundation Date**: When was BSB founded?
2. **Merger Details**: What company did BSB merge with and when?
3. **Broadcast Start**: When did BSB begin broadcasting?
4. **Headquarters Location**: Where was BSB based?
5. **Ownership of Channels**: Which channels were owned by BSB?
6. **Produced Films**: What films were produced by BSB?
7. **Images Used**: What images represent BSB?
8. **Categories and Types**: Under which categories does BSB fall?
9. **Company Status**: Was BSB a defunct company?
10. **Merged Entity Name**: What was the name after merging with Sky Television?

Let me check each against the facts to ensure accuracy.

1. Founded in December 1986.
2. Merged with Sky Television in November 1990 to form BSkyB.
3. Started broadcasting on March 25, 1990.
4. Based in London, specifically at Marco Polo House.
5. Owned channels like Galaxy, The Movie Channel, The Power Station, Now, and The Computer Channel (BSB).
6. Produced films such as Hardware, Memphis Belle, and Heil Honey I'm Home!
7. Images include Marco Polo House cropped version, BSBDishes.jpg, Squarial2.jpg, and the BSB logo.
8. Categories include British companies from 1986, mass media, defunct companies, etc., types like Company, Organisation, LegalActor.
9. Yes, it was defunct as indicated by categories about disestablishment in 1990.
10. After merger, the company became BSkyB.

I think these cover a broad range of aspects without repetition. Each question is distinct and targets different information points from the provided data.
