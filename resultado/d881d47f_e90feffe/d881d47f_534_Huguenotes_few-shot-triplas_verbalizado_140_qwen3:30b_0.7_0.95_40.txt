Okay, the user wants me to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the provided context and facts about the Huguenots. Let me start by understanding the context thoroughly.

The context mentions that Huguenots were French Protestants during the religious wars in the 16th century. They faced persecution under Louis XIV, leading to their expulsion after the revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685. They were mostly Calvinists and part of the Reformed Church, with some Lutheran communities in Alsace, Moselle, and Montbéliard. There are also facts about their Wikipedia templates, images, and related topics like the French Wars of Religion and their diaspora.

Now, I need to create 10 varied questions. Let me brainstorm possible angles:

1. **Historical Context**: When did the Huguenots face persecution? Answer: Under Louis XIV and after the Edict of Nantes revocation in 1685.
2. **Religious Affiliation**: What were they mainly? Answer: Calvinists and Reformed Church members.
3. **Migration**: Why did they leave France? Answer: Persecution and the revocation of the Edict of Nantes.
4. **Geographical Distribution**: Where were they concentrated in France? Answer: South and central regions.
5. **Key Events**: What event led to their exile? Answer: Revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685.
6. **Cultural Impact**: What is the Huguenot cross? Answer: A symbol of their faith, mentioned in the images.
7. **Historical Figures**: Which city was a Calvinist center? Answer: Geneva.
8. **Related Groups**: What's the connection to Scotch-Irish Americans? Answer: They are related as per the facts.
9. **Historical Conflicts**: What were the French Wars of Religion? Answer: 1562-1598, mentioned in the context.
10. **Symbols and Monuments**: What is the Huguenot obelisk? Answer: A monument, as per the images listed.

Wait, I need to ensure each answer is directly from the context or inferable. Let me check the facts again. The context says they were majoritariamente calvinistas and members of the Reformed Church. The Edict of Nantes was revoked in 1685, leading to expulsion. The French Wars of Religion were from 1562 to 1598. Geneva was the center of Calvinist movement. The Huguenot cross is mentioned in images. The Scotch-Irish Americans are related. The Huguenot obelisk is an image. 

I need to make sure the questions are varied and not repetitive. Let me structure each pair, ensuring the answers are accurate and based on the given data. Avoid any markdown, just the CSV. Also, check for 10 pairs and proper formatting.
