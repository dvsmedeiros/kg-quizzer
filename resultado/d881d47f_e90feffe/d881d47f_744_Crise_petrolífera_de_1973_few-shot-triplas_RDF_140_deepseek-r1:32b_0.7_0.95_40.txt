Okay, I need to create a quiz based on the information provided about the 1973 oil crisis. Let me start by reading through the context and facts carefully to understand all the key points.

The context explains that the oil crisis began in October 1973 when the OPAEP declared an embargo targeting countries supporting Israel during the Yom Kippur War. The affected nations included the US, Canada, Japan, UK, Netherlands, Portugal, Rhodesia, and South Africa. The oil price spiked from $3 to about $12 per barrel by March 1974. This event is referred to as the first oil shock, followed by another in 1979.

Looking at the facts, there are various classifications like economic disasters, embargoes, energy crises, etc., which gives more depth but might not be directly relevant for the quiz questions. The images and other metadata don't seem necessary for generating the questions.

Now, I need to create 10 varied questions covering different aspects of this crisis. Let me list possible angles:

1. When did the crisis start?
2. Which organizations were involved (OPAEP)?
3. Reasons behind the embargo (support for Israel).
4. Targeted countries.
5. Oil price before and after the crisis.
6. Duration of the crisis.
7. Long-term effects on politics/economy.
8. The term used for this event.
9. Follow-up events like the second oil shock in 1979.

Wait, that's only nine points. I need one more. Maybe about the impact on specific countries or sectors, but since the provided context doesn't go into detail, perhaps focusing on the economic changes or policies resulting from the crisis.

Let me structure each question ensuring they are clear and each has a single correct answer based on the given information.

I should avoid repeating similar questions. For example, if I ask about the start date, I shouldn't have another question about timing without adding new info.

Now, let's draft each question:

1. When did the oil crisis of 1973 begin?
2. Who declared the embargo?
3. Why was the embargo imposed?
4. Which countries were initially targeted?
5. How much did the price of oil increase by March 1974?
6. What was this event also called?
7. When was the embargo lifted?
8. What was another name for this crisis?
9. Which subsequent event is known as the second oil shock?
10. How many months did the embargo last?

Wait, checking if all these can be answered with information given. The duration in months isn't directly stated but can be inferred from October 1973 to March 1974, which is about five months.

I think this covers a good range of topics without repetition.
