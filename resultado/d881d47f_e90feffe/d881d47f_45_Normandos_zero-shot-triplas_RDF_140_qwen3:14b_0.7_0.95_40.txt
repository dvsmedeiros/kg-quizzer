Okay, let's see. The user wants me to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the provided context and facts. The context is about the Normans, their origins, and their historical influence. The facts are in a RDF format with various entities and properties.

First, I need to parse the context and the facts to identify key points. The context mentions that the Normans were a Germanic people in northern France, descendants of Vikings, and their significant roles in Europe and the Middle East, including the Norman Conquest of England, Sicily, and involvement in the Crusades.

Looking at the facts, there are a lot of entries with battles, places, people, and other entities linked to the Normans. For example, battles like Battle of Cerami, Battle of Civitate, and others where Normans were combatants. There are also mentions of places like Callan Motte, Dún Dealgan Motte, and others occupied by Normans. People like Alexander of Paris, Richard of Salerno, and families like Hauteville and Lyons are associated with the Normans. There's also information about their languages, religions, and architectural styles.

Now, I need to create varied questions that cover different aspects. The questions should be based on explicit or inferable information from the context and facts. Let me brainstorm possible questions:

1. What is the origin of the term "Normans"?
   - Answer: Derived from Northmen or Norsemen, meaning "men of the North".

2. Which group did the Normans descend from?
   - Answer: Vikings from Scandinavia.

3. What is one of the key historical events associated with the Normans?
   - Answer: The Norman Conquest of England.

4. Which battles are mentioned where the Normans were combatants?
   - Answer: Battles of Cerami, Civitate, Misilmeri, Olivento, etc.

5. What is an example of a place occupied by Normans?
   - Answer: Callan Motte, Dún Dealgan Motte, etc.

6. What languages did the Normans speak?
   - Answer: Latin, Old Norman, and Old Norse.

7. What is a significant contribution of the Normans to architecture?
   - Answer: Motte-and-bailey castles, as seen in the Bayeux Tapestry.

8. Which family is associated with the Normans?
   - Answer: Hauteville family.

9. What religions were practiced by the Normans?
   - Answer: Christianity and Norse paganism.

10. What is an example of a historical figure associated with the Normans?
    - Answer: Richard of Salerno.

Now, I need to ensure that each question is unique and covers different aspects. Let me check for repetition and ensure answers are directly from the context or facts. Also, make sure the answers are accurate based on the provided information.

For example, the answer to the origin of the term "Normans" is in the context. The battles are listed in the facts. The languages are from the ns2:languages in the facts. The religions are mentioned in ns2:religions. The Hauteville family is in the facts under ethnicity. The Bayeux Tapestry image caption mentions motte-and-bailey castles.

I think that's a solid set. Now, format them into CSV with semicolons.
