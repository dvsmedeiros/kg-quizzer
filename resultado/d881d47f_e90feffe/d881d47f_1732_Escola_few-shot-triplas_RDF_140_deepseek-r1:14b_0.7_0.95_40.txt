Okay, so I need to figure out how to create 10 question-answer pairs based on the given RDF data about private schools. The examples provided give me a good idea of what kind of questions and answers to look for.

First, I should understand the structure of the data. Each line like "http://dbpedia.org/resource/St._Andrew's_Episcopal_School_(Maryland)" is linked to the class "Private_school". This means all these resources are private schools.

Now, looking at the examples, the questions often ask for synonyms or related terms. For instance, one question was about another name for private schools besides non-governmental and non-state ones, and the answer was "independentes." So I need to think of similar relationships.

I should consider aspects like funding, names, rights, costs, etc., as these were covered in the examples. Maybe I can ask questions about how private schools are funded, what makes them different from public schools, notable fees, alternative terms for school years, and regional terminology.

Let me brainstorm some potential questions:

1. What other term is used for private schools besides non-governmental and non-state?
2. Besides sports and arts, what kind of scholarships do private schools offer?
3. How are private schools mainly funded if not through taxation?
4. What right do private schools have that public ones don't?
5. What's the annual cost of notable New England boarding schools?
6. What term is used for private schools that don't charge tuition?
7. Which country doesn't typically refer to universities as private schools along with Canada and the UK?
8. Which region uses "private schools" to mean universities?
9. What alternative name is there for the 12th grade in some systems?
10. What's another term for the 13th year of education?

Now, I'll frame these into proper questions and provide answers based on general knowledge:

1. Along with non-governmental and non-state schools, what is another term for private schools? Answer: Independent schools.
2. Besides sports and arts, what kind of scholarships do private institutions offer? Answer: Academic scholarships.
3. How are many private schools primarily funded instead of through taxes? Answer: Through fees or tuition.
4. What right do private schools have that public schools typically don't? Answer: The right to select their students.
5. What is the annual cost for some notable boarding schools in New England? Answer: Approximately $45,000.
6. What are private schools called when they don't charge tuition? Answer: Tuition-free schools or "sem taxa" schools.
7. Which country, along with Canada and the UK, doesn’t usually refer to universities as private schools? Answer: Australia.
8. In which region are universities often referred to as private schools? Answer: North America.
9. What is another term for the 12th grade in some educational systems? Answer: Sixth form or senior year.
10. What alternative name is used for the 13th year of study? Answer: Upper sixth or final year.

I think these cover a range of aspects related to private schools, similar to the examples provided. I just need to make sure each question and answer pair is clear and accurate.
