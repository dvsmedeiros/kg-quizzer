Okay, I need to help the user by generating a quiz based on their provided context about Ctenophora. First, I'll review the context they gave. It's in Portuguese and talks about a genus of large cnidarian sponges, highlighting their diversity, habitat, feeding habits, lifespan, etc.

The user wants me to create 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format. Each pair should have one question related to the context and one correct answer derived from it. They emphasized that I must generate only the data without any extra text or comments.

I need to make sure each question is unique and covers different aspects of the content, like general information, specific species, habitats, feeding methods, lifespan, geographic distribution, size differences, geographic origin, growth rate, and diet details.

Let me list out possible questions. For example, one could ask about an example species, another about habitat variations, feeding habits, lifespan, etc. I'll ensure each answer is directly supported by the context provided.

I also need to structure it as CSV with each question followed by its answer, separated by a semicolon and ending with a newline after each pair. No additional text should be included beyond this data format.

Let me double-check that there are exactly 10 pairs and no duplicates or related questions that I might have missed. Each answer must be clear and based solely on the given context without any extra information.
