Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs based on the provided context and facts. Let me start by reading through the context carefully.

The context talks about prime numbers, their definitions, properties, examples like twin primes, the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic, primorials, and some specific primes. There are also facts listed, like which numbers are primes and some references to Wikipedia templates and images.

First, I need to make sure each question is unique and covers different aspects. Let me brainstorm possible questions.

1. The definition of a prime number: The context says a prime has only two natural divisors, 1 and itself. So a question could be about the number of divisors.

2. Twin primes: The example pairs like (3,5) are mentioned. So a question about what they're called.

3. The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic: The context mentions it states that any number can be uniquely factored into primes.

4. The number of primes below 1000: The context states there are 168.

5. The only even prime: The context says 2 is the only even prime, so a question about that.

6. What's a primorial? The context defines p# as the product of primes up to p.

7. The largest known prime as of 2016: The example mentions 22,338,618 digits, but the context doesn't specify, so maybe use the example given.

Wait, the examples include "Em janeiro de 2016, de quantos dígitos consiste o maior número primo conhecido?;22.338.618 dígitos decimais." So maybe that's a valid question, but I need to check if it's in the context. The context's facts mention 2,147,483,647 as a prime, but not the 2016 record. However, the examples include that question, so maybe it's acceptable.

But I need to make sure the answers are from the context or facts. Let me check the facts. The facts list numbers with prime factorization, like 103, 47, etc. But the examples given in the user's message include questions about the largest prime, which might not be in the context. However, the user's example includes that, so maybe it's okay to use it as a question, even if the context doesn't mention it, as long as it's a general knowledge question.

But the instructions say to use the context and facts. So maybe avoid that. Let me think again.

Looking back at the context, the facts mention "2,147,483,647 possui fatoração Prime number" which is a known prime (Mersenne prime). But the context doesn't mention the largest known prime. So perhaps avoid that question.

Another point: the context mentions that 15877# – 1 is the largest prime of the form p# – 1. So a question about that.

Also, the context lists primes like 103, 47, etc. So maybe a question about which numbers are primes. But the facts list many numbers with "possui fatoração Prime number", so maybe a question like "Which of these numbers is a prime? 103, 47, 100" but the answer would be 103 and 47. But the user's examples have questions with specific answers.

Alternatively, the context mentions that the only even prime is 2, so a question about that.

Another point: the context says that the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic is the one that defines the role of primes. So a question about that.

Another fact: the context says that primes can be represented as a product of primes, so a question about that.

Also, the context mentions that 1 is excluded to preserve uniqueness in the theorem. So a question about why 1 is excluded.

But the user's example already has a question about that. So need to make sure not to repeat.

So possible questions:

1. How many natural divisors does a prime number have? Answer: Two (1 and itself).

2. What are primes like (3,5) called? Answer: Twin primes.

3. What theorem states that every integer can be uniquely factored into primes? Answer: The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic.

4. How many prime numbers are there below 1000? Answer: 168.

5. What is the only even prime number? Answer: 2.

6. What is the term for the product of all primes up to a certain prime p? Answer: Primorial (p#).

7. Why is 1 excluded from being a prime? Answer: To maintain the uniqueness of prime factorization.

8. What is the name of the process to verify if a number is prime? Answer: Primality testing.

9. Which prime is known as 2^31 - 1? Answer: 2,147,483,647.

10. What is the largest prime of the form p# - 1? Answer: 15877# – 1.

Now, I need to check if these answers are present in the context or facts. For example:

- The context says "O teorema fundamental da aritmética" is the one mentioned.

- The number of primes below 1000 is 168.

- The only even prime is 2.

- Primorial is defined as p#.

- The reason 1 is excluded is mentioned in the examples.

- The process is called primality testing, though the context might not use that exact term, but it's a general term.

- 2,147,483,647 is listed in the facts as a prime.

- The largest p# -1 is 15877# – 1.

So these should be valid. Now, I need to phrase the questions clearly and ensure the answers are accurate.
