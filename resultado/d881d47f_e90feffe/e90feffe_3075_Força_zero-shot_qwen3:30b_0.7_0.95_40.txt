Okay, the user wants me to generate 10 pairs of questions and answers in CSV format based on the context "Força" (which means "Force" in Portuguese). Let me start by understanding the requirements.

First, I need to make sure each question is relevant to the context of "Força" and that the answers are either explicit or inferable from the content. Since the context is just the word "Força," I need to think about different aspects related to force in physics. 

Possible topics could include Newton's laws, types of forces, units of measurement, examples of forces, and maybe the concept of force in different contexts. I should vary the questions to cover these aspects without repeating similar ones.

Let me brainstorm some questions. For example, "O que é força em física?" (What is force in physics?) The answer would be a definition. Then, "Qual a unidade de medida da força no Sistema Internacional?" (What is the unit of measurement for force in the International System?) The answer is Newton (N).

Next, I need to cover different types of forces, like gravitational, frictional, electromagnetic, etc. Questions like "Quais são os tipos de forças mencionados no contexto?" (What are the types of forces mentioned in the context?) But since the context is just "Força," maybe I should infer common types. Wait, the user said to use the provided context, which is only the word "Força." So I need to make sure the answers are based on that. But if the context is minimal, maybe the answers have to be general knowledge. However, the user mentioned "based on context and facts provided," so if the context is only "Força," the answers should be derived from that. But that's very limited. Maybe the user expects general knowledge about force, assuming the context is about physics. 

Alternatively, maybe the context is a text provided earlier, but in this case, the user only provided "Força" as the context. So I have to work with that. But that's tricky. Without more information, I need to create questions that are standard in physics. 

Another angle: Newton's laws. Questions like "Qual a primeira lei de Newton também conhecida como?" (Which is Newton's first law also known as?) The answer is the law of inertia. 

Also, maybe the formula for force, F=ma. So a question like "Qual a fórmula que relaciona força, massa e aceleração?" (What is the formula that relates force, mass, and acceleration?) Answer: F = m * a.

I need to ensure 10 unique questions. Let me list possible ones:

1. Definição de força.
2. Unidade de força no SI.
3. Tipos de forças (gravitacional, eletromagnética, etc.).
4. Leis de Newton.
5. Exemplos de forças.
6. Força como vetor.
7. Força resultante.
8. Força de atrito.
9. Força gravitacional.
10. Unidade de força em outros sistemas (como newton vs. dina).

Wait, but the context is only "Força," so maybe the answers should be based on that. However, without more context, I have to rely on general knowledge. The user might have intended that the context is a text about force, but in this case, it's just the word. Maybe the user made a mistake, but I have to proceed.

I'll proceed with standard physics questions about force, assuming the context is about physics. Now, I need to make sure each question is unique and covers different aspects. Let me check for repetition. For example, not asking about units and then another about the same. 

Now, structure the CSV. Each line is "pergunta;resposta". Make sure no markdown, just plain text. Also, check that answers are correct. For example, the unit is Newton, types include gravitational, electromagnetic, etc. 

I think that's covered. Now, compile the 10 pairs.
