Okay, the user wants me to generate 10 CSV question-answer pairs based on the context provided, which is about Harvard University. Let me start by recalling the key information about Harvard that's commonly known. 

First, I need to make sure the questions are varied and cover different aspects. Let me list some important facts: founding year, notable alumni, famous buildings, academic programs, notable figures, historical events, rankings, campus size, libraries, and maybe some unique traditions.

Wait, the user mentioned not to repeat similar questions. So I should avoid overlapping topics. For example, if I ask about the founding year, I shouldn't have another question about its establishment. Let me check each point.

1. Founded in 1636, but the university as it exists today was established in 1782. Wait, the actual founding date is 1636, but the Harvard College was established then. The university as a whole might have a different date. I need to confirm that. Oh right, Harvard was founded in 1636 as a college, and the university status came later. So the correct answer for founding year is 1636.

2. Notable alumni: figures like Barack Obama, Bill Gates, etc. But I should pick specific names. Maybe mention a few.

3. Landmark buildings: Widener Library, Harvard Yard, the Harvard Business School building. Also, the Harvard Medical School.

4. Academic programs: Ivy League, undergraduate and graduate programs, specific schools like Law, Business, Medicine.

5. Notable figures: John F. Kennedy, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, etc.

6. Historical events: Maybe the Great Fire of 1767, which destroyed part of the campus.

7. Rankings: Often ranked first in the US.

8. Campus size: Over 2000 acres, including the Cambridge campus.

9. Libraries: The Harvard University Library system is the largest in the US.

10. Traditions: The Harvard Crimson color, the Harvard-Yale game, maybe the "Hasty Pudding".

Now, I need to phrase each question clearly, ensuring each has a unique answer. Let me make sure the answers are directly from the context and avoid any ambiguity. Also, check that each question is distinct and covers different areas. Once I have 10, I'll format them into CSV as specified.
