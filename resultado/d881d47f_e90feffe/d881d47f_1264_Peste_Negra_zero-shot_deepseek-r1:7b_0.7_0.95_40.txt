Okay, I need to create a quiz with 10 question pairs based on the context about the Black Death and its impact in Europe during the 14th century. The user wants each pair to be in CSV format with questions and answers separated by semicolons, all in Portuguese.

First, I'll think of various aspects related to the Black Death—such as causes, effects, consequences, notable events, and figures associated. Since there are four main parts of the Black Death (fallout, bubonic, septicemic, pneumonic), each can be a question on one part. Then, I can include other elements like causes, what happened in different regions, notable dates, and health measures taken.

I should ensure that each question is unique and covers different aspects to provide a comprehensive quiz. The answers need to be accurate historical facts based on the context provided.

Let me list out possible questions:

1. When did the Black Death end? (Answer: 1352)
2. Which part of the Black Death was first identified in 1347? (Bubonic)
3. What caused the Black Death's spread initially? (Fecal传播)
4. Where was the third pandemic? (Iberia and the Iberian Peninsula)
5. What was the second most deadly wave called? (Pneumatica)
6. Which region had severe economic impacts? (O Oriente do Euı́deo)
7. Which figure opposed Black Death practices? (Aristóteles)
8. When did Peccot's work get published? (1592)
9. Which disease led to the deaths of 50,000 Florentines? (Fenestraria)
10. What health measure reduced death rates by over 70%? (Hygiene measures)

I think these cover a good range and each has a clear answer from the context provided.
