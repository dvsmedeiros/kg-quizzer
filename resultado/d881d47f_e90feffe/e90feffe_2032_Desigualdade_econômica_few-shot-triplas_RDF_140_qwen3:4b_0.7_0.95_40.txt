Okay, the user wants me to generate 10 pairs of questions and answers in CSV format based on the provided context about economic inequality. Let me start by understanding the context thoroughly.

The context mentions that economic inequality includes distribution of income and wealth, measures like Gini coefficient and Human Development Index adjusted for inequality, and factors like globalization affecting inequality between countries and within them. Also, there are various studies and examples related to this topic.

Looking at the examples given, they cover different aspects: percentages of global assets, comparisons between the richest and the poor, methods of measuring inequality, effects of globalization, and specific data from organizations like Oxfam and Credit Suisse. The key is to ensure that the questions are varied and cover different aspects without repetition.

I need to create 10 unique questions. Let me brainstorm possible angles:

1. What is the most commonly used measure for economic inequality?
2. What is the concept that refers to equal opportunities in economic terms?
3. What is the term for the distribution of wealth versus income in economic inequality?
4. How does globalization affect economic inequality globally and within countries?
5. What are two examples of measures used to assess economic inequality?
6. What does the Gini coefficient indicate?
7. What is the main focus of the Human Development Index adjusted for inequality?
8. What is the term for the idea that greater inequality hinders long-term growth?
9. What is the term for the concept that everyone should have the same opportunities regardless of their starting point?
10. What is the term for the idea that outcomes should be equal regardless of individual circumstances?

Now, I need to check if these questions are based on the provided facts and if the answers are correct. The context mentions the Gini coefficient as the most used measure, the Human Development Index adjusted for inequality, the difference between wealth and income distribution, globalization's effects, and concepts like equity, equality of opportunity, and equity.

I should make sure the answers are accurate and directly derived from the text. Also, the questions should be in Portuguese and follow the exact format specified, with each pair separated by a semicolon and the CSV structure.

Let me verify each question against the context again. For example, the Gini coefficient is mentioned as the most used measure, so that's correct. The Human Development Index adjusted for inequality is also mentioned. The concepts of equity and equality of opportunity are part of the important concepts. The effects of globalization are covered in the context.

I think these 10 questions cover different aspects: measures, concepts, effects, and related terms. They are all based on the provided information and are unique. Now, I'll format them into the CSV as required.
