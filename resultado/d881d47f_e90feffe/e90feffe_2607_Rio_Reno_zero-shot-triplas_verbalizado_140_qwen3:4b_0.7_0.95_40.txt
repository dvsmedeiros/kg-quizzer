Okay, I need to generate 10 pairs of questions and answers based on the provided context and facts about the Rhine River. Let me start by understanding the key points from the context and the list of facts.

The Rhine is a major river in Europe, 1233 km long, flowing from south to north, ending in the North Sea. The facts mention various locations, bridges, power plants, and other rivers related to the Rhine. There are mentions of places where the Rhine has its source or mouth, like Schwarzbach (Bergisches Land) having the mouth of the Rhine, Emscher draining into the Rhine, and several bridges crossing the Rhine. Also, there are references to different names in various languages (German, French, etc.), and some images associated with the Rhine.

I need to make sure the questions are varied and cover different aspects. Let me think of different aspects: geography (length, direction, mouth), related rivers and their connections, bridges, power plants, names in different languages, locations of source and mouth, and maybe some specific facts about the Rhine's characteristics.

First, I'll list possible questions:

1. What is the length of the Rhine River?
2. In which direction does the Rhine River flow?
3. Where does the Rhine River empty into?
4. Which river has its mouth located in the Rhine?
5. Which bridge crosses the Rhine in Bonn?
6. What is the name of the Rhine in French?
7. Which power plant uses the Rhine for cooling?
8. What is the name of the Rhine in German?
9. Which river has its source located in the Rhine?
10. What is the name of the Rhine in Dutch?

Now I need to check if these are covered in the provided facts. For example, the length is given as 1233 km. The direction is from south to north. The mouth is in the North Sea. The Schwarzbach (Bergisches Land) has the mouth of the Rhine. The Emscher drains into the Rhine. The Deutz Suspension Bridge crosses the Rhine. The name in French is "Rhin". The power plant is the Biblis Nuclear Power Plant, which uses the Rhine for cooling. The name in German is "Rhein". The river with source in the Rhine is Elbling. The name in Dutch is "Rijn".

I need to make sure each question is based on the facts. Also, avoid repetition. Let me check each point again. The first question is about length, which is correct. Second about direction, correct. Third about the mouth, correct. Fourth, the river with mouth in Rhine is Schwarzbach (Bergisches Land). Fifth, the Deutz Suspension Bridge in Bonn. Sixth, the French name is Rhin. Seventh, the power plant is Biblis. Eighth, the German name is Rhein. Ninth, Elbling has its source in the Rhine. Tenth, the Dutch name is Rijn.

Yes, these are all covered in the facts. Now I need to present them in the CSV format as per the instructions. Each pair should be in the format "question;answer" without any markdown. Let me make sure there are exactly 10 pairs and that each is unique and covers different aspects.
