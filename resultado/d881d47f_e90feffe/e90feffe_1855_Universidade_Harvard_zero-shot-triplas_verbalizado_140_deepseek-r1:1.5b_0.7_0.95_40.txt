Okay, let's see what the user is asking for. They want me to create a CSV with ten pairs of questions and answers based on the provided context and facts. 

First, I need to understand the structure of each question. Each question should be unique and relate to different aspects of Harvard University. It should also have an explicit or inferred answer that can be found in the given information.

For each topic, I'll create a question that's clear and directly related to Harvard University. The response should be straightforward, either explaining something or providing information from the facts given. 

I have to ensure that each pair is separated by semicolon (;) as specified in the CSV format. Also, only the correct answer should be included without any explanations.

Let me make a list of potential questions and their corresponding answers:
