Okay, the user wants me to generate 10 objective questions and answers in CSV format based on the provided context and facts. Let me start by understanding the context.

The context is about computational complexity theory in computer science and mathematics. It mentions that this theory classifies computational problems based on resource usage and explores relationships between these classifications. A computational problem is a task solvable by a computer using mechanical mathematical steps, like an algorithm.

The facts given include various scholars associated with computational complexity theory, some of their academic disciplines, and properties of the theory. The examples provided in the user's message include questions about the main focus of the theory, how problems are classified, definitions of computational problems, and related fields.

I need to create 10 unique questions that cover different aspects of the context. Let me list possible topics: classification criteria, key concepts like computational problems, resources used (time, space), related fields, scholars involved, and maybe some specific terms or models.

Looking at the examples, they covered the main subject, classification based on difficulty, definition of computational problems, resources (time and space), models of computation, related fields, and scholars. I should ensure that my questions are varied and not repeating the same topics as the examples.

First, I can ask about the main focus of computational complexity theory. Then, the two main resources used. Next, the definition of a computational problem. Then, the two related fields. Maybe the role of scholars in this field. Also, the purpose of studying complexity theory. Perhaps the difference between computational problems and other problem types. Also, the main goal of the theory. Maybe the classification of problems based on their intrinsic difficulty.

Wait, the user's example already includes questions about the main focus, resources, related fields, and the role of scholars. I need to make sure my questions are different. Let me check the facts again. The facts mention scholars like Christos Papadimitriou, David Shmoys, etc., so maybe a question about who is associated with the theory.

But the user's instructions say to base the questions on the context provided, not on the scholars. The context is about the theory itself, so maybe questions about the classification criteria, the resources, the purpose, the main goal, and related concepts.

Let me think of 10 distinct questions:

1. What is the primary focus of computational complexity theory?
2. Which two resources are primarily used to measure computational complexity?
3. What is the definition of a computational problem?
4. What is the main goal of studying computational complexity theory?
5. What are two fields in theoretical computer science that are closely related to complexity theory?
6. What is the role of scholars in computational complexity theory?
7. What is the purpose of classifying computational problems based on their intrinsic difficulty?
8. What is the main difference between a computational problem and a non-computational problem?
9. What is the significance of the P vs NP problem in complexity theory?
10. What is the main challenge in determining the computational complexity of a problem?

Wait, the user's example already has a question about the P vs NP problem? No, the examples don't mention that. Let me check the examples again. The examples include questions about the main focus, classification, computational problems, resources, models, related fields, and scholars. So I need to avoid repeating those. The example questions are:

- What is the main focus of computational complexity theory?
- What is the primary attribute for classifying computational problems?
- What is a computational problem?
- What measures the difficulty of a problem?
- What method is used to evaluate resources?
- What are the two main resources?
- What unit measures circuit complexity?
- What is the practical role of complexity?
- What two fields reflect complexity theory?
- What field analyzes algorithmic resource requirements?

So I need to create 10 new ones. Let me think of other aspects. Maybe the classification into complexity classes, the importance of models of computation, the role of algorithms, the relationship between complexity and computability, etc.

Alternatively, the user's context says that computational problems are tasks solvable by a computer via mechanical steps. So maybe a question about the definition of a computational problem, but that's already in the examples. Hmm.

Alternatively, the importance of computational complexity in determining what is computationally feasible. Or the role of complexity theory in algorithm design.

Wait, the user's examples include questions about the two main resources (time and space), the purpose of complexity theory (determine practical limits), and related fields (algorithm analysis and computability theory).

So I need to come up with 10 unique questions. Let me try:

1. What is the primary objective of computational complexity theory?
2. Which two factors are used to measure the complexity of a computational problem?
3. What is the main difference between a computational problem and a non-computational problem?
4. What is the significance of the P vs NP problem in computational complexity?
5. What is the role of models of computation in complexity theory?
6. What is the primary challenge in determining the computational complexity of a problem?
7. What is the main contribution of scholars in the field of computational complexity?
8. How does computational complexity theory help in understanding the feasibility of algorithms?
9. What is the main focus of algorithmic analysis in the context of complexity theory?
10. What is the primary goal of studying computational complexity in theoretical computer science?

Wait, some of these might be overlapping with the examples. Let me check again. The examples include questions about the main focus, resources, related fields, and scholars. So I need to ensure that the questions are different.

Alternatively, maybe the role of computational complexity in determining the practicality of solving problems, the relationship between complexity and algorithm efficiency, the importance of classification into complexity classes, etc.

Another approach: the context mentions that computational complexity is about classifying problems based on difficulty and relationship. So maybe questions about the classification criteria, the types of problems in different complexity classes, the implications of complexity classes, etc.

But the user's examples already have questions about classification based on difficulty, the two main resources, and related fields. So perhaps I can ask about the different complexity classes (like P, NP, etc.), the difference between time and space complexity, the role of the P vs NP problem, the importance of polynomial time, etc.

Let me try to create 10 unique questions now, ensuring they're not repeated from the examples.

1. What is the main purpose of studying computational complexity theory?
2. What are the two primary resources used to measure the complexity of a computational problem?
3. What is the primary difference between a computational problem and a non-computational problem?
4. What is the significance of the P vs NP problem in the field of computational complexity?
5. How does computational complexity theory help in determining the feasibility of solving problems?
6. What is the role of models of computation in the study of computational complexity?
7. What is the main focus of algorithmic analysis in the context of complexity theory?
8. What is the primary challenge in determining the computational complexity of a problem?
9. How does computational complexity theory contribute to the understanding of algorithm efficiency?
10. What is the main contribution of scholars in the field of computational complexity theory?

I think these are all distinct and cover various aspects of the theory. Now, I need to make sure the answers are based on the context provided. The context states that computational complexity theory classifies problems by difficulty and relationship, uses time and space, defines computational problems as solvable by a computer, etc.

So for the first question, the answer would be to classify problems by difficulty and their relationships. The second question is time and space. Third, computational problems are those solvable by a computer. Fourth, the P vs NP problem is about whether all problems that can be solved efficiently (P) are also solvable in polynomial time (NP). Fifth, complexity theory helps determine what's feasible. Sixth, models of computation are used to define problem-solving methods. Seventh, algorithmic analysis studies resource requirements. Eighth, the challenge is determining the exact complexity measures. Ninth, complexity theory helps understand how efficient algorithms are. Tenth, scholars contribute by developing theories and techniques.

Now, I need to check if these answers are accurate based on the context. The context mentions that computational problems are tasks solvable by a computer, and that complexity theory classifies them by difficulty and relationship. The P vs NP problem is a key question in complexity theory, though the context doesn't mention it explicitly. However, the examples include a question about the P vs NP problem, so maybe the user expects that. Wait, in the examples given by the user, the last example is about the fields related to complexity theory. So maybe the P vs NP is a known concept in the field, even if not explicitly stated in the context. The user's context does mention that the theory explores relationships between classifications, which includes the P vs NP problem.

So the answers should align with that. Therefore, the 10 questions and answers should be based on the context, even if some concepts are well-known in the field. The key is to ensure that the questions are derived from the provided context and facts.
