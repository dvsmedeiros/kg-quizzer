Okay, the user wants me to generate 10 pairs of questions and answers in CSV format based on the provided context and facts about the 1973 oil crisis. Let me start by understanding the context thoroughly.

The context mentions that the 1973 oil crisis began in October 1973 when OPEC (specifically the Arab members, referred to as OPAEP in the context) imposed an oil embargo. The targets were countries supporting Israel during the Yom Kippur War, including Canada, Japan, the Netherlands, the UK, and the US. Later, Portugal, Rhodesia, and South Africa were also affected. The oil price increased from $3 to $12 per barrel, causing a global economic crisis known as the first oil shock, followed by the 1979 crisis as the second.

Now, the facts provided are in RDF format, which might include some technical terms, but the user wants the questions and answers in Portuguese, based on the context. The key points to cover are the start of the crisis, the embargo reasons, the countries affected, the price increase, the term "first oil shock," the subsequent 1979 crisis, and the economic impacts.

I need to ensure that each question is unique and covers different aspects. Let me brainstorm possible questions:

1. When did the 1973 oil crisis begin? (Answer: October 1973)
2. Which organization imposed the embargo? (Answer: OPAEP/OPEC)
3. Why was the embargo imposed? (Answer: Countries supporting Israel during Yom Kippur War)
4. Which countries were initially targeted? (Answer: Canada, Japan, Netherlands, UK, US)
5. Which countries were later added? (Answer: Portugal, Rhodesia, South Africa)
6. How much did the oil price increase? (Answer: From $3 to $12 per barrel)
7. What was the crisis called? (Answer: First oil shock)
8. What was the subsequent crisis called? (Answer: Second oil shock in 1979)
9. What was the impact of the embargo? (Answer: Global economic crisis, price increases)
10. What is the term for the price increase? (Answer: Oil price surge or increase)

Wait, I need to check if all these are covered in the context. The context mentions the embargo was directed at countries supporting Israel during the Yom Kippur War. The initial targets are listed, then later additions. The price increase is from $3 to $12. The first and second shocks are mentioned. The effects include a crisis with short and long-term impacts on politics and economy.

I need to make sure each question is distinct and not overlapping. For example, one question about the start date, another about the reason, another about the countries, another about the price, another about the names of the shocks, and maybe one about the consequences.

Let me structure them:

1. Data de início da crise petrolífera de 1973?
2. Qual organização impôs o embargo?
3. Por que o embargo foi imposto?
4. Quais países foram inicialmente alvo?
5. Quais países foram adicionados posteriormente?
6. Qual foi o aumento no preço do petróleo?
7. Como foi chamada a crise de 1973?
8. Qual foi a crise subsequente?
9. Quais foram os efeitos do embargo?
10. Como se chamou o aumento nos preços?

Now, check if the answers are in the context. The context says the embargo was by OPAEP (Arab members of OPEC). The initial targets are listed. The price increase is mentioned. The first and second shocks are noted. The effects include a global crisis.

Now, translate the answers correctly. For example, "OPAEP" is the Portuguese name for OPEC, so the answer should be "Organização dos Países Árabes Exportadores de Petróleo (OPAEP)" but the context uses "OPAEP" in the first sentence. The user might prefer the acronym. Also, the answer should be concise.

Check for repetition. Each question should be different. Avoid similar questions. Ensure that each answer is directly from the context.

Now, format as CSV, with semicolons. No markdown, just the CSV lines.
