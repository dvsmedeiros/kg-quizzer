Okay, I need to generate 10 pairs of questions and answers in CSV format based on the provided context and facts about the Normans. Let me start by understanding the context and the key points given.

The Normans were a Germanic people in northern France, with a mix of Viking heritage. They had a significant role in medieval Europe, including the Norman Conquest of England, states in Sicily, and the Crusades. They spoke Old Norse and Old Norman, followed Norse paganism and later Christianity, and had various cultural and architectural influences like Norman architecture.

Looking at the facts, there are multiple points about their religion, languages, related groups, historical events, and locations. The examples given in the prompt show that questions can be about origins, religion, languages, historical events, related groups, and more.

I need to make sure each question is unique and covers different aspects. Let me list possible topics:

1. Origin of the term "Norman"
2. Religion they followed
3. Languages they spoke
4. Related ethnic groups
5. Historical events involving Normans
6. Architectural styles associated with them
7. Nationality of certain historical figures
8. Places associated with Normans
9. Hierarchy or leadership
10. Cultural or historical significance

Now, I need to check the facts to ensure the answers are accurate. For example, the term "Norman" comes from "Northmen," so that's a good question. Their religion was Norse paganism initially, then Christianity. They spoke Old Norse and Old Norman. Related groups include Jersey people, Gallo-Romans, Franks, etc. Historical events like the Battle of Hastings, Battle of Civitate, etc. Architectural styles like Norman architecture in churches. Nationality of figures like Richard of Salerno. Places like Taunton Castle, Kells Castle, etc.

I should make sure each question is distinct and based on the facts. Let me start drafting the questions and answers, ensuring they are in Portuguese and follow the CSV format with the correct separator.
