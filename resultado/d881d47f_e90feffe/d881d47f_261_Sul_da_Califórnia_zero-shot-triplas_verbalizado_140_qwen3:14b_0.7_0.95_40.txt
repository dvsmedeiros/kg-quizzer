Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the provided context and facts. The context is about Southern California, and there are a bunch of facts listed. I need to make sure each question is unique and covers different aspects.

First, I'll look through the context. It mentions Southern California is the informal name for a part of California, its population in 2019 was 23.8 million, and its geographical boundaries. The facts include various organizations, places, people, and other details.

I need to create varied questions. Let's start with the population. A question about the population in 2019 is straightforward. Then, maybe the geographical boundaries. The context says the western boundary is the Pacific Ocean, southern is the border with Mexico, and eastern is Arizona. That's a good question.

Next, looking at the facts, there are several organizations and companies that operate in Southern California. May Company California, Fedco, Automobile Club of Southern California, etc. So a question about which organizations are based there.

Also, there are notable people born there, like Stephen Kosslyn, Diane Anderson-Minshall, etc. So a question about people born in Southern California.

Subdivisions are mentioned, like Kern County, San Diego County, Riverside County. So a question about subdivisions.

Imagery and maps: the context mentions images like I-8 (CA).svg, Sunset pier.jpg, and the map Southern California counties in red noshade.png. So a question about the map image.

There's also information about earthquakes affecting Southern California, like the 1994 Northridge earthquake. So a question about that.

Other facts include languages spoken there, like Tongva and Tataviam. Maybe a question about languages.

Models used on Wikipedia pages, like Template:Portal, Template:California. So a question about the Wikipedia templates.

Also, the total area is mentioned as 56,505 square miles. That's another possible question.

Wait, but the user said to generate exactly 10 pairs. Let me check the facts again to ensure I cover different aspects without repetition. I need to make sure each question is based on the provided data and answers are directly from the facts.

Okay, compiling the list:

1. Population in 2019
2. Geographical boundaries
3. Organizations operating there (May Company, Fedco, Automobile Club)
4. Notable people born there (Stephen Kosslyn, Diane Anderson-Minshall)
5. Subdivisions (Kern County, San Diego County)
6. Map image (Southern California counties in red noshade.png)
7. Earthquakes (1994 Northridge)
8. Languages (Tongva)
9. Wikipedia templates (Template:California)
10. Total area (56,505 mi²)

That should cover 10 different aspects. Now, formulating the questions and answers correctly in Portuguese, ensuring the answers are exact from the facts provided.
