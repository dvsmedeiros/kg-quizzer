Okay, let's see. The user wants me to generate 10 objective questions in CSV format about the University of Chicago based on the provided context. The context is just "Universidade_de_Chicago", which is the Portuguese name for the University of Chicago. Since there's no additional content given, I need to rely on general knowledge about the university to create relevant questions and answers.

First, I need to make sure that all questions are in Portuguese and the answers are correct. The user specified that the questions should cover different aspects of the university. So, I should think about different areas like location, founding year, notable alumni, academic programs, campus features, etc.

Let me start by recalling basic facts. The University of Chicago is located in Chicago, Illinois. It was founded in 1890. It's known for its strong economics program, the Chicago Economics Department. The campus is in Hyde Park. Famous alumni include Barack Obama, who was a student there. The university is also known for its research and has several Nobel laureates associated with it.

Now, considering these points, I can form questions. Let's list possible questions:

1. Where is the University of Chicago located?
2. When was the University of Chicago founded?
3. Which former U.S. President studied at the University of Chicago?
4. What academic program is the university particularly known for?
5. What is the name of the university's campus?
6. How many Nobel laureates are affiliated with the university?
7. What is the name of the university's economics department?
8. What is the student population size?
9. What is the university's mascot?
10. What is the university's ranking in the 2023 U.S. News & World Report?

Wait, some of these might need specific data. For example, the number of Nobel laureates is a specific number. Let me verify: The University of Chicago has over 100 Nobel laureates. Also, the economics department is part of the Harris School of Public Policy? Or maybe the Booth School of Business? Wait, the economics department itself is part of the university's social sciences division. The name "Chicago Economics Department" is a common reference.

The campus is Hyde Park. The mascot is the Maroon. The student population is around 15,000 undergraduates and 12,000 graduates, but I need to check. Wait, the total is about 15,000 undergraduate and 12,000 graduate students. So maybe the total is around 27,000. But the question could be phrased as the approximate number. For the 2023 ranking, the university is typically in the top 10 in the U.S. News rankings, maybe #6 or #7.

I need to ensure that all answers are accurate. Let me structure the questions and answers accordingly, making sure each is unique and covers different aspects. Avoid repeating the same topic. For example, if I ask about location and campus, they're related but different enough. Similarly, Nobel laureates and economics department are separate topics.

Now, translating these into Portuguese and formatting them correctly with semicolons. Let's proceed step by step.
