Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the given context and facts. The context is about computational complexity theory, and the facts list various people, models, categories, and other details related to it.

First, I need to ensure that the questions are varied and cover different aspects. Let me go through the facts again. There are names of people associated with the theory, like Nikolai Bakhvalov, Jelani Nelson, Ryan Williams, etc. Then there are models used, such as Template:Computer science, Template:Quote, and others. There's also information about categories, types, images, and dates.

So, possible question topics could be: who is associated with the theory, what models are used, what categories it belongs to, images related to it, and the date mentioned. I need to make sure each question is unique and doesn't repeat the same type. For example, one question could be about a person, another about a model, another about a category, and so on.

I should check that each answer is directly from the facts provided. For example, if the fact says "Computational complexity theory possui imagem representativa Complexity subsets pspace.svg," then a question could be about the representative image. Similarly, for the date, the fact mentions "Computational complexity theory possui data January 2022," so a question about the date would be valid.

I also need to avoid making up answers. Only use the information given. Let me list out possible pairs:

1. Who is known for Computational complexity theory? Answer: Nikolai Sergeevich Bakhvalov
2. What is a model used by Computational complexity theory? Answer: Template:Computer science
3. What category is Computational complexity theory part of? Answer: Category:Computational fields of study
4. What is the representative image of Computational complexity theory? Answer: Complexity subsets pspace.svg
5. Which person is associated with Computational complexity theory? Answer: Jelani Nelson
6. What is the main topic of Computational complexity theory? Answer: Computational complexity theory
7. What is the date associated with Computational complexity theory? Answer: January 2022
8. What model is used by Computational complexity theory? Answer: Template:ComplexityClasses
9. What is another category of Computational complexity theory? Answer: Category:Computational complexity theory
10. What image is associated with Computational complexity theory? Answer: Turing machine 2b.svg

Wait, I need to make sure each answer is unique and not repeating the same fact. Let me check again. The date is January 2022. The models include several templates. The categories are two different ones. The images are different. People are different. That should work. Now, format them into CSV as specified, using semicolons and Portuguese.
