Okay, I need to create exactly 10 pairs of questions and answers based on the provided context and facts. Let me start by understanding each fact given.

First, the company is British Satellite Broadcasting (BSB), formed in 1986. Their films include "Galaxy," which is a documentary about the history of the company. That makes sense as a question and answer pair.

Next, there are several films listed with their respective companies: "Heil_Honey_I'm_Home!", "Memphis_Belle!", "Now!", "The_Computer_Channel_(BSB)", "The_Movie_Channel_(British_TV_channel)", and "The_Power_Station_(TV_channel)". Each of these films is associated with a specific company, so I can create questions about each film's origin.

The website provides information on the primary topic of BSB, which includes company, production, studio, etc. So, another pair focusing on this information.

I also notice that there are several TV channels linked to BSB: "The_Computer_Channel_(BSB)", "The_Movie_Channel_(British_TV_channel)", and "The_Power_Station_(TV_channel)". These can be questions about their respective content.

Looking at the facts, some films have their own companies involved. For example, "Heil_Honey_I'm_Home!" is produced by H.) So a pair here would compare this film with its company.

Additionally, there are two films that don't specify an owner or company: "Memphis_Belle!" and "The_Power_Station_(TV_channel)". This can be expanded into multiple pairs since they might have different owners or companies.

Putting it all together, I'll structure 10 questions covering the company formation, film details, website info, TV channels, and films without owners. Each will have a clear answer based on the provided facts.
