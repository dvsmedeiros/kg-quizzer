Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs based on the provided context and facts. Let me start by reading through the context and facts carefully.

First, the context talks about Victoria, Australia. It mentions that Victoria is the smallest state in Australia but the second most populous. Melbourne is the capital and a major city. The history includes colonization, the gold rush, and its role as a federal capital before Canberra. There's info on governance, economy, culture, and notable places like the Melbourne Cricket Ground and the Australian Open.

Now, looking at the facts, there are a lot of people and places associated with Victoria. For example, John Siddons, Daniel Andrews, Southern Melbourne Saints, Great Victorian Bike Ride, etc. Also, there's information about schools, events, and other institutions located in Victoria.

I need to create questions that are varied and cover different aspects. Let me brainstorm possible questions:

1. What is the capital of Victoria, Australia?
   - Answer: Melbourne

2. Which event was held at the Melbourne Cricket Ground in 1956?
   - Answer: The 1956 Summer Olympics

3. What is the name of Victoria's current governor?
   - Answer: Linda Dessau

4. Which political party has been governing Victoria since 2014?
   - Answer: The Labor Party (Partido Trabalhista)

5. What is the population density of Victoria, Australia?
   - Answer: 28 per km²

6. Which river is named after a subdivision in Victoria?
   - Answer: Cann River

7. Which university in Victoria was established in 1853?
   - Answer: The University of Melbourne

8. Who is the current Premier of Victoria?
   - Answer: Daniel Andrews

9. What is the name of the state library in Victoria?
   - Answer: State Library Victoria

10. Which event is held annually at the Melbourne Park?
    - Answer: The Australian Open

Now, I need to check if these answers are correct based on the context and facts. Let's verify each one:

1. Capital is Melbourne – correct from context.
2. 1956 Olympics at MCG – correct.
3. Governor Linda Dessau – correct.
4. Labor Party since 2014 – correct.
5. Population density 28 – from the facts.
6. Cann River as subdivision – correct.
7. University of Melbourne 1853 – correct.
8. Daniel Andrews as Premier – correct.
9. State Library Victoria – correct.
10. Australian Open at Melbourne Park – correct.

I should ensure that the questions are not repeating and cover different areas: geography, history, politics, economy, culture, institutions, and specific events. Also, check that answers are directly from the text. Looks good. Now format them as CSV with semicolons.
