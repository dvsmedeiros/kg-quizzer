Okay, so I need to create a CSV file with 10 pairs of questions and correct answers based on the provided context about the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Let me think through how to approach this.

First, I should understand the structure. Each line in the CSV will be "pergunta;resposta". The topics need to cover various aspects of the IPCC, such as its main objectives, key findings, reports, impacts, mitigation efforts, and related organizations.

I'll start by listing possible questions. Maybe include what the IPCC is best known for, which countries are part of it, what the Fourth Assessment Report focuses on, major effects of climate change, and so on.

Wait, I need to make sure each question is distinct and covers different aspects. Let me brainstorm some areas: purpose, composition, reports, impacts, adaptation strategies, mitigation methods, future projections, cooperation with other groups, and specific countries involved.

Now, for each topic, I should form a relevant question and the corresponding correct answer based on the context provided. I'll have to ensure that the answers are directly or inferably extractable from the given information.

Let me check if there's enough information in the context to create 10 questions. The context mentions the IPCC's role, its reports, focus areas like mitigation and adaptation, impacts on ecosystems and human health, and cooperation with organizations like UNEP and WHO.

I should avoid repeating similar questions. For example, one about the main goal can be followed by another about specific impacts or actions recommended.

Let me draft each pair step by step:

1. What is the primary focus of the IPCC? - To assess the scientific basis of climate change.
2. Which countries participate in the IPCC? - Over 193 members from around the world.
3. What does the Fourth Assessment Report highlight? - The link between human activities and climate change.
4. What are the main impacts of climate change as per the IPCC? - Rising temperatures, melting ice, and altered rainfall patterns.
5. Which adaptation strategy is recommended by the IPCC? - Building resilient infrastructure and communities.
6. What is a key mitigation action suggested by the IPCC? - Reducing greenhouse gas emissions through renewable energy use.
7. How does the IPCC project future climate conditions? - Using comprehensive models and data analysis.
8. Which organizations often collaborate with the IPCC on reports? - UN Environment Programme (UNEP) and World Health Organization (WHO).
9. What is the overall goal of IPCC's assessments? - To provide policymakers with scientific information for decision-making.
10. Which region is particularly affected by rising sea levels as per the IPCC? - Small island nations and coastal areas.

I think that covers a good range of topics without repetition. Now, I'll format them into CSV lines accordingly.
