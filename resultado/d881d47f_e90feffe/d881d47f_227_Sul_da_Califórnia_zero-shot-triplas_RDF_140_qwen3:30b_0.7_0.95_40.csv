The data for Southern California includes "ns2:populationAsOf '2020'"; but no actual population number. So the answer would be "2020" if the question is about the year. So a question could be "In which year was the population of Southern California recorded?" Answer: 2020.
Another possible question is about the total area in square kilometers; but the data only has square miles. So "What is the total area of Southern California in square miles?" Answer: 56505.
Wait; the user wants 10 pairs. Let me list possible ones:
   Answer: Not specified (but the data only has the year; not the number. Maybe rephrase the question.)
   Alternatively; "In which year was the population of Southern California recorded?" Answer: 2020
   Answer: The resource itself (but the data shows foaf:primaryTopic as the same resource; which might not be useful. Maybe another approach.)
Wait; but the data mentions "Southern California" as the name. So maybe that's redundant. Let me check again.
Alternatively; the question could be "What is the name of the region that includes cities like Los Angeles and San Diego?" Answer: Southern California.
I need to ensure the answers are directly from the data. For example; the subdivisions are listed as specific counties. So the answer to question 2 would be 6 counties. The answer to question 7 would be the list of counties.
