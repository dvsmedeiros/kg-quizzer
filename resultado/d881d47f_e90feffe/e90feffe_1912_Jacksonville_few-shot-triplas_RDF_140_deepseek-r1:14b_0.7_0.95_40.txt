Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs based on the information provided about Jacksonville, Florida. Let me start by reviewing the data given.

First, I see that Jacksonville has a population of 1,345,596 in 2010. It's the largest city in Florida and ranks 12th in the U.S. by population. It's located in Duval County, which it consolidated with in 1968. The area was originally inhabited by the Timucua people before a French colony called Fort Caroline was established there in 1564. The city is named after Andrew Jackson.

Looking at the examples provided, I notice that each question has a clear structure and expects a concise answer. My goal is to create similar questions, ensuring they are unique and cover different aspects of Jacksonville's information.

I should think about various categories: population stats, geographical details, historical facts, neighboring cities, economic aspects, natural features, transportation, notable events, climate, and cultural elements.

Let me list possible questions:

1. What is the name of the river near Jacksonville?
2. What is Jacksonville's rank in population among U.S. cities?
3. Which county does Jacksonville belong to?
4. When did Jacksonville merge with Duval County?
5. Who was Fort Caroline named after?
6. How far is Jacksonville from Miami?
7. What is Jacksonville known for economically or culturally?
8. What natural areas are close to Jacksonville?
9. What major highways pass through the city?
10. What famous events happened in Jacksonville?

Wait, I need to make sure each answer is directly supported by the data provided. For example, the river nearby is St. Johns, and the population rank is 12th.

I should avoid repeating questions from the examples. The user has already included some questions like city population and French colony details, so I can focus on others.

Let me structure each question to be clear and direct, ensuring they are distinct and cover a range of topics related to Jacksonville.
