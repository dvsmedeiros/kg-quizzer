Okay, the user wants me to generate 10 objective questions and answers based on the context of the Franco-Indigenous War. Let me start by recalling what I know about this topic. The Franco-Indigenous War, also known as the French and Indian War, was a conflict between France and the British, with Native American allies on both sides. It took place from 1754 to 1763.

First, I need to make sure that the questions are varied and cover different aspects. Let me think about the key points: the time period, the main parties involved, the outcome, the impact on Native American tribes, the role of key figures, and maybe the consequences of the war.

I should avoid repeating similar questions. For example, one question could be about the duration of the war. Another about the main opposing sides. Then, maybe the outcome, the significance of the war, the key events, the role of specific tribes, the role of the British, the role of France, the impact on the American colonies, and the long-term effects on Native American populations.

I need to ensure that each question has a single correct answer. Let me check each point to make sure the answers are accurate. For example, the war was between France and Britain, with Native American allies. The outcome was Britain's victory, leading to the Seven Years' War. The war was a major turning point in the French colonial empire's decline in North America.

Wait, the user mentioned "Guerra_Franco-Indígena" which is the French and Indian War. I should confirm the correct names and dates. The war started in 1754 and ended in 1763. The main participants were the French, the British, and various Native American tribes. The key events include the Battle of the French and Indian War, the Treaty of Paris, and the expansion of British influence.

I need to make sure that the answers are directly derived from the context. Let me list out possible questions and answers:

1. When did the French and Indian War take place?
2. Which countries were the main participants in the French and Indian War?
3. What was the outcome of the French and Indian War?
4. Which Native American tribes were allies with the French?
5. What was the significance of the French and Indian War in the context of colonial expansion?
6. Who was the main British commander in the French and Indian War?
7. What was the role of the Native American tribes in the French and Indian War?
8. How did the French and Indian War affect the American colonies?
9. What was the name of the treaty that ended the French and Indian War?
10. What was the long-term consequence of the French and Indian War for Native American populations?

Wait, the user specified "Guerra_Franco-Indígena", which is the French and Indian War. The Seven Years' War is a broader conflict that included this war in North America. So I need to make sure the answers are accurate. The French and Indian War was part of the Seven Years' War, which lasted from 1756 to 1763. But the French and Indian War specifically was from 1754 to 1763.

I should check if the questions are correctly framed. For example, question 5 could be about the significance of the war in the context of colonial expansion. Also, the answer about the role of Native American tribes should mention their alliances with both sides.

I need to ensure that each answer is correct and based on the context. Once I have the 10 questions, I can format them into the CSV as specified, with each pair separated by a semicolon. Let me make sure there are exactly 10 pairs and that each question is unique and covers different aspects.
