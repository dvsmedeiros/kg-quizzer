Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the provided context and facts about economic inequality. First, I need to make sure I understand the requirements thoroughly.

The context explains that economic inequality involves income, wealth, and consumption distribution. It mentions the Gini Coefficient and the Inequality-adjusted HDI. Also, there are facts from DBpedia linking various resources to economic inequality. The examples given are specific, like percentages of wealth held by the top 1% or 85 people.

I need to create questions that are varied and cover different aspects of the content. Each question must have a single correct answer derived directly from the context or facts. No repetition of similar questions. The answers should be concise and accurate.

Looking at the context, possible angles include the Gini Coefficient, types of inequality measures, the impact of globalization, concepts like equity and equality of opportunity, and specific statistics from the facts. The facts mention things like the top 1% holding 40% of assets, the 85 richest people equivalent to 3.5 billion people, and the 1% having half the wealth by 2016.

I need to ensure that each question is unique. For example, one could ask about the Gini Coefficient, another about the Inequality-adjusted HDI, another about the effect of globalization on inequality, and so on. Also, using the specific numbers from the examples, like 40%, 3.5 billion, etc.

I should avoid using any markdown and just provide the CSV. Each line should be "pergunta;resposta". Let me check the examples given to ensure I'm following the style. The answers are direct, often numerical or specific terms.

Now, let me list possible questions:

1. What is the most commonly used measure of economic inequality?
2. What does the Inequality-adjusted HDI consider?
3. How does globalization affect inequality between and within countries?
4. What are the three main aspects measured in economic inequality?
5. What is the term for the distribution of income?
6. What is the term for the distribution of wealth?
7. According to the facts, what percentage of global assets does the top 1% hold?
8. What is the name of the index that adjusts the HDI for inequality?
9. What is the impact of higher inequality on economic growth?
10. What concepts are related to economic equality?

Now, check if these are all covered in the context. The Gini Coefficient is mentioned as the most used. The Inequality-adjusted HDI is mentioned. Globalization reduces between-country inequality but increases within. The three aspects are income, wealth, consumption. The terms are distribution of income (income inequality) and distribution of wealth (wealth inequality). The facts mention 40% for the top 1%, the Inequality-adjusted HDI, and that higher inequality slows growth. Concepts like equity and equality of opportunity are in the context.

Now, craft the questions and answers:

1. What is the most commonly used measure of economic inequality?;Gini Coefficient
2. What does the Inequality-adjusted HDI consider?;inequality in human development
3. How does globalization affect inequality between and within countries?;reduces between-country but increases within-country
4. What are the three main aspects measured in economic inequality?;income, wealth, consumption
5. What is the term for the distribution of income?;income inequality
6. What is the term for the distribution of wealth?;wealth inequality
7. According to the facts, what percentage of global assets does the top 1% hold?;40%
8. What is the name of the index that adjusts the HDI for inequality?;Inequality-adjusted HDI
9. What is the impact of higher inequality on economic growth?;slows growth
10. What concepts are related to economic equality?;equity, equality of opportunity

Check for uniqueness and correctness. Ensure answers are from the context. For example, the Gini Coefficient is mentioned as the most used. The Inequality-adjusted HDI is mentioned. Globalization's effect is stated. The three aspects are listed. The terms for income and wealth distribution are correct. The 40% figure is in the facts. The Inequality-adjusted HDI is named. The impact on growth is mentioned. Concepts like equity and equality of opportunity are in the context.

Looks good. Now format as CSV without markdown.
