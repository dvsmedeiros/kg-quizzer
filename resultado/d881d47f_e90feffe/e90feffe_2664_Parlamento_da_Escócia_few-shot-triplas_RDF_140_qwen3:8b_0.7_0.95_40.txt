Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs based on the provided information about the Scottish Parliament. Let me start by reviewing the data given.

First, the examples show questions about the establishment of the Parliament, the 1998 Scotland Act, legislative powers, reserved powers, historical context, and key events like the 1973 Kilbrandon Report. The answers are concise, factual, and often reference specific dates or acts.

Looking at the dataset, there's a lot of information about the Scottish Parliament's structure, its committees, election dates, leaders, and related parties. I should focus on extracting key facts that can form questions. For example, the last election date is 2021-05-06, which could be a question about when the last election was. Also, the number of members is 129, so that's another possible question.

I need to ensure that the questions are clear and the answers are accurate based on the data provided. Let me check for other notable points: the location is the Scottish Parliament Building, the leader is Alison Johnstone, the Presiding Officer is mentioned, and there are various committees listed. Also, the political groups include "Government", "In co-operation with", and "Opposition".

I should also consider the historical context, like the establishment in 1999, the 1998 Scotland Act, and the Kilbrandon Report from 1973. There's mention of the UK Parliament's reserved powers and the role of the Scottish Government. 

I need to avoid repeating the examples and ensure each question is unique. Let me list possible questions and corresponding answers:

1. When was the Scottish Parliament established? – 1999.
2. What is the location of the Scottish Parliament? – Scottish Parliament Building.
3. How many members does the Scottish Parliament have? – 129.
4. Who is the current leader of the Scottish Parliament? – Alison Johnstone.
5. What act established the Scottish Parliament's powers? – Scotland Act 1998.
6. Which UK Parliament body has reserved powers? – UK Parliament (Westminster).
7. What is the role of the Presiding Officer? – Oversees parliamentary proceedings.
8. What are some of the committees of the Scottish Parliament? – Health and Sport, Justice, etc.
9. What was the date of the last election? – 2021-05-06.
10. What did the Kilbrandon Report recommend in 1973? – Establish an elected Scottish Assembly.

I need to verify that these answers are accurate based on the data. For example, the Scotland Act 1998 is mentioned in the examples, so that's correct. The number of members is 129 as per the data. The last election date is 2021-05-06. The Kilbrandon Report is mentioned in the examples as recommending an elected assembly, which aligns with the data.

I should also check for any other key points. The Scottish Government is responsible to the Parliament, and the Presiding Officer is a role within the Parliament. The committees listed include Health and Sport, Justice, etc. The leader is Alison Johnstone, and the location is the Scottish Parliament Building.

These 10 questions cover different aspects of the Scottish Parliament, including establishment, structure, functions, and historical context. They should be clear and answerable based on the provided information.
