Okay, the user wants me to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the provided context about British Satellite Broadcasting (BSB). Let me start by carefully reading the context and facts given.

First, the context says that BSB was a TV company based in London, providing direct satellite TV services for the UK. It was incorporated in November 1990 to form BSkyB, and it started transmitting on March 25, 1990. The facts include various RDF triples that mention BSB's role in producing or owning TV channels, its founding date, location, and merger with Sky Television to form BSkyB.

I need to create 10 unique questions that cover different aspects of the information. Let me list out the key points from the context:

1. BSB's location (Londres)
2. BSB's role in providing satellite TV services
3. Incorporation date (November 1990)
4. Formation of BSkyB
5. Start date of transmission (March 25, 1990)
6. BSB's relation to other companies (like Sky Television)
7. BSB's production companies (e.g., Galaxy channel, Hardware film, Memphis Belle film, etc.)
8. BSB's successor (Sky UK)
9. BSB's founding year (1986)
10. BSB's status as a defunct company

Now, I need to make sure the questions are varied and not repetitive. Let me think of different angles:

- When was BSB incorporated?
- Where was BSB based?
- What was the start date of BSB's transmission?
- What company did BSB merge with to form BSkyB?
- What were some of the TV channels owned by BSB?
- What was BSB's successor company?
- What was the founding year of BSB?
- What is the name of the company that BSB merged with?
- What was the fate of BSB?
- What was the main service provided by BSB?

I need to check each question to ensure the answer is directly from the provided facts. For example, the incorporation date is November 1990, the start date is March 25, 1990, the merger was with Sky Television, and the successor is Sky UK. The founding year is 1986, and the company is now defunct.

I should also make sure that the answers are correct and directly derived from the context. For example, the answer to "What was the name of the company that BSB merged with?" is Sky Television, not Sky UK. The successor is Sky UK. Also, the main service is direct satellite TV.

Let me structure the questions accordingly, making sure each is unique and covers different aspects. Avoid repetition, like not asking the same question in different forms. Check for 10 distinct points. Once that's done, format them into the CSV with the correct separators.
