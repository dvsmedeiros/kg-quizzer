Okay, I need to generate 10 CSV pairs based on the provided context and facts about the IPCC. Let me start by understanding the requirements. The user wants questions and answers in Portuguese, separated by semicolons, with each question and answer pair on a new line.

First, I'll go through the context and facts to identify key points. The IPCC was established in 1988 by the UN, specifically the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). It's an intergovernmental body that synthesizes scientific knowledge on climate change. It doesn't conduct original research but summarizes existing studies. The IPCC has produced several reports and was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2007. Notable individuals associated with it include Bert Bolin, Rajendra Pachauri, and Hoesung Lee.

Looking at the facts, there's a lot of information about the structure, members, and associated organizations. For example, the IPCC is based in Geneva, Switzerland, and has a chairperson. There are also mentions of specific reports like "Renewable Energy Sources and Climate Change Mitigation" authored by the IPCC. Other facts include the use of certain Wikipedia templates and categories, which might not be directly relevant to the questions but could be used for specific details.

Now, I need to create 10 varied questions. Let me brainstorm possible questions:

1. What is the full name of the IPCC? (Answer: Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change)
2. Which organizations established the IPCC? (Answer: UN Environment Programme and WMO)
3. Where is the IPCC based? (Answer: Geneva, Switzerland)
4. What award did the IPCC receive in 2007? (Answer: Nobel Peace Prize)
5. Who is the current chairperson of the IPCC? (Answer: Hoesung Lee)
6. Which report was authored by the IPCC? (Answer: Renewable Energy Sources and Climate Change Mitigation)
7. Who was the first chairman of the IPCC? (Answer: Bert Bolin)
8. What is the main objective of the IPCC? (Answer: To synthesize and disseminate knowledge on climate change)
9. Which UN agency is the IPCC part of? (Answer: United Nations Environment Programme)
10. What is the abbreviation for the IPCC? (Answer: IPCC)

Wait, the user's examples include questions about the parent organizations, the first president, and the year of resignation. I need to ensure the questions are varied and not repetitive. Let me check the facts again to find more unique details. For instance, the IPCC is part of the WMO, the organization-mãe is the UNEP and WMO, the Nobel Prize, the chairperson's name, the location, the abbreviation, and some specific reports or authors.

I should avoid repeating the same type of questions. For example, the examples already have questions about the parent organizations, the first president, and the Nobel Prize. Let me make sure each question targets a different aspect. Also, the answer must be directly inferable from the context or facts provided.

Let me structure the CSV pairs accordingly, ensuring each question is unique and the answers are correct based on the given information. I'll need to double-check the facts to confirm the accuracy of each answer. For example, the chairperson is Hoesung Lee, the headquarters is Geneva, the Nobel Prize in 2007, and the abbreviation IPCC. The report "Renewable Energy Sources and Climate Change Mitigation" is mentioned as an author. Also, the fact that it's part of the UN Environment Programme and WMO. The first chairman is Bert Bolin, and the current chair is Hoesung Lee. The Nobel Prize is mentioned in the context. The abbreviation is given in the facts as IPCC.

Now, compiling these into 10 unique questions and answers in Portuguese, making sure the answers are correct and the questions are varied. Let me ensure that each answer is explicitly stated or can be inferred from the provided context and facts.
