Okay, I need to create 10 pairs of questions and answers based on the provided context about Islamism. First, I'll go through each fact in the "Fatos" section to identify relevant information that can be turned into questions.

Looking at the first few facts:
- Al Wefaq has Islamism.
- The 19th Division (Syrian rebel group) has Islamism.
- Movement for Democracy in Algeria has Islamism.
- Hefazat-e-Islam Bangladesh is an Islamism.
  
I can create a question about which rebel groups have Islamic ideology. That seems like a good start.

Next, I see that Islamism uses a template called Main list and has various examples listed under "Fatos." Maybe I can ask for the most common example of an Islamic group with this ideology.

The word "Islamism" appears multiple times with different attributes, so perhaps another question could be about its type or category. Looking at one fact: "Islamism é do tipo Cognition100023271," which seems like a classification using a specific system. I can ask for this classification.

Another fact mentions that Islamism uses the Template:Main list, so maybe a question asking what template it uses would be appropriate.

The word "Al-Wefaq" is highlighted with bold text, indicating its prominence in the context. So a possible question could be about the most prominent Islamic group mentioned.

I notice that many of the facts are names of groups or organizations with Islamism. To test knowledge on this list, I can create a general question asking which organization has Islamic ideology based on the provided examples.

Looking through the facts again, I find several instances where "islam" is used in Portuguese, but that might be a typo since we're focusing on English content. Maybe it's not relevant here.

Another fact mentions "Al-Muwatin" and "Awami Muslim League (Pakistan)" having Islamic ideology. So another question could ask which organization in Pakistan has Islamic ideology based on these examples.

I also see that the word "Yasser Harrak" is linked to Islamism, so a possible question could be about someone associated with this ideology.

The fact states that Islamism é do tipo SpeechAct107160883. So asking what type it is would make sense as another question.

Lastly, there's mention of the Islamic Salafi Alliance having Islamic ideology, so I can ask which alliance has this ideology based on the provided examples.

I think these 10 questions cover a good range of aspects from different facts and should provide clear, unique answers based on the context.
