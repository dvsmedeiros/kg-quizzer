Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to generate 10 CSV pairs of questions and answers based on the provided context and facts. First, I need to make sure I understand all the requirements. The questions must be varied, cover different aspects, and each have a single correct answer that's explicit or inferable from the content. No repetition of similar questions, and only the CSV output without any extra text.

Looking at the context, the main points are about the immune system, its components, functions, and related terms. The facts list various elements like white blood cells, specific cells (like B cells, T cells, macrophages), and some medical conditions (like sepsis, food allergies, autoimmune diseases). Also, there are mentions of models and templates used in Wikipedia, which might be relevant for some questions.

I need to create questions that cover different areas. For example, some questions can be about the components of the immune system, others about functions, diseases related to immune system issues, and maybe some about the structure or classification. Let me start by listing possible questions:

1. What is the primary function of the immune system? (Answer: Protect against diseases)
2. Who is considered the father of immunology? (Answer: Ilya Ilyich Mechnikov)
3. What are the two main types of immunity? (Answer: Innate and adaptive)
4. Which cell is part of the immune system? (Answer: B cell, T cell, etc.)
5. What is the term for an overactive immune system attacking normal tissues? (Answer: Autoimmunity)
6. What is the result of immunodeficiency? (Answer: Recurrent infections)
7. Which condition is caused by the immune system attacking the body's own tissues? (Answer: Autoimmune disease)
8. What is the role of the lymphatic system in the immune system? (Answer: Part of the immune system)
9. Which disease is associated with the immune system? (Answer: Sepsis, Food allergy)
10. What is the term for the memory response in the immune system? (Answer: Adaptive immunity)

Wait, I need to ensure each question is unique and covers different aspects. Let me check the facts again. The facts mention various cells like neutrophil, eosinophil, mast cell, etc. Also, there's information about the lymphatic system being part of the immune system. The models and templates might be a bit tricky, but the user's examples don't include those, so maybe focus on the main content.

Another angle: the immune system's components and their roles. For example, the lymphatic system is part of the immune system. Also, the immune system's role in vaccination and memory. Maybe questions about the models used in Wikipedia, but the user's examples don't include those, so perhaps avoid unless necessary.

Let me structure the 10 questions:

1. What is the primary function of the immune system? (Answer: Protect against diseases)
2. Who is considered the father of immunology? (Answer: Ilya Ilyich Mechnikov)
3. What are the two main types of immunity? (Answer: Innate and adaptive)
4. Which cell is part of the immune system? (Answer: B cell)
5. What is the term for an overactive immune system attacking normal tissues? (Answer: Autoimmunity)
6. What is the result of immunodeficiency? (Answer: Recurrent infections)
7. Which condition is caused by the immune system attacking the body's own tissues? (Answer: Autoimmune disease)
8. What is the role of the lymphatic system in the immune system? (Answer: Part of the immune system)
9. Which disease is associated with the immune system? (Answer: Sepsis)
10. What is the term for the memory response in the immune system? (Answer: Adaptive immunity)

Wait, some answers might be too broad. Let me check the facts again. The user's examples include questions about the two types of immunity, which are innate and adaptive. Also, the facts mention that the immune system has components like B cells, T cells, etc. So, for question 4, the answer could be "B cell" as an example. Similarly, for question 8, the lymphatic system is part of the immune system. 

Another point: the context mentions that the immune system uses certain templates in Wikipedia, but the examples don't include those, so maybe focus on the main content. Also, the user's examples have answers like "imunidade humoral versus imunidade mediada por células" for the two types of immunity. 

I need to make sure each answer is directly from the context or facts. Let me verify each answer:

- Protect against diseases: Yes, from the context.
- Ilya Ilyich Mechnikov: Yes, from the context.
- Innate and adaptive: Yes, from the context.
- B cell: Yes, from the facts.
- Autoimmunity: Yes, from the context.
- Immunodeficiency: Yes, from the context.
- Autoimmune disease: Yes, context.
- Lymphatic system part of immune system: Yes, facts mention "Lymphatic system" as a template used.
- Sepsis: Yes, facts mention sepsis as a cause related to the immune system.
- Adaptive immunity: Yes, context mentions memory immunological response as the basis for vaccination, which is part of adaptive immunity.

I think these cover different aspects. Now, ensure that each question is unique and answers are correct. Let me structure them in CSV format, making sure the answers are concise and match the required format.
