Okay, I need to generate 10 CSV pairs of questions and answers based on the context provided about the Black Death. Let me start by recalling the key points about the Black Death. 

First, the Black Death was a pandemic that occurred in the 14th century, primarily in Europe. It was caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis, which was spread by fleas on rats. The disease had three main forms: bubonic, septicemic, and pneumonic. The bubonic plague was the most common, causing swollen lymph nodes called buboes. The mortality rate was extremely high, with estimates suggesting that around 30-60% of the European population died. The pandemic had significant social, economic, and cultural impacts, including labor shortages, changes in social structures, and the persecution of minorities like the Jews.

Now, I need to create 10 varied questions. Let me list possible questions:

1. What was the primary cause of the Black Death?
2. Which form of the plague was the most common?
3. What was the estimated mortality rate in Europe?
4. How was the Black Death primarily transmitted?
5. What were the three main forms of the plague?
6. Which group was persecuted during the Black Death?
7. What were the swollen lymph nodes called in the bubonic plague?
8. When did the Black Death primarily occur?
9. What was the impact of the Black Death on Europe's population?
10. What was the role of rats in the spread of the Black Death?

Wait, I need to ensure each question is distinct and covers different aspects. Let me check if these are all unique and cover various points. 

For the answers, I need to make sure they are accurate based on the context. For example, the primary cause is Yersinia pestis, transmitted by fleas on rats. The three forms are bubonic, septicemic, and pneumonic. The mortality rate is 30-60%. The persecution of Jews is a key point. 

I should structure each pair with the question and answer in Portuguese, using semicolons. Let me translate the questions and answers into Portuguese, ensuring the answers are correct and directly from the context. 

I need to avoid repetition and ensure each question is about a different aspect. Let me make sure there are no similar questions. Once I have 10, I can format them into CSV as specified.
