Okay, I need to generate 10 pairs of questions and answers in CSV format based on the provided context and facts. Let me start by understanding the context. The main topic is Computational Complexity Theory in computer science and mathematics. The facts mention various people associated with it, like Nikolai Bakhvalov, Jelani Nelson, Ryan Williams, Vijay Vazirani, etc. Also, there are some classifications and types mentioned, such as PsychologicalFeature100023100, Structure105726345, etc.

The user wants questions that are varied and cover different aspects. Each question must have a single correct answer, which should be explicitly or inferably from the given content. I need to avoid repeating similar questions. Let me brainstorm possible questions.

First, the definition of Computational Complexity Theory. Then, who are some notable people in the field. Also, the classification types, like the types mentioned (PsychologicalFeature100023100, etc.), and the models used (wiki templates like Template:Computer science, Template:Quote, etc.). Also, the categories or topics related, like the main subject Category:Computational complexity theory, and the types like WikicatAlgorithms, WikicatDataStructures, etc.

I need to make sure each question is unique. Let me check the facts again. The facts mention various people, so questions about who is known for the theory, or who works in the field. Also, the types and classifications, and the models used in wiki pages. Also, the categories and topics related.

Let me start listing possible questions:

1. What is the main focus of Computational Complexity Theory?
2. Who is known for Computational Complexity Theory?
3. What is a classification type of Computational Complexity Theory?
4. What is a model used in the wiki page for Computational Complexity Theory?
5. What is a category associated with Computational Complexity Theory?
6. What is a type of Computational Complexity Theory?
7. Who are some notable researchers in Computational Complexity Theory?
8. What is the main subject of Computational Complexity Theory?
9. What are some models used in the wiki page for Computational Complexity Theory?
10. What is the primary classification of Computational Complexity Theory?

Wait, but some of these might be similar. Let me check the facts again. The facts mention that Computational Complexity Theory is classified under various types like PsychologicalFeature100023100, Structure105726345, etc. Also, the models include Template:Computer science, Template:Quote, etc. The categories include Category:Computational complexity theory, and the main subject is Computational complexity theory. Also, the people listed are Nikolai Bakhvalov, Jelani Nelson, Ryan Williams, etc.

So, for the questions, I can make them about:

- Definition
- Notable people
- Types/Classifications
- Models used in wiki
- Categories
- Main subject
- Other related fields or subfields

Let me structure them:

1. What is the primary focus of Computational Complexity Theory?
2. Who is known for Computational Complexity Theory?
3. What is a classification type of Computational Complexity Theory?
4. What is a model used in the wiki page for Computational Complexity Theory?
5. What is a category associated with Computational Complexity Theory?
6. What is a type of Computational Complexity Theory?
7. Who are some notable researchers in Computational Complexity Theory?
8. What is the main subject of Computational Complexity Theory?
9. What are some models used in the wiki page for Computational Complexity Theory?
10. What is the primary classification of Computational Complexity Theory?

But I need to ensure the answers are from the given facts. Let me check the facts again. The facts mention:

- Computational complexity theory is classified under PsychologicalFeature100023100, Structure105726345, etc.
- Models used: Template:Computer science, Template:Quote, Template:Garey-Johnson, etc.
- Categories: Category:Computational complexity theory.
- The main subject is Computational complexity theory.
- People known for it: Nikolai Bakhvalov, Jelani Nelson, etc.

So, for the answers, I need to pick from these. Let me make sure each question is unique and the answer is in the facts.

Now, I need to format them into CSV pairs. Let me write them out:

1. What is the primary focus of Computational Complexity Theory? -> classificação de problemas computacionais de acordo com seu uso de recursos.
2. Who is known for Computational Complexity Theory? -> Nikolai Sergeevich Bakhvalov.
3. What is a classification type of Computational Complexity Theory? -> PsychologicalFeature100023100.
4. What is a model used in the wiki page for Computational Complexity Theory? -> Template:Computer science.
5. What is a category associated with Computational Complexity Theory? -> Category:Computational complexity theory.
6. What is a type of Computational Complexity Theory? -> Structure105726345.
7. Who are some notable researchers in Computational Complexity Theory? -> Jelani Nelson.
8. What is the main subject of Computational Complexity Theory? -> Computational complexity theory.
9. What are some models used in the wiki page for Computational Complexity Theory? -> Template:Quote.
10. What is the primary classification of Computational Complexity Theory? -> Computational complexity classes.

Wait, but the facts mention "Computational complexity theory tem o título de Computational complexity classes" so that's the primary classification.

Yes, that seems correct. I need to make sure all answers are from the given facts. Let me check again. The answer for question 10 is from the fact that "Computational complexity theory tem o título de Computational complexity classes".

Okay, that's all. Now, format them as CSV pairs with semicolons.
