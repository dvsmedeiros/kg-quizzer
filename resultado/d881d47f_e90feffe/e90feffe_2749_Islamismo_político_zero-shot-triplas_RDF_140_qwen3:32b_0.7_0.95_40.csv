pergunta;resposta
Okay, let's see. The user provided a bunch of RDF triples where various entities are linked to "Islamism". They want me to generate 10 question-answer pairs based on this data. The instructions mention that each question should be in Portuguese, the answer in Portuguese, and they should be in the format "pergunta;resposta". Also, the answers need to be direct and concise, not just "sim" or "n√£o", and each pair should be on a new line.
