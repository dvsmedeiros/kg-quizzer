Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs based on the provided data about Jacksonville, Florida. Let me start by reviewing the data to identify key points that can form valid questions. 

First, the data mentions that Jacksonville is the largest city in Florida by population, with a population rank of 1. That's a good starting point for a question. Also, the population in 2010 was 1,345,596, which is already covered in the example. However, maybe I can ask about the current population or other years if available, but the data doesn't specify that. 

The official name is "City of Jacksonville and Duval County," so a question about the official name could be another pair. The consolidation year is 1968, which was already asked in the example. The river next to Jacksonville is the St. Johns River, so that's a valid question. 

Looking at the area land, it's 1935.5 square kilometers (since the value is 1935498000.0, but that might be in square meters, so converting to square kilometers would be 1935.5). Wait, the data says "ns2:areaLand "1935498000.0" ;" which is in square meters, so converting to square kilometers is 1935.498 km². That's a possible question about the area.

The data also lists some historical events like the Skirmish at Cedar Creek, but that might not be directly related to Jacksonville. Wait, no, the Skirmish at Cedar Creek is listed under places, but I need to check if that's correct. However, the data says "ns2:place <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jacksonville,_Florida> ;" for Skirmish at Cedar Creek, which might be a mistake. But since the user provided that, maybe it's a point to include. However, the example doesn't have that, so maybe it's better to focus on the more straightforward facts.

Other details include the decRecordHighF ("85"), febRecordLowF ("10"), janRecordHighF ("85"), octAvgRecordHighF ("89.1"), which are temperature records. So a question about the record high temperature in December could be a pair. Similarly, the record low in February is 10°F.

The subdivision type is a U.S. state, which is redundant because Jacksonville is in Florida, so that might not be a useful question. The image map is "Duval County Florida Incorporated and Unincorporated areas Jacksonville Highlighted.svg," but that's probably not a common knowledge fact.

The population rank is 1 in Florida, but the example already asks about that. However, the question could also be about the population rank in the United States, but the data doesn't provide that. The example mentions that Jacksonville is 12th in the U.S. based on population, but that's from the example, not the data. Wait, the user's example includes a question about the ranking in the U.S., which is 12th, but the data provided doesn't explicitly state that. The data only has "populationRank "1" ;" which is for Florida. So the 12th rank in the U.S. might be from the example, not the data. However, the user's instruction says to base the answers strictly on the provided data. So I need to avoid including information not present in the data.

Other points: the city was consolidated into Duval County in 1968, which is already in the example. The river is St. Johns, which is covered. The historical figure Andrew Jackson is mentioned, which is in the example. The French colony was Fort Caroline, also in the example.

So, possible new questions based on the data:

1. What is the area of Jacksonville, Florida in square kilometers? (1935.5 km²)
2. What is the record high temperature in Jacksonville for January? (85°F)
3. What is the record low temperature in Jacksonville for February? (10°F)
4. What is the average high temperature in October in Jacksonville? (89.1°F)
5. What is the official name of Jacksonville, Florida? ("City of Jacksonville and Duval County")
6. What is the name of the river that runs alongside Jacksonville? (St. Johns River)
7. In what year did Jacksonville consolidate with Duval County? (1968)
8. What is the population rank of Jacksonville within the state of Florida? (1st)
9. What is the name of the historical figure after whom Jacksonville is named? (Andrew Jackson)
10. What is the name of the French colony established in 1564? (Fort Caroline)

Wait, some of these are already in the example. For instance, the population rank in Florida is already asked, the river is mentioned, the consolidation year is there. So I need to find questions that are not covered in the examples.

Looking again, the data includes "ns1:blankName <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Federal_Information_Processing_Standard> ;" but that's unclear. Maybe not useful.

The data also has "ns1:wikiPageUsesTemplate <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Template:Reflist>, <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Template:Start_date_and_age> ;" but that's about templates used, not useful for questions.

Another point is the subject category: "Category:Cities in Florida" under dcterms:subject. But that's a classification, not a direct fact.

The areaLand is 1935498000.0, which is 1935.498 square kilometers. That's a unique fact not covered in the example. So that's a good question.

The temperature records: December's record high is 85°F, which is also covered in the example? Let me check the example. The example has a question about the record high in January (85°F) and the record low in February (10°F). So the December record high isn't in the example. So that's a new question.

Also, the October average high is 89.1°F, which could be another question.

The official name is "City of Jacksonville and Duval County," which is a unique fact not covered in the example. The example mentions the official name as "City of Jacksonville and Duval County" but the user's example has a question about the official name. Wait, the user's example includes a question: "Qual é o nome da colônia francesa fundada em 1564?;Fort Caroline," which is in Portuguese. The official name question is not in the example. So that's a valid question.

So compiling the possible questions:

1. What is the area of Jacksonville, Florida in square kilometers? (1935.5 km²)
2. What is the record high temperature in Jacksonville for December? (85°F)
3. What is the average high temperature in October in Jacksonville? (89.1°F)
4. What is the official name of Jacksonville, Florida? ("City of Jacksonville and Duval County")
5. What is the name of the river that runs alongside Jacksonville? (St. Johns River)
6. In what year did Jacksonville consolidate with Duval County? (1968)
7. What is the population rank of Jacksonville within the state of Florida? (1st)
8. What is the name of the historical figure after whom Jacksonville is named? (Andrew Jackson)
9. What is the name of the French colony established in 1564? (Fort Caroline)
10. What is the record low temperature in Jacksonville for February? (10°F)

Now, checking for duplicates. The example already includes the population rank, consolidation year, river name, Fort Caroline, and Andrew Jackson. So the new questions would be 1, 2, 3, 4, 10. But the user's example has "Qual era a população da cidade de Jacksonville em 2010?;1.345.596" which is in Portuguese, but the user's instruction is to generate in Portuguese as well, since the examples are in Portuguese. Wait, the user provided the initial data in Portuguese and the examples in Portuguese. The user's final instruction is to generate the 10 pairs in Portuguese. So the questions need to be in Portuguese. Let me adjust that.

So the final answer should be in Portuguese, using the same structure as the examples. Let me rephrase the questions in Portuguese and ensure that the answers are accurate based on the data provided.
