Okay, so I need to create 10 pairs of questions and answers based on the given context about British Satellite Broadcasting (BSB). The user provided some RDF data which I should parse through to extract relevant information. 

First, looking at the main context: BSB was a TV company in London that transmitted via satellite. It was incorporated in November 1990 to form BSkyB and started broadcasting on March 25, 1990.

From the RDF facts, I see that BSB owned several channels like Galaxy (British TV channel), Now Channel, The Movie Channel, etc. There are also mentions of films produced by them, such as "Hardware" and "Memphis Belle." Additionally, there's information about their fate—merging with Sky Television to form BSkyB—and some details about their founding date in 1986.

So, I need to generate varied questions that cover different aspects: when they were founded, when they started broadcasting, who they merged with, what channels they owned, etc. Each question should have a unique correct answer based on the provided data. 

I'll make sure not to repeat similar questions and ensure each one covers a distinct aspect of BSB's history or operations.
