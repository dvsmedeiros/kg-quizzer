Okay, let me start by understanding the user's request. They want 10 pairs of questions and answers in CSV format, based on the provided context and facts. The context is about the European Union's legal system, its institutions, and objectives. The facts mention things like the Law of the European Union, John Bell's involvement, and some Wikipedia templates. 

First, I need to ensure that each question is unique and covers different aspects. The examples given include questions about the definition of EU law, sources, institutions, effects on member states' laws, etc. I should avoid repeating similar questions. 

Looking at the context, key points are the objectives of the EU (promoting peace, values, well-being), institutions (political, social, economic), and the legal order as per the Court of Justice. The facts mention John Bell and Henry Schermers in the Law of the European Union, and some Wikipedia templates used.

I need to make sure the answers are strictly from the provided content. For example, the EU's objective is mentioned, so a question about that is valid. The institutions are political, social, and economic, so a question about them. The Court of Justice's view on EU law as a new international legal order is another point.

Now, checking the facts again: Law of the European Union has a main topic, John Bell works in that area, Common Market Law Review is related, and some Wikipedia templates. However, the user's examples don't include these details, so maybe they want to focus more on the context provided rather than the specific facts like the templates. But the user did include those facts, so perhaps some questions can be based on them.

Wait, the user's examples are all about the legal aspects: sources of law, institutions, effects on member states' laws. But the facts include things like John Bell and Henry Schermers being part of the Law of the European Union. So maybe some questions can be about who is involved in the study of EU law.

Also, the context mentions the European Union's institutions transcending nation-states for cooperation and development. That's another point to consider.

I need to generate 10 questions. Let's start with the main objective of the EU, then the institutions, the legal order, the sources of law, the effect on member states' laws, the three main sources, the main legislative bodies, the role of the Court of Justice, the disciplines related to EU law (like Common Market Law Review), and maybe the scholars involved (John Bell, Henry Schermers).

But I have to ensure that each answer is directly from the context or facts. For example, the answer to "Quais são os objetivos da União Europeia?" is "promover a paz, seus valores e o bem-estar de seus povos".

Another question could be about the institutions that transcend nation-states, which the context says are political, social, and economic.

The Court of Justice's view is that the EU represents a new international legal order.

The three main sources of law are primary, secondary, and complementary, as per the examples.

John Bell is a legal scholar in the Law of the European Union, and Henry Schermers is a subdiscipline of that.

Common Market Law Review is a discipline related to EU law.

The templates are part of the Law of the European Union's page on Wikipedia, but the examples didn't include that, so maybe the user wants to focus on the context rather than the technical Wikipedia details.

So, compiling all these points, I'll structure the 10 pairs accordingly, ensuring no repetition and covering different aspects.
