Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the given context and facts. The context is about computational complexity theory, and there are a bunch of facts provided. 

First, I need to make sure I understand the requirements. The questions should be varied, cover different aspects of the content, and each has a single correct answer from the provided data. No repetition of similar questions. The output must be exactly 10 pairs in CSV, with semicolons as separators.

Looking at the context, the main topic is computational complexity theory. The facts mention various people, models, categories, and other related terms. I need to extract different aspects from these facts.

Let me start by brainstorming possible questions. The context defines computational complexity theory as a branch of theoretical computer science and mathematics that classifies computational problems based on resource usage. So questions about its definition, main focus, key concepts, related disciplines, notable figures, and specific models or categories.

For example:
1. What is the main focus of computational complexity theory? (Answer: classification of computational problems based on resource usage)
2. Who are some researchers associated with it? (Names from the facts)
3. What are the types or categories it belongs to? (Like Thing, Rule105846932, etc.)
4. What models or templates are used in its wiki pages? (Like Template:Computer science, Template:Quote, etc.)
5. What are the key resources measured? (Time and storage, as per examples)
6. What is the main goal of the theory? (Understanding the inherent difficulty of problems)
7. What are some related fields or disciplines? (Computer science, mathematics, etc.)
8. What are the specific categories or types it is classified under? (Like Abstraction100002137, DataStructure105728493, etc.)
9. What are the images associated with it? (Complexity classes.svg, Turing machine 2b.svg, etc.)
10. What are the main areas of study within it? (Complexity classes, algorithms, etc.)

I need to check the facts to ensure the answers are accurate. For instance, the facts mention "Computational complexity theory é do tipo Thing" and "Computational complexity theory é do tipo Algorithm105847438". So questions about types or categories can use those.

Also, the facts list several people like Scott Aaronson, Vijay Vazirani, etc., so questions about notable figures are possible.

The models mentioned include Template:Computer science, Template:Quote, Template:Garey-Johnson, etc. So a question about the wiki models would use those.

Images like "Complexity subsets pspace.svg" and "Turing machine 2b.svg" can be answers to questions about representative images.

I need to avoid repeating similar questions. For example, don't ask about both types and categories if they are similar. Also, ensure each question is unique and covers different aspects.

Now, I'll draft each pair, making sure the answers are directly from the facts. For example, a question about the main goal could be answered with the context's first sentence about classification based on resource use.

Another example: "What is the primary focus of computational complexity theory?" Answer: "classificação de problemas computacionais de acordo com seu uso de recursos".

I need to check that each answer is explicitly stated or inferable from the context and facts. For instance, the fact that "Computational complexity theory é do tipo Thing" can be used in a question about its classification type.

Also, ensure that the questions are in Portuguese and the answers are concise. Avoid any markdown, just the CSV format with semicolons.

Finally, verify that there are exactly 10 pairs and no extra content. Make sure the CSV is correctly formatted with each line having a question and answer separated by a semicolon.
