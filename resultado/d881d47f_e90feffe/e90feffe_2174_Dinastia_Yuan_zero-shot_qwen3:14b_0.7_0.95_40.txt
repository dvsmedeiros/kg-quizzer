Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the context provided, which is about the Yuan Dynasty. Let me start by recalling the key points about the Yuan Dynasty. The Yuan Dynasty was established by Kublai Khan, the grandson of Genghis Khan. It ruled China from 1271 to 1368. The capital was Dadu, which is now Beijing. The dynasty was the first to rule all of China, and they used the Mongol Empire's administrative system. They also had a policy of ethnic classification, dividing people into four classes: Mongols, Semu, Han Chinese, and Southerners. The Yuan Dynasty was known for its expansion, trade, and the use of paper money. They also faced issues like corruption and rebellions, leading to their downfall.

Now, I need to create varied questions covering different aspects. Let me list possible topics: establishment, ruler, capital, duration, administrative system, ethnic policy, economic policies, achievements, reasons for decline, and cultural aspects. Each question should have a clear answer from the context. I need to ensure that each question is unique and doesn't repeat the same information. Also, the answers must be directly inferable from the context provided. Let me check each point again to make sure I don't miss anything.

For example, one question could be about who founded the Yuan Dynasty. The answer is Kublai Khan. Another could be the duration, which is 1271-1368. The capital's name and location, the administrative system, the four ethnic classes, the use of paper money, the impact of corruption, the role of rebellions, and maybe something about the Silk Road or trade under their rule. I need to ensure that each answer is accurate and directly from the context. Once I have these points, I can structure them into the CSV format as specified.
