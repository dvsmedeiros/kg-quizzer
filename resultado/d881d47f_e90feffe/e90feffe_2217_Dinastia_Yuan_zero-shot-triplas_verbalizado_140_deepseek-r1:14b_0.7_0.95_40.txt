Okay, so I need to generate 10 pairs of questions and answers based on the given context about the Yuan dynasty. The user provided a lot of facts in both English and Chinese, which should help in creating accurate questions.

First, I'll go through each fact and think of possible questions that can be formed. For example, since it mentions Kublai Khan as the founder in 1271, a question could ask who founded the Yuan dynasty. Similarly, the fact about it being established in 1271 is another good point for a question.

I should ensure that each question covers different aspects: origins, key figures, establishment year, duration, important events like Kublai Khan's reign, significant battles, and its dissolution in 1368. Also, including questions about notable people who died during the Yuan period adds variety.

I need to make sure each answer is directly supported by the provided facts without adding any extra information. The questions should be clear and varied to cover multiple facets of the Yuan dynasty's history.

Let me start drafting each question and corresponding answer based on the facts:

1. Who founded the Yuan dynasty? - Kublai Khan
2. When was it established? - 1271
3. What marked its establishment? - Kublai's proclamation
4. How long did it last? - Until 1368
5. Key military victory event - Conquest of Song in 1279
6. Who led the dynasty after Kublai Khan? - Temür Khan (Yuan Shizu)
7. Notable person who died - Emperor Gong of Song
8. Capital cities - Khanbaliq and Shangdu
9. Dissolution year - 1368 by Ming dynasty
10. Key figure in military - Kublai Khan

I think this covers a good range, ensuring each is unique and factually correct from the provided data.
