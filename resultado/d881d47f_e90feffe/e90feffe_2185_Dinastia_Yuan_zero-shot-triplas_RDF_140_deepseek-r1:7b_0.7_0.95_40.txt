Ok, I'm trying to create a set of 10 questions and answers related to the Yuan Dynasty based on the provided context and facts. First, I need to understand what the Yuan Dynasty was about. From the context, it seems like it was a Mongol dynasty that lasted from 1271 to 1368. They were known for their military conquests, particularly in China.

Looking at the facts, there are several battles mentioned: Battle of Bun'ei, Battle of Bakhchisaray, Battle of Changford, Lake Po Yang, Pagan, Emperor Gong of Song, Empress Quan of Song, First Mongol invasion of Burma, Gegeen Khan, Jayaatu Khan Tugh Temür. These are all battles that the Yuan Dynasty was involved in.

There's also information about the establishment and dissolution of the dynasty, key figures like Kublai Khan, Qubilai Khan, Bo Xilai, and historical events associated with them. There are mentions of places conquered or occupied by the Yuan Dynasty, such as Lake Tai Ba, Turban Rebellions, etc.

Now, to create the questions and answers, I need to think about different aspects: key figures, battles, conquests, capital, emperors, etc.

1. **Capital**: The Yuan Dynasty's capital was Khanbaliq.
2. **Battles**: Battle of Bakhchisaray involved Kublai Khan.
3. **Emperor**: Emperor Gong of Song was the founder.
4. **Conquered Places**: Lake Tai Ba was conquered by the Yuan.
5. **Dissolution**: The Yuan was dissolved in 1368.
6. **Battalion**: Bo Xilai led a battalion.
7. **Empress**: Empress Quan was married to Kublai Khan.
8. **Birthplace of Prince Bwangneung**: It's Khanbaliq.
9. **Rebelled Kingdom**: The Yuan rebelled against the Mongols in Red Turban Rebellions, which is a bit tricky because it's not exactly a place but an event.
10. **Deputy of Bo Xilai**: Ahmad Fanakati was his deputy.

I think these cover various areas: capitals, battles, key figures, emperors, places, dissolution, battalions, marriages, birthplaces, and rebellions. I need to make sure each question is unique and the answers are accurate based on the facts provided.
