10. Quantos bondes a Fresno Traction Company operava em 1931? (47 bondes) – but the example already has that as "Quantos bondes a Fresno Traction Company operava em 1931?;47 bondes"
Wait, the user's examples include "Quantos bondes a Fresno Traction Company operava em 1931?;47 bondes" as an example. So I can't repeat that. So need to find other questions.
Wait, some of these may overlap with examples, but I need to check. The user's examples include "O que é destaque na bandeira da cidade de Fresno?;folha de freixo" which is about the emblem, but the map caption is "Location within Fresno County". So question 3 is about the map caption, which is different from the emblem.
