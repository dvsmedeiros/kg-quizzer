Okay, so I need to generate 10 question and answer pairs based on the provided context about civil disobedience. The user has given a detailed context and some facts related to it. My task is to create these pairs in CSV format with Portuguese language.

First, I'll read through the context again to understand the key points. Civil disobedience is a form of peaceful protest against unjust laws or oppressive governments. It was first articulated by Henry David Thoreau and later used by Gandhi and Martin Luther King Jr. The context also mentions various protests that have utilized civil disobedience methods.

Now, I need to create varied questions covering different aspects of the context. Each question should have a single correct answer derived from the provided information. Let me brainstorm some potential topics:

1. Definition of civil disobedience.
2. Who first formulated it?
3. Examples of successful applications (Gandhi, King).
4. Situations where it's used.
5. Movements or protests that employed it.

Looking at the facts, there are many specific events listed, so I can include some of those as examples. However, since each question should be unique and cover different aspects, I'll spread out the topics to avoid repetition.

I also need to ensure that the questions are clear and directly relate to the context. For instance, one question could ask about the main characteristic of civil disobedience, another about its originator, and others about specific applications or related movements.

Let me draft some possible questions:

1. What is the main characteristic of civil disobedience?
2. Who originally formulated this concept?
3. Which leader used it in India for independence?
4. How did MLK Jr. use it in the US?
5. In what situation can a population legally disobey their government?
6. What movement in Assam used this method?
7. Name an event where civil disobedience was used against racial segregation.
8. WhichTemplate is associated with this concept on Wikipedia?
9. Who is known for ideas related to civil disobedience?
10. What term describes refusing to obey unjust laws?

Now, checking each question to ensure they are distinct and cover different facets of the context. Each should have a clear, correct answer from the provided information.

I think these questions meet the requirements: varied topics, relevant to the context, each with a single correct answer. Now, I'll format them into CSV as per the instructions.
