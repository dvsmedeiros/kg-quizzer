Okay, I need to create 10 question-answer pairs based on the provided context and facts about the immune system. Let me start by reading through the context carefully.

The context is quite detailed, covering various aspects of the immune system, including its components like T cells, B cells, dendritic cells, macrophages, natural killer cells, neutrophils, monocytes, and others. It also mentions how the immune system interacts with diseases such as autoimmune disorders, inflammatory bowel disease, multiple sclerosis, HIV/AIDS, and conditions where immunodeficiency occurs.

Now, I'll go through each fact provided in the DBpedia statements to extract relevant information that can be turned into questions.

1. The immune system was first described by Ilya Ilyich Mechnikov in 1882.
   - Question: Who is known as the father of immunology?
   - Answer: Ilya Ilyich Mechnikov

2. Some organisms, like protozoa, can trigger immune responses without a pathogen.
   - Question: What do some organisms that resemble pathogens actually do in an immune response?
   - Answer: They act as non-pathogenic agents.

3. The complement system is part of the innate immune response.
   - Question: Which component of the immune system functions as part of the innate immune response?
   - Answer: Complement

4. Lymphocytes are a type of white blood cell that plays a role in the adaptive immune response.
   - Question: What type of white blood cells are involved in the adaptive immune response?
   - Answer: Lymphocytes

5. The immune system can detect and neutralize parasitic organisms to prevent diseases.
   - Question: How does the immune system combat parasitic organisms?
   - Answer: It detects and neutralizes them.

6. The immune system is essential for preventing infections like viruses, bacteria, and fungi.
   - Question: What systems or defenses protect the body from infections such as viruses, bacteria, and fungi?
   - Answer: The immune system

7. Some immune cells have receptors that recognize specific pathogens.
   - Question: Which type of immune cells use receptors to identify specific pathogen types?
   - Answer: T cells (and others like B cells)

8. The primary immune response is the first defense against an invader.
   - Question: What is the initial immune response to a new pathogen called?
   - Answer: Primary immune response

9. The immune system's adaptability makes it effective over time in recognizing specific pathogens.
   - Question: Why is the immune system considered adaptive and effective for recognizing specific pathogens repeatedly?
   - Answer: Because it becomes more efficient at identifying them over time.

10. The complement system can break down foreign materials, aiding inflammation and tissue damage.
    - Question: What does the complement system in the immune response do to foreign substances?
    - Answer: It breaks them down into harmless components.

I think these 10 questions cover a good range of topics within the immune system based on the provided context. Each question is clear and directly relates to the content, ensuring that each has a single correct answer.
