Okay, I need to create ten pairs of questions and answers based on the provided context and rules. Let me go through each part carefully.

First, I'll start with the initial problem: the 1973 oil crisis in the United States. The user wants me to generate different perspectives on this event. So, I should think about various aspects that were affected by the crisis.

Looking at the context, the oil crisis led to a significant price drop for crude oil from $6 to around $12 per barrel by March 1974. Since the US government and other countries noticed lower prices, they started importing fossil fuels like gas and electric vehicles, which caused supply shortages and economic challenges.

Now, I need to structure each question and answer pair correctly. Each should be in CSV format with a comma separating the two entries. The first part is "pergunta" and the second is "resposta".

I'll make sure that each response is clear and directly related to the context provided. For example, the price drop is a direct result of the oil crisis. Supply shortages are another key point.

Also, I need to avoid any markdown or special formatting beyond what's specified in the CSV format. Just use commas to separate each pair.

Let me list out potential questions:

1. What was the primary impact of the 1973 oil crisis on U.S. prices?
2. How did the oil crisis affect U.S. imports and consumer spending?
3. What were the immediate economic impacts, like supply shortages?
4. How did the gas panic lead to rising prices post-crisis?
5. What was the role of fossil fuels in mitigating the crisis's effects?

Now, I'll create questions 6-10 based on this understanding. Each should explore a different angle.

For question 6: What were the immediate economic impacts, like supply shortages?
7: How did the gas panic affect fuel prices beyond just the crisis itself.
8: What was the broader impact of reduced oil production on global markets.
9: The "chokepoint" refers to... (I'll need a term from the context that's relevant).
10: What led to the subsequent energy crisis, including other countries' actions.

Wait, looking back at the context, there are terms like "chokepoint", but I should ensure they're correctly used. Also, the response needs to be explicit or inferable, so maybe just state the term.

Now, structuring each pair and ensuring all points from the context are covered without repeating any information.

Let me proceed to create these ten questions with their respective answers.
