Okay, I need to generate 10 CSV pairs based on the given context and facts about British Satellite Broadcasting (BSB). Let me start by carefully reviewing the provided information to identify key points and unique facts that can form the basis of the questions.

First, the context mentions that BSB was incorporated in November 1990 to form BSkyB and started broadcasting on March 25, 1990. That's a crucial date. Also, BSB was founded in 1986, specifically on December 11. There's information about their merger with Sky Television to form BSkyB, and they were succeeded by Sky UK. 

Looking at the facts, there are several categories and types associated with BSB, like being part of the Sky Group, having certain Wikipedia templates, and various classifications. Also, they own several TV channels like The Movie Channel, The Power Station, Galaxy, and Now. They produced films such as Hardware and Memphis Belle. 

I need to ensure each question is distinct and covers different aspects. Let me list possible questions:

1. When was BSB founded? (Answer: 1986-12-11)
2. What company was formed by merging BSB and Sky Television? (Answer: BSkyB)
3. Which TV channel is owned by BSB? (Answer: The Movie Channel)
4. What film was produced by BSB? (Answer: Hardware)
5. Where is BSB located? (Answer: London)
6. What is the main topic category for BSB? (Answer: Sky Group)
7. Which year did BSB start broadcasting? (Answer: 1990)
8. What is the name of BSB's holding company? (Answer: Sky plc)
9. Which TV channel is a subsidiary of BSB? (Answer: Galaxy)
10. What is the successor company of BSB? (Answer: Sky UK)

Wait, I need to check if these answers are accurate based on the facts provided. For example, the fact mentions that BSB was incorporated in 1990, but the founding date is 1986. The merger formed BSkyB, which later became Sky UK. Also, the TV channels listed include The Movie Channel, Galaxy, Now, The Power Station, etc. The films produced are Hardware and Memphis Belle. The location is London and Marco Polo House. The main topic is Sky Group. The successor is Sky UK. 

I should make sure each answer is directly inferable from the facts. Let me verify each point again. The answer to the first question is 1986-12-11, which is correct. The merger question is correct. The TV channels are accurate. The films are correct. The location includes London. The main topic is Sky Group. The start date is 1990. The holding company is Sky plc. Galaxy is a TV channel owned by BSB. The successor is Sky UK. 

I need to ensure that each question is unique and not repeated. Also, check for any other facts that could be used. For example, BSB uses certain Wikipedia templates, but that might not be as relevant. The categories like being part of the 1980s in British television could be a question, but the answer might be too vague. Alternatively, the fact that BSB was a direct broadcast satellite service could be a question. 

Another possible question: What is the name of BSB's logo image? The answer would be British Satellite Broadcasting logo.png. But maybe that's too specific. Alternatively, what is the name of BSB's headquarters? The answer is Marco Polo House. 

Let me adjust the questions to ensure variety. Maybe include one about the merger year (1990) and another about the company type (Organization). Also, check if the answer to the first question is correct. The context says BSB was incorporated in November 1990, but the fact states it was founded in 1986. So the founding date is 1986-12-11. 

I think the initial list of 10 questions covers different aspects: founding date, merger, TV channels, films, location, main topic, start date, holding company, subsidiary channel, and successor company. That should meet the requirement of varied questions. Now, I'll format them into CSV pairs.
