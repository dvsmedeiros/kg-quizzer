Okay, so I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs based on the provided data about Fresno, California. Let me first look through the data to understand what's available.

I see that there are various entries mentioning Fresno, including people born or died there, places, and events. For example, Kevin Federline was born in Fresno, as were several other athletes and celebrities. There are also locations like Selland Arena and Warnors Theatre. Additionally, there are mentions of radio stations and courts located in Fresno.

Since the task is to create Q&A pairs, I should focus on facts that can be turned into questions with concise answers. Let me start by identifying key pieces of information:

1. Fresno is a city in California.
2. It's known as the "Orange Blossom Capital."
3. Several people were born there, such as Kevin Federline and Tom Seaver.
4. There are specific locations like Selland Arena and Warnors Theatre.
5. Radio stations KSKS, KRZR, etc., are based there.
6. Fresno is part of the San Joaquin Valley.

I should make sure each question is clear and can be answered directly from the data. Let me draft some questions:

1. What is Fresno's nickname? → "Orange Blossom Capital."
2. Who was born in Fresno and became a famous singer? → Kevin Federline.
3. Where did Tom Seaver, the baseball player, grow up? → Fresno.
4. Which sports arena is in Fresno? → Selland Arena.
5. What radio station broadcasts from Fresno? → KSKS, KRZR, etc.

I need to ensure variety in the questions and cover different aspects of Fresno's data. Also, I should avoid repeating the same answer format too much. Maybe include questions about population density or famous events if available, but looking back, I don't see such details.

Wait, there's a mention of the Big Fresno Fair. That could be another question: What annual event is held in Fresno? → The Big Fresno Fair.

I also see that Fresno has a Metropolitan area with subdivisions. Maybe ask about its metropolitan population or subdivisions, but the data only mentions "Metropolitan Fresno" without specifics. So perhaps better to skip that for now.

Looking again, I can include questions about other notable residents like Kevin Pickford and Richard Miller. Also, places like Kearney Park could be mentioned.

I think I have enough information to create 10 distinct Q&A pairs covering different aspects of Fresno.
