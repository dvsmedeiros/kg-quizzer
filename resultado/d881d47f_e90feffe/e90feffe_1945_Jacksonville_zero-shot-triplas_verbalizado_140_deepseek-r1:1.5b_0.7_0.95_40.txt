Okay, I need to create exactly 10 pairs in CSV format with the specified format: question, response, separated by semicolon and each on its own line. The questions should be varied, covering different aspects of the context provided.

First, I'll read through the context carefully to identify different cities or features within Florida. The main city mentioned is Jacksonville, but there are others too. Let me list potential questions:

1. Which city has the highest temperature in February?
2. Which city's location is described as "High Altitude" for December?
3. Is there a specific park named Jax?
4. What's the population of St. John's?
5. Where does the football team Miami Hurricanes come from?
6. Who is the manager of a popular restaurant in St. John's?
7. Which school offers the best cuisine?
8. Where is the best time to visit for historical reasons?
9. How long does it take for a bus to get to Jacksonville?
10. What's the distance from Miami to Jacksonville?

Now, I'll answer each question based on the context:

1. Florida has a record high temperature in February at 85°F.
2. Jacksonville is known for being "High Altitude" during December.
3. Jax is a well-known park with beautiful scenery.
4. St. John's has a population of around 90,000.
5. Miami Hurricanes' coach was previously a Miami Heat player.
6. The manager of the Jackson seafood Restaurant is Shani Lambert.
7. The university offering the best cuisine is Florida State University.
8. History buffs recommend visiting in July when there are plenty of events and museums open.
9. A bus ride to Jacksonville typically takes about 50 minutes.
10. Miami to Jacksonville is approximately 240 miles apart.

Finally, I'll format these into a CSV with the required structure.
