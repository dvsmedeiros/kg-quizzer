Okay, so I need to create 10 question-response pairs based on the given context about Jacksonville, Florida. The user provided a lot of facts and information, so I'll have to go through them carefully.

First, I'll start by identifying key points from the context. Jacksonville is the most populous city in Florida, with around 950,000 people as of 2020. It's located in Duval County and was founded in 1791 but officially incorporated in 1832. The St. Johns River runs along its margins, and there are beaches nearby.

Looking at the facts, I see a variety of information: population numbers, historical founding, geographical details, events like Super Bowls hosted, notable people from Jacksonville, cultural spots, temperature records, etc.

I'll need to make sure each question is unique and covers different aspects. Let's brainstorm possible questions:

1. **Population**: What is the population rank of Jacksonville in the US?
2. **Year Founded**: When was Jacksonville officially incorporated?
3. **River Location**: Which river flows near Jacksonville?
4. **Super Bowl Host**: In which year did Jacksonville host a Super Bowl?
5. **Founding Figure**: Who is the namesake of Jacksonville?

6. **Historical Colony**: What was the French colony established there in 1564 called?
7. **Native Inhabitants Before Europeans**: Who were the people living there before the French arrived?
8. **Temperature Records**: What's the record high temperature in January for Jacksonville?
9. **Beaches Presence**: Are there beaches near Jacksonville? If so, how are they referred to?
10. **Major Cultural Spot**: What is a well-known cultural spot in Jacksonville?

I'll make sure each question has one correct answer based on the provided data. For example, the population rank is 12th, incorporation year is 1832, and so on.

I should avoid repeating similar questions and ensure the answers are accurate and directly extractable from the context.
