Okay, so I need to generate 10 pairs of questions and answers in CSV format based on the provided context about Normans. The user has given me a specific structure to follow, so I should make sure each entry is exactly two fields separated by a semicolon.

First, I'll start by understanding what the context is about. The context mentions "Normandos," which refers to the Normans, a people of Viking origin who settled in northern France and later conquered England. They had significant impacts on history, including the Norman Conquest of 1066 led by William the Conqueror.

Now, I need to create varied questions that cover different aspects of this topic. Let me brainstorm possible topics: origins, key events like the conquest, important figures, governance changes, and cultural influences.

I'll make sure each question is clear and relates directly to the content. Also, each should have a single correct answer based on what's provided or inferable from it.

1. **Who were the Normans?** - This sets the stage, defining who they are.
2. **Where did the Normans originate?** - Talks about their roots in Scandinavia.
3. **When did Normans invade England?** - Important date for historical context.
4. **What is the significance of 1066?** - Refers to the Norman Conquest led by William the Conqueror.
5. **Who was William the Conqueror?** - Key figure in English history post-conquest.
6. **Which dynasty did Normans establish in England?** - The Plantagenets, though it's a bit of an inference as they came later, but related.
7. **What impact did Normans have on English governance?** - Introduces the feudal system and legal changes.
8. **How did Normans influence the English language?** - Focuses on linguistic contributions through French influences.
9. **What is Domesday Book?** - Important administrative tool introduced by William.
10. **Why were Normans known for castles?** - Their military strategy and architectural impact.

I need to ensure each answer is correct based on historical facts related to the Normans. I should double-check dates, figures, and terms to avoid inaccuracies. For example, making sure that the Plantagenets are correctly associated with the Normans, even though they came later, as they were from the same Norman dynasty.

Also, I need to vary the types of questions: some will be factual (dates, names), others might require a bit more understanding, like their impact on governance or language.

I should avoid repeating similar questions. Each question should target a different aspect, ensuring a broad coverage of the topic.

Now, I'll structure each line as "pergunta;resposta" in Portuguese, making sure the answers are concise and directly related to the context provided.
