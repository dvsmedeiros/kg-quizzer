Okay, I need to generate 10 pairs of questions and answers about prime numbers based on the provided example. Let me look at the examples given to understand how they're structured.

The examples include various aspects of prime numbers: divisors, composite numbers, fundamental theorem, singularidade (uniqueness), primalidade (primality), primality tests like Miller-Rabin and AKS, and a fact about the largest known prime. Each question is followed by a semicolon and then the answer on the same line.

I should create similar questions, making sure they cover different aspects of primes without repeating the ones already in the examples. I'll need to think about definitions, properties, theorems related to primes, methods for testing primality, historical facts, and perhaps some famous conjectures or theorems.

Let me outline possible topics:

1. Types of primes (like twin primes, Mersenne primes)
2. Uses of prime numbers
3. Primes in number theory
4. Distribution of primes
5. Algorithms related to primes
6. Properties of primes
7. Applications of primality tests
8. Historical figures associated with primes
9. Special properties or theorems about primes
10. Records or notable primes

Now, I'll draft questions based on these topics and come up with concise answers.

I need to ensure each question ends with a semicolon and the answer follows immediately after, separated by a semicolon as well.

Let me start drafting:

1. What are twin primes?;Two prime numbers that differ by 2.
2. What is a Mersenne prime?;A prime number that is one less than a power of two.
3. Which conjecture states there are infinitely many primes?;Euclid's theorem.
4. How can primes be used in cryptography?;They form the basis of public-key encryption systems.
5. What is the Sieve of Eratosthenes used for?;To find all prime numbers up to a specified integer.
6. Which property ensures that primes are the building blocks of integers?;The fundamental theorem of arithmetic.
7. Who proved that there are infinitely many primes?;Euclid.
8. What does Fermat's Little Theorem state about primes?;If p is prime and a is not divisible by p, then a^(p-1) ≡ 1 mod p.
9. Which algorithm can factor large primes efficiently?;The Quadratic Sieve or the Elliptic Curve Method (ECM).
10. What is the significance of the number 43 in primality testing history?;It was used by Paul Pritchard to demonstrate early parallel algorithms.

Wait, question 10 might be too specific. Let me think of a more general one instead.

Maybe: What is the smallest prime number?;The smallest prime number is 2.

Alternatively, about the Goldbach conjecture: What famous unsolved problem in number theory involves primes?;Goldbach conjecture states every even integer greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two primes.

But that's a bit long. Let me adjust to keep it concise.

I need to ensure each answer is brief and directly addresses the question without extra details.

Let me adjust:

10. What famous unsolved problem involves primes?;Goldbach conjecture.

That works better.
