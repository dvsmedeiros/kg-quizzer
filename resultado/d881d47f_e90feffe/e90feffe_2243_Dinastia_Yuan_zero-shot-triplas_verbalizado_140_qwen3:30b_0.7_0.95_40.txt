Okay, I need to generate 10 pairs of questions and answers based on the given context and facts about the Yuan Dynasty. Let me start by reviewing the context and facts provided.

The context says the Yuan Dynasty was founded by Kublai Khan, grandson of Genghis Khan, in 1271. The facts list a lot of information, like the capital cities (Shangdu, Khanbaliq), key figures (Kublai Khan, Temür Khan), events (Battle of Xiangyang, Red Turban Rebellion), and various templates and categories related to the dynasty.

First, I should make sure each question is unique and covers different aspects. Let me brainstorm possible questions:

1. **Founding Year**: The context mentions 1271. So a question about when it was founded.
2. **Founder**: Kublai Khan is mentioned as the founder.
3. **Capital Cities**: Shangdu and Khanbaliq are mentioned. Maybe ask about the capital.
4. **End Year**: The dynasty was dissolved in 1368.
5. **Key Events**: Like the Battle of Xiangyang or Red Turban Rebellion.
6. **Cultural Aspects**: The Temple or the use of banknotes.
7. **Geographical Information**: Area statistics or regions under control.
8. **Political Structure**: The use of certain templates or models.
9. **Notable Figures**: Kublai Khan, Temür Khan, etc.
10. **Historical Context**: Preceded by Western Xia, etc.

Now, I need to check the facts to ensure the answers are accurate. For example, the capital is mentioned as Shangdu and Khanbaliq. The end year is 1368. The founder is Kublai Khan. The battle of Xiangyang is listed as related. The use of banknotes is mentioned. The area is 11,000,000.

I need to avoid repeating similar questions. Let me list 10 distinct ones:

1. When was the Yuan Dynasty founded? (Answer: 1271)
2. Who founded the Yuan Dynasty? (Answer: Kublai Khan)
3. What was the capital of the Yuan Dynasty? (Answer: Shangdu and Khanbaliq)
4. In which year was the Yuan Dynasty dissolved? (Answer: 1368)
5. Which battle involved the Yuan Dynasty? (Answer: Battle of Xiangyang)
6. What type of currency did the Yuan Dynasty use? (Answer: Banknote)
7. What is the area statistic of the Yuan Dynasty? (Answer: 11,000,000)
8. Which event marked the end of the Yuan Dynasty? (Answer: Fall of Khanbaliq)
9. Who was a notable leader of the Yuan Dynasty? (Answer: Kublai Khan)
10. What is the alternative name for the Yuan Dynasty? (Answer: Great Yuan State)

Wait, the facts mention "Dai-ön Yeke Mongγol Ulus" as the Mongolian name, but the user might expect the Chinese name. Also, the answer for the capital might need to be both cities. Let me verify the facts again.

Yes, the context says "capital Shangdu" and "capital Khanbaliq". So the answer should include both. Also, the alternative name is "Dai-ön Yeke Mongγol Ulus" but in the facts, there's "nome alternativo Alternative official full name:" which might be "Great Yuan State" as per the image legend. The image legend mentions "Great Yuan State" in Mongolian script. So maybe the answer is "Great Yuan State".

I need to ensure each answer is directly from the context or facts. Let me adjust:

For question 10: "Qual é o nome alternativo da Dinastia Yuan?" Answer: "Great Yuan State" (from the image legend).

Another point: The facts mention "Yuan dynasty possui t 大元大蒙古國" which is "Great Yuan Great Mongol State" in Chinese. But the user might prefer the English translation. However, the answer should be in Portuguese. So "Grande Yuan" or "Grande Mongólia" but the facts say "Great Yuan State" in the image legend. So the answer would be "Grande Yuan" or "Grande Mongólia"? Wait, the original is "Dai-ön Yeke Mongγol Ulus" which is "Great Mongol Empire" in Mongolian, but the Chinese name is "元朝" (Yuan Chao). The alternative name in the facts is "Alternative official full name:" but the actual content isn't provided. However, the image legend says "Yuan dynasty" in Chinese and "Great Yuan State" in Mongolian. So the answer could be "Grande Yuan" (as "Great Yuan" is "Dai Yuan" in Chinese, but the user might need the English translation. But since the answer needs to be in Portuguese, perhaps "Grande Yuan" is acceptable.

I think that's covered. Now, compiling the 10 pairs, ensuring they are varied and correct.
