Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs based on the provided context and facts. Let me start by thoroughly reviewing the context and the facts to ensure I cover all relevant points without repetition.

First, the context mentions the Black Death originated in Central or Eastern Asia, spread via the Silk Road, and was transported by fleas on rats on Genoese merchant ships. The death toll was 75-200 million in Eurasia, 30-60% of Europe's population, and the population took about 200 years to recover, with some areas like Florence recovering in the 19th century. The causes include Yersinia pestis, with bubonic, septicemic, and pneumonic forms. It had religious, social, and economic impacts. It returned in outbreaks until the early 20th century.

Looking at the facts, there's more specific data: 75 million deaths, the name "Black Death," the bacterium Yersinia pestis, the Oriental rat flea as the vector, the spread through the Silk Road, the impact on Europe's population, the recovery time, and some quotes from historical sources.

Now, I need to create varied questions. Let me brainstorm possible topics:

1. Origin of the Black Death.
2. How it spread to Europe.
3. The bacterium responsible.
4. The percentage of Europe's population killed.
5. The time it took for Europe's population to recover.
6. The role of the Oriental rat flea.
7. The total number of deaths estimated.
8. The economic and social effects.
9. The timeline of the Black Death (start and end).
10. The recurrence of the plague until the early 20th century.

I need to ensure each question is unique and directly answerable from the context. Let me check for accuracy and avoid repetition. For example, "origin" and "spread" are different enough. The bacterium and the flea are related but distinct. Population loss percentages and recovery time are separate. The total deaths and the impact on Europe's population are different stats. The economic effects are mentioned in the context. Recurrence is another point. Also, the quote from Geoffrey the Baker could be a question, but the example had a similar one. Wait, the user's example had a question about the origin of the plague, but the user's context says Central or Eastern Asia, so I can use that.

Now, let me form the questions and answers, ensuring they are in Portuguese and follow the CSV format with semicolons. Each answer must be directly from the context or inferable. I need to avoid any markdown and just provide the CSV lines. Let me check each pair for uniqueness and correctness.
