Okay, I need to generate 10 pairs of questions and answers based on the provided context and facts about Ctenophora. Let me start by going through the context and the list of facts to identify key points.

The context mentions that Ctenophora are marine animals with a cosmopolitan distribution, mostly planktonic, some benthic, bioluminescent, and have distinctive "pentes" made of cilia for swimming. They are similar to jellyfish but not closely related. They've been in the fossil record since the Cambrian.

Looking at the facts, there are several attributes: they are of type Thing, EukaryoticCell, Animal, etc. They use various wiki templates, have images, categories, and taxonomic information. Subdivisions like Tentaculata, Nuda, Scleroctenophora are mentioned. Also, they have a species type, common names, and some specific examples.

I need to make sure the questions cover different aspects: taxonomic classification, physical characteristics, biological functions, distribution, historical presence, etc. Also, avoid repeating similar questions. Let me list possible questions:

1. What is the common name for Ctenophora?
2. What is the primary method of movement for Ctenophora?
3. What is the taxonomic classification of Ctenophora?
4. What is the significance of the term "ctenophora" in Greek?
5. What is the size range of Ctenophora?
6. What is the fossil record presence of Ctenophora?
7. What are the main subdivisions of Ctenophora?
8. What is the role of cilia in Ctenophora?
9. What are the common names for Ctenophora?
10. What is the primary use of the "pentes" in Ctenophora?

Now, checking the facts to ensure the answers are correct. For example, the common name is "comb jellies" and the term "ctenophora" comes from Greek. The size range is from 1mm to 1.5m. The subdivisions are Tentaculata, Nuda, Scleroctenophora. The "pentes" are groups of cilia for swimming.

I need to make sure each question is unique and based on the facts. Let me verify each answer against the provided facts. The answer for the taxonomic classification should be "Animal" as per the facts. The answer for the term in Greek is "κτείς kteis 'comb' and φέρω pherō 'carry'". The subdivisions are listed in the facts. The size is mentioned as 1mm to 1.5m. The fossil record is since the Cambrian. The common names include "comb jellies" and "sea gooseberries".

I think that's 10 distinct questions. Now, format them into the CSV format as per the instructions. Ensure that each line is a question followed by the correct answer, separated by a semicolon. No markdown, just the CSV lines.
