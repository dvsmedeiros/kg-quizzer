Okay, I need to generate 10 CSV pairs based on the provided context and facts about the Yuan Dynasty. Let me start by understanding the requirements. The user wants questions and answers in Portuguese, separated by semicolons, with no extra text.

First, I'll look through the context and facts to identify key points. The Yuan Dynasty was founded by Kublai Khan in 1271, part of the Mongol Empire, and it lasted until 1368. It's important to mention its founder, establishment year, capital cities, related events, and key figures like Genghis Khan and Temür Khan. Also, there are mentions of its territories, cultural aspects, and related events like the Mongol conquest of the Song Dynasty and the Red Turban Rebellion.

Now, I need to make sure each question is unique and covers different aspects. Let me list possible questions:

1. Who founded the Yuan Dynasty? (Kublai Khan)
2. When was the Yuan Dynasty established? (1271)
3. What was the capital of the Yuan Dynasty? (Khanbaliq and Shangdu)
4. Who was the avuncular of Kublai Khan? (Genghis Khan)
5. Which dynasty preceded the Yuan Dynasty? (Song Dynasty)
6. Which dynasty succeeded the Yuan Dynasty? (Ming Dynasty)
7. Which event is associated with the Yuan Dynasty's conquest of the Song Dynasty? (Mongol conquest of the Song dynasty)
8. Which rebellion is linked to the Yuan Dynasty's decline? (Red Turban Rebellion)
9. What was the official name of the Yuan Dynasty? (Great Yuan)
10. Which empire was the Yuan Dynasty part of? (Mongol Empire)

I need to check if these answers are explicitly mentioned or can be inferred. For example, the capital cities are mentioned as Khanbaliq and Shangdu. The Red Turban Rebellion is listed as an event related to the Yuan Dynasty. The Mongol Empire is the empire it's part of. The Song Dynasty is mentioned as preceding, and the Ming as succeeding. The official name is "Great Yuan" or "Dà Yuán". 

I should ensure the answers are correctly formatted in Portuguese, using the terms from the context. Also, avoid repeating questions. Let me structure each pair as per the CSV format, making sure the separator is a semicolon and the language is correct.
