Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to generate 10 CSV pairs based on the provided context and facts. The context is about British Satellite Broadcasting (BSB), its merger, and some details about channels and films they produced.

First, I need to parse the context and facts thoroughly. The main points are: BSB was incorporated in November 1990 to form BSkyB, started transmitting in March 1990. The facts mention various categories, templates, ownership of TV channels, films produced, locations, etc.

Now, I need to create questions that cover different aspects. Let's start with the merger. The context says BSB was incorporated in November 1990 to form BSkyB. So a question could be "Qual empresa foi formada após a incorporação da British Satellite Broadcasting em novembro de 1990?" with the answer "British Sky Broadcasting (BSkyB)."

Next, the start date of transmission. The context mentions March 25, 1990. So a question like "Em que data a British Satellite Broadcasting começou a transmitir?" with the answer "25 de março de 1990."

Looking at the facts, there are several TV channels owned by BSB: The Movie Channel, The Power Station, Galaxy, and Now. So a question about the channels could be "Quais canais de TV eram propriedade da British Satellite Broadcasting?" with the answer listing those channels.

Films produced by BSB include Hardware and Memphis Belle. So a question about films: "Quais filmes foram produzidos pela British Satellite Broadcasting?" with the answer listing them.

Location details: BSB was located in London, specifically Marco Polo House. A question about location: "Onde a British Satellite Broadcasting estava localizada?" with the answer "Londres, no Marco Polo House."

The merger details also mention that BSB was succeeded by Sky UK. So a question: "Qual empresa sucedeu a British Satellite Broadcasting?" with the answer "Sky UK."

The year of establishment is 1986. So a question: "Em que ano a British Satellite Broadcasting foi fundada?" with the answer "1986."

Categories mentioned include "1990s in British television" and "Direct broadcast satellite services." A question about categories: "Quais categorias da Wikipedia incluem a British Satellite Broadcasting?" with the answer listing the relevant categories.

Also, BSB used several Wikipedia templates like Template:Infobox company and Template:Reflist. A question about templates: "Quais modelos de página da Wikipedia são usados pela British Satellite Broadcasting?" with the answer listing those templates.

I need to ensure that the questions are varied and not repeating the same information. Let me check for duplicates. The merger and BSkyB have been covered, as well as the start date, channels, films, location, successor, founding year, categories, and templates. That should cover 10 unique questions. Now, I'll format them into CSV as specified, making sure each line has the question and answer separated by a semicolon, in Portuguese.
