Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs about the Scottish Parliament based on the provided data. Let me start by reviewing the information given.

First, the Scottish Parliament was established after a referendum in 1997, and the Scotland Act 1998 defined its powers. The parliament has 129 members, and the current Presiding Officer is Alison Johnstone. The building is in Edinburgh, and the last election was on May 6, 2021. The next election is scheduled for May 7, 2024. The Scottish National Party is the leading party, and Nicola Sturgeon is the First Minister. The committees include Health and Sport, Justice, and others. The parliament has powers in areas like healthcare, education, and local government, but certain powers are reserved for the UK Parliament.

Now, I need to create questions that ask about these points. Let's see:

9. Who is the First Minister of Scotland? Answer: Nicola Sturgeon.
10. What are some of the committees in the Scottish Parliament? Answer: Health and Sport, Justice, Local Government and Communities.

I need to make sure the answers are accurate and match the data provided. Also, the questions should be in Portuguese as per the examples. Let me check if the dates and names are correct. The last election was 2021, next is 2024. Yes, that's correct. The committees listed are from the data. Okay, these should work.
