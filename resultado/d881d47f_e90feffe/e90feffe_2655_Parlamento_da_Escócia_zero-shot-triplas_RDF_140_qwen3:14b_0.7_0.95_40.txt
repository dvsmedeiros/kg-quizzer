Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs based on the provided data about the Scottish Parliament. Let me start by reviewing the data carefully.

First, looking at the data, the Scottish Parliament has several key attributes. The number of members is 129. The leader is Alison Johnstone, and the location is the Scottish Parliament Building in Edinburgh. The last election was on 2021-05-06, and the next election is on 2024-05-07. The political party associated is the Scottish National Party (SNP). The committees include various topics like Health and Sport, Justice, etc. There's also information about the Presiding Officer and the First Minister, with Nicola Sturgeon mentioned as one of the leaders. The building's location is Edinburgh, Scotland, and there are some images linked in the foaf:depiction.

Now, I need to create questions that can be answered using this data. The questions should be in Portuguese, and answers in Portuguese as well, using the information provided. I should avoid using any external knowledge. Let's brainstorm possible questions:

1. How many members does the Scottish Parliament have? Answer: 129.
2. Who is the leader of the Scottish Parliament? Answer: Alison Johnstone.
3. Where is the Scottish Parliament located? Answer: Scottish Parliament Building in Edinburgh.
4. When was the last election for the Scottish Parliament? Answer: 2021-05-06.
5. What is the next election date for the Scottish Parliament? Answer: 2024-05-07.
6. Which political party is associated with the Scottish Parliament? Answer: Scottish National Party.
7. What are some of the committees of the Scottish Parliament? Answer: Health and Sport, Justice, Local Government and Communities, etc.
8. Who is the Presiding Officer of the Scottish Parliament? Answer: Mentioned as one of the leaders, but the data doesn't specify a name. Wait, the data says "ns1:leader <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alison_Johnstone>, <http://dbpedia.org/resource/George_Adam>, <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nicola_Sturgeon>, "--05-08". So Nicola Sturgeon is the First Minister, Alison Johnstone is the Presiding Officer, and George Adam is another leader? Wait, the Presiding Officer is mentioned as a leader, so maybe Alison Johnstone is the Presiding Officer. Also, the data has ns1:leader1Type as Presiding Officer, so Alison Johnstone is the Presiding Officer. So the answer would be Alison Johnstone.
9. What is the name of the building where the Scottish Parliament meets? Answer: Scottish Parliament Building.
10. What are the main areas covered by the committees of the Scottish Parliament? Answer: Health and Sport, Justice, Local Government and Communities, etc.

Wait, I need to make sure each answer is directly from the data. Also, some answers might have multiple parts. Let me check each point again to ensure accuracy and that I'm not adding any information not present in the data.

For example, the leader is listed as Alison Johnstone, George Adam, and Nicola Sturgeon. But the types are: leader1Type is Presiding Officer, leader2Type is First Minister. So Alison Johnstone is the Presiding Officer, Nicola Sturgeon is the First Minister, and George Adam might be another leader, but the data doesn't specify his role. However, the question about the Presiding Officer would be answered by Alison Johnstone.

Another point is the committees listed: "Committee on The Scottish Government's Handling of Harassment Complaints against Former Ministers, Europe and External Relations, Health and Sport, Justice, Local Government and Communities, Procedures, Public Petitions, Scottish Parliamentary Pensions Scheme."

I need to make sure that the questions are clear and concise, and the answers are accurate based on the provided data. Let me structure the 10 pairs now.
