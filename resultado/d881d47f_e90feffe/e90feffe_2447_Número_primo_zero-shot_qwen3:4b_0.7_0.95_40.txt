Okay, the user wants me to generate 10 objective questions and answers in CSV format based on the context provided, which is "Número_primo" (which I assume is "Prime Number" in Portuguese). Let me start by recalling what I know about prime numbers.

First, I need to make sure that each question is unique and covers different aspects. Let me brainstorm possible topics: definitions, examples, properties, how to check if a number is prime, historical context, applications, etc.

For the first question, a basic definition would be good. Then, an example of a prime number. Next, maybe a non-prime number to differentiate. Then, properties like having exactly two distinct factors. Also, the smallest prime number is 2, which is important. Then, the largest known prime number, but I should check if that's accurate. Wait, the largest known prime is a Mersenne prime, but the user might not expect that. Maybe they just want a general fact.

Another point is that 1 is not a prime number. So a question about that. Also, the Sieve of Eratosthenes is a method to find primes, so that's a good question. Then, the number of prime numbers below 10. And maybe the number of prime numbers between 1 and 10. Wait, that's similar, so I need to vary them.

Also, the fact that even numbers greater than 2 are not prime. So a question about that. Then, the sum of all prime numbers up to 10. And perhaps a question about how many primes are there below 20. 

Wait, let me check if I have 10 distinct questions. Let me list them:

1. Definition of a prime number.
2. Example of a prime number.
3. Non-prime example.
4. Properties (exactly two factors).
5. Smallest prime.
6. Largest known prime (maybe Mersenne, but maybe the user wants a simpler answer).
7. 1 is not prime.
8. Sieve of Eratosthenes.
9. Number of primes below 10.
10. Even numbers and primality.

Wait, but the user might not want the largest known prime, since that's a very specific and current fact. Maybe they just want the fact that 2 is the only even prime. Alternatively, maybe the user expects a more general answer. Let me think.

Alternatively, the question about the largest prime number could be answered with "there is no largest prime number," since primes are infinite. But I need to check if that's correct. Yes, Euclid proved that there are infinitely many primes. So that's a good question.

But the user might not want that. Let me make sure each question is based on the provided context. Since the context is "Número_primo", which is Portuguese for "prime number", the user might have provided some specific information, but since the user hasn't given any specific text, I have to rely on general knowledge. However, the user said to generate based on the context provided, which is just "Número_primo". So maybe the user expects a list of questions related to the general concept of prime numbers.

So I'll proceed with the 10 questions as I listed, making sure they are varied and correct. Let me structure them into CSV format, ensuring each line is a question and answer separated by a semicolon, and in Portuguese. Also, check that the answers are correct and based on general knowledge of prime numbers.
