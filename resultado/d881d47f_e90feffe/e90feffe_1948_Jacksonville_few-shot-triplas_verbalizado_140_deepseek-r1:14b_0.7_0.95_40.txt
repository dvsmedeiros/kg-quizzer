Okay, I need to create 10 pairs of questions and answers based on the provided context about Jacksonville, Florida. The user has given specific instructions to follow, so I'll start by carefully reading through all the information.

First, I notice that Jacksonville is the most populous city in Florida, located in Duval County. It's also the third largest on the East Coast after NYC and Philly, and the 12th in the U.S. with a population of nearly 950k as per the 2020 census. It was founded in 1791 and incorporated in 1832.

Looking at the facts, there's a lot about sports teams based in Jacksonville, like the Jaguars football team, various basketball teams from different universities, and some details about events like the Super Bowl held there in 2005. There are also mentions of people born or who have died in Jacksonville, along with some infrastructure and historical sites.

I need to generate varied questions covering different aspects: population stats, history, geography, sports, notable people, etc. Each question must have a single correct answer from the provided context.

Let me list possible topics:

1. Population and ranking
2. Founding and incorporation dates
3. Geography (river, distance to other cities)
4. Historical facts (colonization, Fort Caroline)
5. Sports teams and events (Super Bowl location)
6. Notable people born or deceased there

Now, I'll create questions for each category:

1. What is Jacksonville's population rank in the U.S.? - 12th
2. When was Jacksonville incorporated? - February 9, 1832
3. Which river flows through it? - St. Johns River
4. What was the first European settlement? - Fort Caroline
5. Who were the original inhabitants? - Timucua people
6. Where is the Super Bowl held in 2005? - EverBank Field, Jacksonville
7. Name a sports team based there (maybe Jaguars)
8. Notable person born there (e.g., Christian Gaddis)
9. What's the highest temperature recorded in January? - 85°F
10. Which highway ends in Jacksonville? - Florida State Road 9B

Wait, I need to make sure each question is unique and not too similar. Let me adjust some to cover more topics.

Looking back at the context, there are multiple entries about sports teams from different universities, so perhaps one question can ask for a specific team's name, another about events hosted, etc.

Also, there's information about temperature records in January and October, which could form a good question.

I should structure each CSV line as "pergunta;resposta" without any extra text. Let me make sure I don't repeat similar questions and cover the range of topics provided.
