Okay, so I need to generate 10 pairs of Portuguese questions and answers based on the given context about British Satellite Broadcasting (BSB). The output should be in CSV format with each line containing a question followed by the correct answer separated by a semicolon.

First, I'll go through the context provided. BSB was a UK-based TV company that started broadcasting on March 25, 1990, and later merged with Sky Television to form BSkyB in November 1990. It was established in 1986 and is related to various TV channels like The Movie Channel, Power Station, Galaxy, etc.

From the facts section, I see details about BSB's establishment year, location, merger, ownership of certain TV channels, production of films, and other classifications.

Now, I need to create varied questions that cover different aspects. Let me list down potential topics:

1. Year BSB was founded
2. Date when it started broadcasting
3. Name of the company after merger
4. Owner of specific TV channels (e.g., The Movie Channel)
5. Production involvement in films
6. Location of BSB's headquarters
7. Merged with which company
8. Type of entity or industry
9. Year it merged to form BSkyB
10. Date of incorporation leading to merger

I should ensure each question is unique and covers different facts without repeating similar questions.

Let me draft the first few:

- Q: Em que ano a BSB foi fundada? Resposta: 1986
- Q: Qual é o nome da empresa resultante após a fusão? Resposta: BSkyB
- Q: Quem era o dono do Canal The Movie Channel? Resposta: BSB

Continuing this way, I'll check each fact to make sure all aspects are covered and that there's no repetition.
