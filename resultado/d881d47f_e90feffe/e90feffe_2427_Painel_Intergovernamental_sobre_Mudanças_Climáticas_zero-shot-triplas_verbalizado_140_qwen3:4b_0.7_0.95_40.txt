Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the provided context and facts. Let me start by understanding the context and the facts given.

The context talks about the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change), its establishment in 1988, its role in synthesizing climate change knowledge, its structure, and its Nobel Peace Prize in 2007. The facts include various attributes like its headquarters in Geneva, its association with the UN, WMO, and UNEP, its working groups, and some key people involved.

Now, I need to create questions that are varied and cover different aspects. Let's list possible topics: establishment year, headquarters, associated organizations, Nobel Prize, working groups, key people, types of organizations, etc.

I should ensure that each question is unique and based on the facts. For example, one question could be about the headquarters, another about the Nobel Prize, another about the associated organizations, and so on. I need to avoid repeating similar questions.

Let me check the facts again to make sure I don't miss any important points. The facts mention the Nobel Prize in 2007, the headquarters in Geneva, the associated organizations (WMO, UNEP), the working groups, the abbreviation IPCC, the types of organizations (e.g., WikicatClimateChangeOrganizations), and the main topic (climate change).

I need to make sure each answer is directly from the facts. For example, the answer to the question about the headquarters is Geneva, Switzerland. The answer for the Nobel Prize is 2007. The associated organizations include WMO and UNEP.

I should also check that the questions are in Portuguese and the answers are accurate. Let me start drafting the questions and answers, making sure they are distinct and cover different aspects as per the facts.
