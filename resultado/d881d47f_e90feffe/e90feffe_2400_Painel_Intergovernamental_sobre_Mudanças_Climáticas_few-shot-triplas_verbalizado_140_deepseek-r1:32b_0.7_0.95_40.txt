Okay, so I need to generate 10 question and answer pairs based on the provided context about the IPCC. The questions should be in Portuguese, each followed by a semicolon and the correct answer. They have to cover different aspects of the content without repeating similar questions.

First, looking at the context, it mentions that the IPCC was created in 1988 under the United Nations (ONU) by UNEP and WMO. That's a good starting point for a question about its creation year.

Next, the context states that the IPCC's main goal is to synthesize and disseminate advanced knowledge on climate change, especially global warming. So another question could be about its primary objective.

The acronym IPCC stands for Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which I can make into a question about what the acronym stands for.

It also mentions that the IPCC has produced five major reports since its inception, with the first in 1990 and the last in 2014. That's useful for a question about the number of reports.

The headquarters are in Geneva, Switzerland, which can be another question asking where it's located.

In 2007, the IPCC won the Nobel Peace Prize due to its rigorous work involving thousands of top scientists. So a question about the award it received makes sense.

Hoesung Lee is the current chair or president of the IPCC, so asking who leads it would be relevant.

The IPCC doesn't conduct original research but compiles and summarizes existing studies by leading scientists. That's another good point for a question about its method.

It's recognized as the world authority on global warming, serving as the main basis for international and national climate policies. A question about its role or recognition fits here.

Lastly, mentioning that despite its authoritative status, it still faces criticism can form a question about whether it receives critiques.

I need to ensure each question is unique and covers different aspects like creation, objectives, structure, achievements, leadership, methodology, and reception.
