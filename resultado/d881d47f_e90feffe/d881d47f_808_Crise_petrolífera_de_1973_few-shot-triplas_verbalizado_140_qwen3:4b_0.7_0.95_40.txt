Okay, the user wants me to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the provided context and facts about the 1973 oil crisis. Let me start by carefully reading through the context and facts to make sure I understand all the key points.

First, the context mentions that the crisis began in October 1973 when OPEC members imposed an oil embargo on countries supporting Israel during the Yom Kippur War. The embargo affected countries like Canada, Japan, the Netherlands, the UK, and the US, later expanding to Portugal, Rhodesia, and South Africa. The oil price rose from $3 to $12 per barrel, with higher prices in the US. It's called the "first oil shock," followed by the 1979 crisis as the "second oil shock."

Looking at the facts, there are various categories and tags, but the main points are the start date, the embargo, the countries involved, the price increase, the name of the crisis, and its effects. The user provided examples of questions, so I need to ensure my questions are varied and cover different aspects without repetition.

I should avoid repeating the same type of question, like asking about the start date multiple times. Instead, I can ask about the reason for the embargo, the countries affected, the price change, the name of the crisis, the expansion of the embargo, the economic impact, the duration, and the consequences. Also, the examples include questions about the price, the countries, the name, the embargo's reason, and the outcome of negotiations.

I need to check if the facts mention specific details that can be turned into questions. For example, the price went from $3 to $12, so a question about the price increase. The embargo started in October 1973 but ended in March 1974. The crisis is called the "first oil shock," so that's a term to include. The countries involved in the embargo are listed, so a question about which countries were affected.

I also need to ensure that the answers are directly from the context. For example, the embargo was directed at countries supporting Israel, so that's a correct answer. The price in the US was higher, so that's a fact. The expansion of the embargo to other countries is mentioned, so that's another point.

I should make sure each question is unique and covers different aspects: the start date, the reason, the countries involved, the price change, the name of the crisis, the duration, the expansion of the embargo, the economic impact, the outcome of negotiations, and the consequences.

Now, I need to structure these into 10 distinct questions with correct answers. Let me list them out:

1. When did the 1973 oil crisis start? (October 1973)
2. What was the reason for the oil embargo? (Supporting Israel during the Yom Kippur War)
3. Which countries were initially targeted by the embargo? (Canada, Japan, Netherlands, UK, US)
4. What was the price of oil in March 1974? (US$12 per barrel)
5. What is another term for the 1973 oil crisis? (First oil shock)
6. Which countries were added to the embargo later? (Portugal, Rhodesia, South Africa)
7. What was the economic impact of the embargo? (Oil price increase, leading to economic crises)
8. When did the embargo end? (March 1974)
9. What was the outcome of Nixon's negotiations? (Israel withdrew from Sinai and Golan)
10. What was the name of the 1979 crisis? (Second oil shock)

Wait, the user's example includes a question about when the second oil shock happened, so maybe I should include that as well. Let me check the facts again. The context says the 1973 crisis was followed by the 1979 crisis as the second oil shock. So the answer to that question would be 1979.

But I need to make sure the questions are all different. The user's example includes questions about the start date, price, name of the crisis, countries involved, the reason, the expansion, the duration, the outcome of negotiations, and the second shock. So I should cover those aspects.

I need to ensure that each question is unique and that the answers are accurate based on the provided context. Also, the user's example includes a question about the expansion of the embargo, so that's a good point to include.

Let me verify each answer against the context to make sure they are correct. For example, the price went from $3 to $12, so that's correct. The embargo started in October 1973 but ended in March 1974. The second oil shock is in 1979.

I think that's all. Now, I can structure these into the CSV format as specified, making sure each pair is separated by a semicolon and in the correct order.
