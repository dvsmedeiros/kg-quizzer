Okay, the user wants me to generate 10 pairs of questions and answers in CSV format based on the provided context and facts about the Yuan dynasty. Let me start by understanding the requirements.

First, I need to make sure each question is unique and covers different aspects. The context mentions the Yuan dynasty was founded by Kublai Khan, its start in 1271, and its end in 1368. There are also mentions of key events, people, and related entities like the Song dynasty, the Mongol Empire, and events like the Red Turban Rebellion.

Looking at the facts, there are a lot of details about the dynasty's establishment, key figures, events, and related topics. I need to extract 10 distinct questions. Let me list out possible topics: founding date, founder, successor, related events, other dynasties, key people, events, and maybe some specific terms or terms related to the dynasty.

I should avoid repeating the same type of question. For example, the user already has questions about the founder, start date, and successor. So I need to come up with new ones. Let's see:

1. What is the name of the dynasty in Chinese?
2. What is the official name of the dynasty?
3. Who was the founder?
4. When was the dynasty established?
5. What event is associated with the end of the dynasty?
6. Which dynasty preceded the Yuan?
7. Which dynasty followed the Yuan?
8. Who was the grandfather of Kublai Khan?
9. What was the name of the capital city?
10. What was the name of the calendar used during the dynasty?

Wait, but the user's example includes questions about the official name, founder, start date, and successor. So I need to ensure that the new questions are different. Let me check the facts again to see what else is there.

The facts mention the Red Turban Rebellion, the Mongol conquest of the Song dynasty, the Battle of Xiangyang, the Battle of Pagan, and others. Also, there are mentions of the capital being Khanbaliq, the use of the "Great Yuan" name, and the establishment of the dynasty in 1271.

Also, the dynasty is part of the Mongol Empire, and it's related to the Song dynasty. The user's example has a question about which dynasty came after the Yuan, so I can use that. Also, the dynasty ended in 1368, so that's a point.

Let me structure the questions:

1. What is the Chinese name for the Yuan dynasty?
2. What was the official name of the Yuan dynasty?
3. Who was the founder of the Yuan dynasty?
4. In what year was the Yuan dynasty established?
5. What significant event marked the end of the Yuan dynasty?
6. Which dynasty preceded the Yuan dynasty?
7. Which dynasty followed the Yuan dynasty?
8. Who was the grandfather of Kublai Khan?
9. What was the name of the capital of the Yuan dynasty?
10. What was the name of the calendar used during the Yuan dynasty?

Now, check if these are all covered in the facts. The Chinese name is "Yuan cháo" (元朝). The official name is "Great Yuan" (大元). The founder is Kublai Khan. Established in 1271. End of the dynasty is 1368. The preceding dynasty is Song, following is Ming. Kublai's grandfather is Genghis Khan. Capital was Khanbaliq. The calendar is "Time Granting Calendar" (Time Granting Calendar).

Yes, these are all in the provided facts. Now, I need to make sure that the answers are accurate and directly from the context. Also, check for any possible duplicates or similar questions. The user's example already includes some of these, but since the user wants 10 pairs, I need to ensure they are all different and cover different aspects.

So, the final CSV should have these 10 pairs. Let me format them correctly with the semicolons and without any extra text.
