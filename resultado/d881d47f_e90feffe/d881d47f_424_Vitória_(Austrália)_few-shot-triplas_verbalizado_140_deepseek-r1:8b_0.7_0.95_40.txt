Okay, I need to generate 10 question-response pairs based on the given context about Victoria, Australia. The questions should be varied and cover different aspects of Victoria. Let me go through the facts provided and think about what kinds of questions can be asked.

First, looking at the context, Victoria is known for its diverse economy, so maybe a question about that. Also, it's the second most populous state after New South Wales and the most densely populated. So I can ask about this ranking.

The capital esportiva da Austrália é Melbourne, so that's another point to cover. There are mentions of various places like Bendigo, Ballarat, etc., so a question about regions with significant Asian influence could be good.

Melbourne has landmarks such as the MCG and Melbourne Park hosting major events. The Great Victorian Bike Ride is a significant event, so that's another angle.

Geographical aspects: Victoria has coastlines on Bass Strait and the Tasman Sea, borders with New South Wales, etc. The state's history includes being part of New South Wales until 1851, so a question about its historical background could be relevant.

Melbourne was the federal capital until 1927, so that's another fact to include. Population density is mentioned as 28/km², which can be a question.

Cultural aspects: Melbourne has museums and galleries, and Victoria itself is known for cultural events. The presence of universities like Melbourne University adds educational significance.

Sports events, like the Australian Open, are hosted there, so that's another point. Historical figures like Charles McDowall and John Siddons can be the subjects of questions about their contributions.

I need to make sure each question is unique and covers different aspects without repeating topics. Let me list out possible questions based on these thoughts.
