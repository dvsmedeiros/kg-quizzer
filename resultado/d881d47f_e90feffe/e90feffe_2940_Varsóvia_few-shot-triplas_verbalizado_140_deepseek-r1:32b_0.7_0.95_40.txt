Okay, so I need to create 10 question and answer pairs based on the provided context about Warsaw. Let me start by reading through the context carefully to understand the key points.

First, it mentions that Warsaw is the capital of Poland and the largest city there. It's located along the Vistula River, about 260 km from the Baltic Sea and 300 km from the Carpathian Mountains. The population in 2012 was around 1.7 million people. 

Warsaw has a rich industrial base with various sectors like consumer goods, steel, electrical engineering, and automotive industries. There are several universities and other educational institutions there, making it an important academic hub. It's also home to cultural landmarks like the National Opera and a major theater.

Historically, Warsaw dates back to the late 13th century as a small fishing village. In 1569, King Sigismund III moved the capital from Kraków to Warsaw. Before World War II, it was known as "Paris of the North" but suffered severe damage during the war. Afterward, it was rebuilt, earning the nickname "Phoenix City."

In terms of quality of life, in 2012, The Economist ranked Warsaw as the 32nd most livable city globally. It's also a dynamic metropolitan area and an economic and cultural hub in Europe.

Looking at the facts provided, there are several individuals born or died in Warsaw, various institutions located there, sports events, and other landmarks. 

Now, I need to create varied questions that cover different aspects of Warsaw—geography, history, economy, education, culture, etc. Each question should have a clear answer from the context.

Let me start brainstorming some topics:

1. Geography: Rivers, distance from the sea.
2. Population statistics.
3. Economy and industry sectors.
4. Education institutions.
5. Cultural landmarks like Sigismund's Column.
6. Historical events, especially related to World War II.
7. Post-war reconstruction nickname.
8. Quality of life rankings.
9. Economic status as a financial hub.
10. UNESCO heritage sites.

I should ensure each question is unique and covers different areas without repetition. Let me draft some questions:

1. What river flows through Warsaw? (Answer: Vistula)
2. How far is Warsaw from the Baltic Sea? (Answer: ~260 km)
3. What was Warsaw's population in 2012? (~1.7 million)
4. Name a major industry in Warsaw. (e.g., automotive)
5. Which university is located in Warsaw? (University of Warsaw)
6. Where is Sigismund's Column situated? (Warsaw)

8. What was Warsaw's nickname before WWII? ("Paris of the North")
9. Why is Warsaw called "Phoenix City"? (Reconstruction post-WWII)
