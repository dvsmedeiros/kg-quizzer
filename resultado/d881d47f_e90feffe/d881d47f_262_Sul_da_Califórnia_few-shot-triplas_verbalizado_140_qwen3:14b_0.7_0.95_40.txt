Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the provided context and facts. Let's start by understanding the context and facts given.

The context talks about Southern California (SoCal), describing it as the informal name for the third part of California. It mentions that there are no exact borders, and the population in 2019 was around 23.8 million.

- Earthquakes affecting the region (e.g., 1994 Northridge earthquake).
- Images and maps associated with Southern California.
