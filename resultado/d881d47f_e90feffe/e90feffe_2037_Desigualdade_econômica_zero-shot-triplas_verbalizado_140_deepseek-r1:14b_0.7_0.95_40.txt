Okay, so I need to create a CSV file with exactly 10 pairs of questions and answers based on the given context about economic inequality. Let me start by carefully reading through the context and facts provided.

First, the context explains that economic inequality refers to the distribution of wealth and income among people and countries. It mentions different types like Gini coefficient and HDI adjusted for inequality. The facts include various models used in a Wikipedia page, images, related categories, and notable figures like Branko Milanović and Robert Wade.

Now, I need to generate varied questions that cover different aspects of the content without repeating similar ones. Each question should have one correct answer based on the provided information.

1. **What metric is widely used to measure economic inequality?** The context mentions the Gini coefficient as the most used, so that's a direct answer.
2. **Which index considers inequality in human development?** It refers to the HDI adjusted for inequality, so that should be the answer.
3. **Name an author associated with economic inequality research.** Branko Milanović is mentioned, making him a good choice.
4. **What's a term related to wealth distribution differences?** The context uses "wealth disparity," which fits.
5. **Which Occupy movement focused on economic issues in Atlanta?** It's Occupy Atlanta, as stated in the facts.
6. **What book by Thomas Piketty discusses inequality?** Capital in the Twenty-First Century is a well-known work.
7. **Name a think tank addressing economic inequality.** Nathan Cummings Foundation is listed under focus areas.
8. **What graph type shows income distribution changes over time?** The Kuznets curve is mentioned, so that's it.
9. **Which film deals with wealth disparity issues?** The context doesn't specify a film, but I might need to infer or check if any are listed. Alternatively, maybe "The Hidden Wealth of Nations" is a book, not a film. Perhaps the user expects another example, but since it's not provided, I'll proceed as per available info.
10. **What concept refers to fair distribution in terms of opportunities?** The context mentions equality of opportunities.

Wait, for question 9, the facts mention "The Rich and the Rest of Us" as a non-fiction work on economic inequality, but it's a book, not a film. Since there's no movie listed, I might have made an error here. Let me reconsider: perhaps use another aspect, like a model or index instead.

Alternatively, since the user didn't provide a specific film, maybe I should avoid that and focus on other aspects. Maybe something about models used in Wikipedia pages? But the instruction is to create varied questions across different aspects.

Let me adjust question 9 to be about a book instead. So:

9. **Name a non-fiction work addressing economic inequality.** "Capital and Ideology" by Thomas Piketty is mentioned, so that works.

Wait, but earlier I used Piketty for question 6. Maybe vary it more. Alternatively, use another book from the facts: "The Hidden Wealth of Nations." But since it's not as well-known, perhaps using Piketty again is acceptable if necessary.

Alternatively, another approach could be to ask about a scholar instead, but that might overlap with earlier questions.

Wait, looking back, I have:

6. **What major book by Thomas Piketty discusses economic inequality?** Answer: Capital in the Twenty-First Century

9. Maybe change it to something else, like "Name an area where global inequality has decreased." The answer would be between nations due to globalization.

But the context says that globalization reduced global inequality but increased within countries. So:

9. **What effect does globalization have on global inequality?** Answer: Reduction (or Decrease)

Wait, no, the context says it's reduced global inequality between nations but increased within countries. So perhaps a better question could be about that.

Alternatively, to keep it focused on types of content, maybe ask about an economist or another model.

Alternatively, since I have limited information about movies, perhaps it's better to adjust the ninth question to focus on another aspect, such as models or indices.

Let me try:

9. **What does the Gini coefficient measure?** Answer: Economic inequality

But that might be too direct and similar to question 1. Alternatively, think of another angle.

Wait, maybe I should check all facts again for any film. The facts mention "The Rich and the Rest of Us" as a non-fiction work, but it's a book. So perhaps there's no movie listed in the facts. Therefore, I might need to adjust question 9 to something else.

Let me revise:

9. **What concept focuses on fair opportunities rather than outcomes?** Answer: Equality of opportunity

But that's similar to question 10. Alternatively, maybe ask about a model used in Wikipedia pages, like Template:Cite journal or Template:Reflist. But perhaps it's too specific.

Alternatively, since the user provided multiple images as facts, I can create a question about one of them:

9. **What image represents wealth distribution globally?** Answer: Global Wealth Distribution 2020 (Property).svg

That could work.
