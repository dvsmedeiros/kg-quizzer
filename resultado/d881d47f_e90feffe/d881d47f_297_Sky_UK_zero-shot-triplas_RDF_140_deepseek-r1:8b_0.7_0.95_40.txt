Okay, I need to create 10 question-response pairs based on the given context about British Satellite Broadcasting (BSB). Let me go through the facts and context carefully.

First, the context mentions that BSB was incorporated in November 1990 to form BskyB and started transmitting on March 25, 1990. So I can ask a question about the founding date or the year it started operating.

Looking at the facts, several TV channels like Galaxy, Now, The Movie Channel, etc., were owned by BSB. I can create questions about these specific channels to test knowledge of ownership.

The context also states that BSB was merged with Sky Television to form BSkyB. So a question about the merger would be relevant.

There's information about the company being established in 1986, so a question regarding its year of establishment makes sense.

Location details include London, England, and Marco Polo House, which can be another question.

The successor company is Sky UK, which is important to include as a question.

There are facts about various films produced by BSB, such as "Hardware" and "Heil Honey I'm Home!", so questions about those productions would be good.

Additionally, the logo and pictures associated with BSB can form another question.

I need to ensure each question is unique and covers different aspects: ownership of channels, founding date, merger information, establishment year, locations, successor company, film production, and media presence through logos and images.

Let me structure these into 10 clear questions. I'll make sure the answers are directly extracted from the provided context without adding any extra information.
