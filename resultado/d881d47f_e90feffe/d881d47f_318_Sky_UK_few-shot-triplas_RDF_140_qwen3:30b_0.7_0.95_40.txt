Okay, I need to generate 10 pairs of questions and answers in Portuguese based on the given context and facts. Let me start by understanding the context provided.

The context says that British Satellite Broadcasting (BSB) was a company based in London that provided satellite TV services in the UK. It was incorporated in November 1990 to form British Sky Broadcasting (BSkyB). BSB started transmitting on March 25, 1990. 

The facts are in RDF format, which includes various resources and their relationships. For example, several TV channels and films are linked to BSB as their owner or production company. Also, BSB's details like founding date, location, and successor are mentioned.

Now, I need to create 10 unique questions and answers. Each question should be relevant, varied, and based on the given info. Let me list possible aspects:

1. **Incorporation and merger**: When was BSB incorporated? What happened to it?
2. **Founding and start date**: When was BSB established? When did it start broadcasting?
3. **Location**: Where was BSB based?
4. **Successor company**: What company succeeded BSB?
5. **TV channels and content**: Which channels or productions were associated with BSB?
6. **Facts from RDF**: Specific data points like founding year, locations, categories, etc.

Let me check the facts again. The founding date is 1986-12-11, founding year 1986. The successor is Sky UK. Locations include London, England, etc. There are several TV channels like Galaxy, Now, The Computer Channel, etc., linked to BSB.

Potential questions:

1. When was British Satellite Broadcasting incorporated? (Answer: November 1990)
2. When did BSB start transmitting? (Answer: March 25, 1990)
3. What is the successor company of BSB? (Answer: Sky UK)
4. What was the founding year of BSB? (Answer: 1986)
5. In which city was BSB based? (Answer: London)
6. Which TV channel was owned by BSB? (Answer: Galaxy)
7. What type of services did BSB provide? (Answer: Satellite TV services)
8. What category does BSB fall under? (Answer: Company)
9. What is the name of the company's holding? (Answer: Sky plc)
10. Which films were produced by BSB? (Answer: Memphis Belle, Heil Honey I'm Home!)

Wait, the RDF mentions specific channels and films. For example, Galaxy, Now, The Computer Channel, etc. Also, films like Memphis Belle and Heil Honey I'm Home! are linked. So questions about specific channels or productions.

Need to ensure that answers are directly from the context. For example, the successor is Sky UK, not BSkyB. Wait, the context says BSB was incorporated into BSkyB in November 1990. But the RDF says the successor is Sky UK. Need to check that.

In the context: "A empresa foi incorporada pela em novembro de 1990 para formar a British Sky Broadcasting (BSkyB)." So the successor is BSkyB, but in the RDF, the successor is Sky UK. Maybe there's a discrepancy. But the user's context says BSkyB, so I should use that. However, the facts might have different info. Need to check.

Looking at the facts: "ns2:successor <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sky_UK>". So according to the facts, the successor is Sky UK. But the context says it was incorporated into BSkyB. This could be conflicting. Which one to use? The user's instruction says to generate based on the context and facts provided. So if the facts say Sky UK, but the context says BSkyB, which is correct?

Wait, the user's context says: "A empresa foi incorporada pela em novembro de 1990 para formar a British Sky Broadcasting (BSkyB)." So the incorporation formed BSkyB, which might be the same as Sky UK. Maybe BSkyB is the same as Sky UK. So the answer could be either, but need to stick to the facts.

Alternatively, maybe the facts have Sky UK as the successor, but the context says BSkyB. This might be a data inconsistency, but the user wants answers based on the given context and facts. So if the facts mention Sky UK as successor, then answer that. But the context says it was incorporated into BSkyB. So perhaps the correct answer is BSkyB, but the facts say Sky UK. Need to check.

Alternatively, maybe the user's context is more accurate. Since the user provided the context as part of the input, I should prioritize that. So the answer to the successor would be BSkyB, not Sky UK. But the facts have Sky UK. Hmm. This is a bit confusing. The user might have conflicting data, but I have to go with what's in the context and facts. Since the context explicitly says it was incorporated into BSkyB, that's the answer.

So for the question about the successor, answer is British Sky Broadcasting (BSkyB). But the facts say Sky UK. Maybe the answer should be Sky UK as per the facts. But the user's context says BSkyB. This is conflicting. Need to check the exact wording.

The context says: "A empresa foi incorporada pela em novembro de 1990 para formar a British Sky Broadcasting (BSkyB)." So the successor is BSkyB. The facts have "ns2:successor <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sky_UK>". So perhaps Sky UK is the successor, but the user's context says BSkyB. Which one to use? Since the user provided both, but the instructions say to use the context and facts. So if the facts have Sky UK, maybe that's the answer. However, the context says BSkyB. This is a problem. Maybe the correct answer is BSkyB as per the context. Alternatively, the user's context might have a typo. But I have to follow the given data.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is BSkyB, and the facts' Sky UK is a different entity. Without more info, I'll stick with the context's statement that it was incorporated into BSkyB. So the successor is BSkyB.

Another point: The user's examples have answers like "BSkyB" and "Sky UK Limited". So maybe the answer here is Sky UK. But the context says BSkyB. This is a conflict. But the user might have provided conflicting data. However, the user's instruction says to generate based on the context and facts. So if the facts say Sky UK, that's the answer.

This is a bit tricky, but I'll proceed with the facts as per the RDF data.

So, to sum up, the possible questions and answers:

1. Quando a British Satellite Broadcasting foi incorporada? (Resposta: Novembro de 1990)
2. Quando a BSB começou a transmitir? (Resposta: 25 de março de 1990)
3. Qual é a empresa sucessora da BSB? (Resposta: Sky UK)
4. Qual foi o ano de fundação da BSB? (Resposta: 1986)
5. Em qual cidade a BSB estava localizada? (Resposta: Londres)
6. Qual canal de televisão era proprietário da BSB? (Resposta: Galaxy)
7. Quais serviços a BSB fornecia? (Resposta: Serviços de televisão por satélite)
8. Qual é o nome da holding da BSB? (Resposta: Sky plc)
9. Quais filmes foram produzidos pela BSB? (Resposta: Memphis Belle, Heil Honey I'm Home!)
10. Quais categorias a BSB está relacionada? (Resposta: Companhia)

Wait, the facts have "ns3:hypernym <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Company>", so the category is "Company". Also, the "década" (decade) might be 1980s, but the founding year is 1986. But the user's examples have answers like "BSkyB" and "Sky UK Limited", so I need to make sure the answers are precise.

Also, the RDF mentions "ns3:hypernym" as "Company", so the category is "Company".

Another point: The user's examples have answers like "BSkyB" and "Sky UK Limited", so maybe the answer for successor is "BSkyB" as per the context. But the facts say "Sky UK". This is conflicting. Since the user's context is explicit, I'll go with that.

So finalizing the 10 pairs:

1. Quando a British Satellite Broadcasting foi incorporada para formar a British Sky Broadcasting?;Novembro de 1990
2. Em que data a BSB começou a transmitir?;25 de março de 1990
3. Qual é a empresa sucessora da British Satellite Broadcasting?;British Sky Broadcasting (BSkyB)
4. Qual foi o ano de fundação da BSB?;1986
5. Em qual cidade a BSB estava localizada?;Londres
6. Qual canal de televisão era propriedade da BSB?;Galaxy
7. Quais serviços a BSB oferecia?;Serviços de televisão por satélite
8. Qual é o nome da holding da BSB?;Sky plc
9. Quais filmes foram produzidos pela BSB?;Memphis Belle, Heil Honey I'm Home!
10. Em quais categorias a BSB está classificada?;Companhia

I need to make sure the answers are accurate based on the context and facts. For example, the RDF mentions "ns3:hypernym" as "Company", so the answer for question 10 is "Companhia". Also, the channels like Galaxy, Now, The Computer Channel are mentioned in the facts. So the answer for question 6 is "Galaxy". The films are mentioned as "Memphis Belle" and "Heil Honey I'm Home!".

This should cover the required 10 pairs.
