Okay, so I need to generate 10 pairs of questions and answers based on the given context about the Scottish Parliament. Let me go through this step by step.

First, I'll read through the context carefully to understand all the key points. The context provides information about the structure, history, elections, and functions of the Scottish Parliament. There are facts about its unicameral nature, number of members (129), election details, political parties involved, and various committees it has.

I notice that the context mentions specific dates, like the last election in 2021 on May 6th, and historical events such as the establishment in 1998. There's also information about different constituencies, their names, and the political parties holding seats. Additionally, there are details about key figures, including the First Minister and Presiding Officer.

Now, I need to create varied questions that cover different aspects of this information. Each question should be clear and have a single correct answer based on the provided context.

Starting with basic facts: when was the current Scottish Parliament established? That's straightforward from the context, which states 1998.

Next, how many members does it have? The number is given as 129.

Then, where is it located? The information says Edinburgh.

What type of legislature is it? It’s unicameral, so that can be another question.

The last election date is provided in the facts section as May 6, 2021.

Which party has the most seats? From the context, the Scottish National Party (SNP) is mentioned, and it's likely they have the majority, but I need to confirm. Wait, looking at the facts again: "Scottish National Party possui título do assento 2 Scottish Parliament" – no, this might not directly indicate the number of seats. Maybe another approach: looking for party mentions, but perhaps a better question is about its structure as a unicameral parliament.

Wait, in the context, it says "the current Parlamento was established by the Scotland Act of 1998." So I can ask which act established it, with the answer being the Scotland Act 1998.

Another point: the number of constituencies. From the facts, each constituency has a name, but perhaps how many electoral regions? The context mentions eight regions, each electing seven members, so that's another question.

What about the leader's title? The Presiding Officer is mentioned as a type of leader.

The First Minister responds to the Scottish Parliament, which can be a question about who does that.

I should make sure I cover different areas: structure, history, functions, key figures, and electoral details.

Let me list possible questions:

1. When was the current Scottish Parliament established? (Answer: 1998)
2. How many members does it have? (129)
3. Where is it located? (Edinburgh)
4. What type of legislature is it? (Unicameral)
5. Which act established it? (Scotland Act 1998)
6. How many electoral regions are there? (Eight)
7. Who is the leader? (Presiding Officer, or name if specific)
Wait, looking at the facts: "Scottish Parliament possui líder Alison Johnstone" and also "Nicola Sturgeon." Hmm, but these seem conflicting; perhaps it's better to ask about the role rather than a specific person since names might change.

Alternatively, ask what the Presiding Officer is responsible for or what their role is.

Wait, in the context, it says "Scottish Parliament possesses líder --05-08" which seems like an error. Maybe I should avoid that and instead focus on the structure.

Another idea: What party has the most seats? From the facts, the SNP has title seat 2, but perhaps they have the majority. However, without specific numbers, it's hard to be precise. Alternatively, ask what the maximum number of seats a party can hold is.

Alternatively, since the context mentions that the First Minister responds to the Parliament, I can frame a question around that.

I need to ensure each answer is accurate based on the provided data.

Let me try to outline 10 questions:

1. When was the current Scottish Parliament established?
   - Answer: 1998

2. How many members does it have?
   - Answer: 129

3. Where is the Scottish Parliament located?
   - Answer: Edinburgh

4. What type of legislature is the Scottish Parliament?
   - Answer: Unicameral

5. Which act established the current structure of the Scottish Parliament?
   - Answer: Scotland Act 1998

6. How many electoral regions are there in Scotland for the Parliament?
   - Answer: Eight

7. Who is the Presiding Officer of the Scottish Parliament?
   - From facts: Alison Johnstone and Nicola Sturgeon; but perhaps more accurate to say the role is the Presiding Officer.

Wait, looking back at the facts, I see "Scottish Parliament possui líder Alison Johnstone" and also "Scottish Parliament possui líder --05-08" which seems like a placeholder. Maybe it's better to ask about the role rather than the name.

Alternatively, since Nicola Sturgeon is mentioned as a leader, perhaps she was the First Minister at some point.

Let me adjust:

7. Who is responsible for responding to the Scottish Parliament?
   - Answer: The First Minister

8. What is the maximum number of seats a political party can hold in the Scottish Parliament?
   - Since there are 129 members and using proportional representation, no single party has a majority unless it's SNP with over half.

But perhaps more straightforward to ask about the structure regarding regions and seats per region.

Alternatively:

8. How many members does each electoral region elect?
   - Answer: Seven

9. What is the name of the debating chamber in the Scottish Parliament?
   - From facts: "Scottish Parliament Debating Chamber 2.jpg"

10. Which political party has traditionally held a majority in the Scottish Parliament?
    - Answer: Scottish National Party (SNP)

I think that covers a good range, ensuring each answer is directly supported by the context provided.
