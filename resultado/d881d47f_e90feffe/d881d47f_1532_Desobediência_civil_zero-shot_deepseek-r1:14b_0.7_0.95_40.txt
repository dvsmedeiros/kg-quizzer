Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to create 10 multiple-choice questions based on the given context about civil disobedience. The user provided a Portuguese text explaining what it is and isn't, its characteristics, historical examples, purposes, differences from other actions, and considerations for legitimacy.

First, I need to understand the content thoroughly. Civil disobedience involves nonviolent actions against laws seen as unjust, aiming to bring change without causing harm. Examples include Gandhi's protests in India and Rosa Parks' refusal to give up her seat. It's not random acts of destruction but organized resistance.

Now, I need to generate varied questions covering different aspects: definitions, examples, characteristics, purposes, differences from other actions, and considerations for legitimacy. Each question should have a clear correct answer based on the text.

I'll start by listing key points from each section:

1. Definition and nature of civil disobedience.
2. Examples like Gandhi and Parks.
3. Not random destruction but organized.
4. Nonviolent methods.
5. Goals include social change, rights promotion.
6. Differences from other forms (terrorism, rioting).
7. Legitimacy based on just cause, proportionality.

Now, I'll think of possible questions:

- What is civil disobedience? It's nonviolent resistance to laws seen as unjust.
- Who led the Salt March in India? Gandhi.
- Which event marked a significant moment for civil rights in the US? Rosa Parks' refusal.
- Is destruction part of civil disobedience? No, it's organized and non-violent.
- What is a main goal? To force change without violence.
- How does it differ from terrorism? It's nonviolent against people, not targeting innocent civilians.
- Why is just cause important? Because unjust actions can lead to more repression or international rejection.

I need to make sure each question is unique and covers different aspects. I should avoid repeating similar questions and ensure the answers are directly supported by the text.

Wait, let me check if I have 10 points covered:

1. Definition
2. Example (Gandhi)
3. Nature (organized vs random)
4. Nonviolence
5. Purpose (social change)
6. Example (Parks)
7. Differences from terrorism/rioting
8. Legitimacy aspect (just cause, proportionality)
9. How it's different from other actions
10. Consequences without just cause

I think that covers all necessary aspects. Now, I'll structure each as a question and answer in CSV format.
