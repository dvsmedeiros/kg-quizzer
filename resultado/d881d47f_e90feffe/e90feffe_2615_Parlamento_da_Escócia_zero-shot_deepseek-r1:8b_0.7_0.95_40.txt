Okay, so I need to create 10 pairs of questions and correct answers based on the provided context about Scotland's Parliament. The user has given a context with some key points: it's called the Scottish Parliament, uses Gaelic and English, was established in 1999 after a referendum, has 129 members, is a unicameral legislature without aupper house, and its authority comes from the Scotland Act of 1998.

First, I should make sure that each question is unique and covers different aspects of the content. Each question must be directly related to the context provided. The answers need to be correct and can be inferred or explicitly stated in the context.

Let me list out possible questions based on the context:

1. What is the name of Scotland's Parliament?
2. In which year was the Scottish Parliament established?
3. How many members does it have?
4. Which languages are officially used by the Parliament?
5. Is the Scottish Parliament bicameral or unicameral?
6. Who has the authority to make laws in Scotland according to the context?
7. What is the name of the law that granted the Parliament its powers?
8. When did the referendum on the Scottish Parliament take place?
9. Are there any regional representatives in the Parliament?
10. Does the Parliament have a separate upper house or not?

Now, I'll make sure each question has one correct answer based on the context.

1. The name is the Scottish Parliament.
2. Established in 1999.
3. Has 129 members.
4. Uses Gaelic and English.
5. It's unicameral.
6. Authority comes from the Scotland Act of 1998.
7. Same as above, the law is the Scotland Act 1998.
8. The referendum was in 1997.
9. Yes, there are regional representatives based on counties.
10. No, it doesn't have an upper house.

I think these cover different aspects without repetition and each question relates directly to the context.
