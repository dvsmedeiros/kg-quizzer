Okay, so I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs based on the provided context and facts about civil disobedience. The user has given a detailed context and some example pairs, but they want me to create new ones.

First, let's understand the main points from the context:

- Civil disobedience is a form of peaceful protest against unjust laws or oppressive governments.
- It was first formulated by Henry David Thoreau.
- Key figures who applied it include Mahatma Gandhi and Martin Luther King Jr.
- It involves nonviolent methods to challenge laws seen as unfair.

Looking at the facts, there are several protests listed that use civil disobedience. These can serve as examples for questions about specific instances or movements.

I need to make sure each question is unique and covers different aspects of civil disobedience. I should also ensure that each answer is directly supported by the context or the provided facts.

Let me start brainstorming some questions:

1. Who was an early proponent of civil disobedience? (Henry David Thoreau)
2. Which method did Martin Luther King Jr. use in his activism? (Civil Disobedience)
3. What movement used civil disobedience to fight segregation? (Movement for Civil Rights)
4. Name a protest using civil disobedience against corruption in Montenegro. (Montenegrin anti-corruption protests 2019)
5. Which Indian leader successfully applied civil disobedience? (Mahatma Gandhi)
6. What is the primary purpose of civil disobedience? (Oppose unjust laws or oppressive governments)
7. Which protest used civil disobedience in response to police brutality? (End SARS movement)
8. What historical figure's ideas influenced Thoreau on civil disobedience? (Ralph Waldo Emerson)
9. Name a method used during the American Civil Rights Movement. (Sit-ins, boycotts)
10. How is civil disobedience characterized? (Peaceful and nonviolent)

Wait, some of these might not be directly in the context or facts. For example, Ralph Waldo Emerson's influence on Thoreau isn't mentioned here. So I should avoid that.

I need to stick strictly to the provided context and facts. Let me adjust:

1. Who formulated the concept of civil disobedience? (Henry David Thoreau)
2. Which method was used by Martin Luther King Jr.? (Civil Disobedience)
3. What movement opposed segregation in the US using this method? (Civil Rights Movement)
4. Name a protest against corruption that used civil disobedience. (Montenegrin anti-corruption protests 2019)
5. Which leader applied it successfully in India? (Mahatma Gandhi)
6. What do people do when a government doesn't meet their demands? (Desobedecer)
7. Which movement used civil disobedience against police brutality? (End SARS)
8. What category includes civil disobedience as a form of activism? (Category: Civil Disobedience)
9. Where were methods like sit-ins and boycotts first widely used? (US during Civil Rights Movement)
10. How is civil disobedience characterized? (Peaceful and nonviolent)

Hmm, but some answers might be too short or not specific enough. Let me make sure each answer directly references the context.

Another approach: look at the facts provided to find events or people associated with civil disobedience.

For example:

- Assam Movement used civil disobedience.
- 2017 Albanian opposition protest utilized it.
- Thirty Meter Telescope protests also used it.

So I can create questions around these specific instances.

I should avoid repeating similar questions, like asking about the purpose multiple times. Each question should address a different aspect: historical figures, methods, movements, examples from different regions, etc.

Let me structure them:

1. Who is known for formulating civil disobedience? (Thoreau)
2. Which movement in India used it effectively? (Independence Movement led by Gandhi)
3. What US movement used this method against segregation? (Civil Rights Movement)
4. Name a protest in Montenegro using civil disobedience. (2019 anti-corruption protests)
5. What is the primary reason for practicing civil disobedience? (Opposition to unjust laws or oppressive governments)
6. Which Nigerian movement against police brutality used it? (End SARS)
7. What does Tony Milligan study? (Civil Disobedience)
8. Name a protest in Poland that used this method. (2020 LGBT protests)
9. How was the Indian independence achieved with civil disobedience? (Nonviolent methods like boycotts, strikes)
10. Which US figure promoted civil disobedience as a form of nonviolent resistance? (Martin Luther King Jr.)

I think these cover various aspects: historical figures, movements, regions, purposes, and specific examples.

Now, I'll convert them into the required CSV format with questions and answers in Portuguese.
