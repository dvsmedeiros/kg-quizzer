pergunta;resposta
Wait, the user's examples are in Portuguese, but the instruction says "Gere agora os 10 pares `pergunta;resposta` conforme as instruções e regras acima." So, the user wants the questions and answers in Portuguese, similar to the examples provided.
I think these 10 questions and answers cover different aspects and are in line with the examples provided. Now, I can format them as per the user's examples, using the `pergunta;resposta` format with semicolons and proper Portuguese.
