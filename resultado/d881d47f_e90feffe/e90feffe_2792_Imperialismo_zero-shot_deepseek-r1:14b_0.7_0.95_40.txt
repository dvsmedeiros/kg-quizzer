Okay, so I have to create 10 true/false questions based on the provided content about imperialism. The user gave me an example with 5 pairs and now wants exactly 10 in CSV format without any extra text.

First, I need to understand the context thoroughly. Imperialism involves dominant countries extending their power over others, often leading to economic exploitation, cultural imposition, and political control. It's important to cover various aspects like causes, effects, key terms, and related concepts.

Looking at the example provided, they covered different angles: economic practices, negative impacts, main actors in history, characteristics of colonies, and resistance movements. I should follow a similar approach but expand it to 10 questions.

I'll start by brainstorming various aspects of imperialism:
- Types of imperialism (economic, cultural)
- Key terms like colony, empire, imperialism
- Effects on both colonizers and colonized
- Causes of imperialism
- Resistance methods
- Modern forms or impacts

Now, I need to frame each as a true/false question with the correct answer based on general knowledge about imperialism. Each question should be distinct and cover different facets.

Let me list them out:

1. Was mercantilism a practice associated with imperialism? (Yes)
2. Did imperialism often result in resource exploitation? (Yes)
3. Were colonies considered vital for economic strength during imperialism? (Yes)
4. Was military force used by imperialist nations? (Yes)
5. Did indigenous cultures face suppression under imperialism? (Yes)
6. Was the term "neocolonialism" related to imperialism? (Yes)
7. Could imperialism be justified through the idea of civilizing mission? (Yes)
8. Did technological advancements aid imperialist expansion? (Yes)
9. Was nationalism a factor in driving imperialism? (Yes)
10. Did imperialism contribute to global inequality? (Yes)

Wait, I need to ensure each question is unique and covers different points. Let me check for repetition or overlapping topics.

Each of these questions touches on different aspects: economic practices, resource extraction, colony importance, military tactics, cultural suppression, neocolonialism, civilizing mission, technology's role, nationalism, and global inequality.

Now, I'll structure each as a CSV pair with the question in Portuguese and the correct answer (either "Sim" or "Não").

I need to make sure there are no markdown formats and only the required CSV output. Also, ensure that each line is correctly formatted without additional explanations.
