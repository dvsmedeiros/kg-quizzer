Okay, let's tackle this task step by step. The user wants me to generate a CSV with exactly 10 question-response pairs based on the provided context and facts. 

First, I need to understand the context given. It mentions "Império (do latim imperium = poder, autoridade)" which refers to a territorial or political authority. There are several aspects mentioned like Imperialism, Political theories, and various examples of empires.

Next, looking at the facts provided, I see terms like "Imperialism Romanum" as the main form of imperialism in the context. Also, specific images for France (1940), Japan, Spain, Russia, and the United States are mentioned. These will be helpful in creating relevant questions.

Now, for each fact, I can create a question related to its significance or impact on political theories. The responses should explain the relevance of each empire within the context of political ideologies like Marxian economics or authoritarianism.

I need to ensure that there are 10 unique questions and their corresponding answers. Each question should be clear and directly tied to an aspect of imperialism, providing a relevant context for the response.

Let me list out possible questions based on the facts:

1. What was the primary significance of the French Empire in terms of political theories?
2. How did the Japanese Empire reflect Imperialism in political ideologies?
3. What role did the Spanish Empire play in shaping political ideologies through Imperialism?
4. How did the Russian Empire influence political theories and ideologies?
5. What impact did the United States have on political ideologies influenced by Imperialism?

Now, I'll create questions 6 to 10 that cover different regions or aspects of the factual information provided.

For each question, the response should link it back to a specific political theory or ideology related to Imperialism. For example, the French Empire might relate to Marxist economic theories, while the Russian Empire could be associated with authoritarianism and bureaucracy.

I also need to ensure that the CSV format is correct: each row has "pergunta" on the left and "resposta" on the right, separated by semicolons, and then the separator ";". The entire CSV should not include any additional text or comments except for the header.

Finally, I'll compile all 10 questions and their responses into a single CSV format as per the user's instructions.
