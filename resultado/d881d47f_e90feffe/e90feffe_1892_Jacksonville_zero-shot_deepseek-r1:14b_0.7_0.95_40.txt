Okay, I need to create 10 multiple-choice questions based on the provided context about Jacksonville. The user has given specific instructions, so I'll follow them carefully.

First, I should read through the context information thoroughly to understand what's available. It includes general facts like population, location, economy, cultural aspects, transportation, climate, and some notable features or events related to Jacksonville.

Now, I need to generate 10 questions that cover different aspects of this content. Each question must have one correct answer, and the answers should be directly supported by the context provided.

I'll start by identifying key points:

1. **Population**: Over 900,000.
2. **Location**: Northeast Florida, Atlantic Ocean.
3. **Economy**: Agriculture, manufacturing, trade.
4. **Cultural Features**: Riverfronts, historical sites like Fort Caroline.
5. **Transportation**: Port of Jacksonville, JAXARTS.
6. **Climate**: Warm summers, mild winters.
7. **Notable Events**: Florida-Georgia Game.

I'll vary the questions to cover each of these areas without repeating similar topics. I need to ensure that each question is clear and directly relates to the context provided.

Let me draft some possible questions:

1. What is Jacksonville's population? (Answer: Over 900,000)
2. Where is Jacksonville located in Florida? (Answer: Northeast)
3. What bodies of water border Jacksonville? (Answer: Atlantic Ocean)
4. Which industry is significant to Jacksonville? (Agriculture)
5. What cultural site is in Jacksonville? (Fort Caroline)
6. What does JAXARTS stand for? (Jacksonville Aviation and Transportation)
7. When is the Florida-Georgia Game held? (November)
8. Where are the St. Johns Riverfronts located? (Downtown)
9. What's Jacksonville's climate like? (Mild winters, warm summers)
10. What does the port of Jacksonville handle? (Agriculture exports)

I need to make sure each question is clear and has only one correct answer. Also, I should avoid making the questions too similar in structure or topic.

Now, I'll format these as CSV pairs, using semicolons to separate the question and answer.
