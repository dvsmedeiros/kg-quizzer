Okay, so I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the context provided about the Scottish Parliament. Let me start by understanding what information is available.

The context mentions that the Scottish Parliament was established under the Scotland Act of 1998 and began operating in 1999. It's unicameral, meaning it has only one chamber, unlike some other parliaments which have two houses. The parliament consists of 129 members: 73 elected directly from constituencies, and 56 others selected through a system of proportional representation. 

The building where the Scottish Parliament is housed was opened in 2004 and is notable for its unique design, including a "ship" shape and an exposed steel structure. The architect responsible for this design is Enric Miralles. Edinburgh is the capital of Scotland and serves as the location of both the Scottish Parliament and the UK Parliament building.

Now, I'll think about how to create varied questions that cover different aspects of this context without repeating similar ones. Each question should have a clear and correct answer based on the provided information.

1. **When was the Scottish Parliament established?** - This directly asks for the year mentioned in the context.
2. **How many members are there in total in the Scottish Parliament?** - Adds up the 73 constituency members and 56 regional ones.
3. **What is the name of the building where the Scottish Parliament is located?** - Tests knowledge of the parliament's location specifics.
4. **Which architect designed the Scottish Parliament building?** - Focuses on a specific detail about the building's design.
5. **How many members are elected directly from constituencies in the Scottish Parliament?** - Targets a subset of the total membership.
6. **When was the Scottish Parliament building opened?** - Asks for another specific year related to the parliament's infrastructure.
7. **What is the term used to describe a single-chamber legislature, such as the Scottish Parliament?** - Tests understanding of political terminology.
8. **How many regional members are there in the Scottish Parliament?** - Another subset question, focusing on proportional representation members.
9. **Where is the Scottish Parliament located?** - Basic geographical knowledge about the parliament's location.
10. **What does PR stand for in the context of the Scottish Parliament elections?** - Assesses understanding of abbreviations used in electoral systems.

I need to make sure each question is unique and covers different aspects without overlap. I'll also ensure that the answers are directly derived from the provided context, avoiding any ambiguity.
