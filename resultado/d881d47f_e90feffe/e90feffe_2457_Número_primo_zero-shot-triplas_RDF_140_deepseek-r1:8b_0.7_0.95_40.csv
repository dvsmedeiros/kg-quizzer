Okay; so I need to come up with 10 questions and answers related to prime numbers based on the given information. Let me start by understanding what the user provided.
3. Can even numbers be prime? (Yes; only 2)
Wait; the data mentions that Scherk and Noll are known for prime numbers. So maybe question 10 could be about them.
2. Is 2 considered a prime number? - Yes; 2 is the smallest and only even prime number.
7. Is 1 considered a prime number? - No; because it only has one divisor.
9. Can composite numbers be prime? - No; composites have factors other than 1 and themselves.
I think these cover a range of topics related to primes. I need to make sure the answers are concise and accurate based on the provided data or general knowledge; which seems acceptable here.
Here is a set of 10 questions and answers about prime numbers; thoughtfully curated from both the provided data and general knowledge:
   - Yes; 2 is the smallest and only even prime number.
   - As of current knowledge; it remains unknown if there is a largest prime number.
