Okay, I need to generate 10 CSV question-answer pairs based on the provided context and facts about the Normans. Let me start by understanding the context and the facts given.

The context mentions that the Normans were a Germanic people from northern France, with aristocracy from Vikings. They had a significant role in politics, military, and culture in medieval Europe and the Middle East. Examples include the Norman conquest of England, Sicily, and the Crusades. Their history led to many legends.

Looking at the facts, there are several RDF triples. For instance, the Normans are related to battles like the Battle of Cerami, Civitate, etc. There are also mentions of their language (Latin, Old Norman, Old Norse), religion (Christianity, Norse paganism), and their connection to places like Taunton Castle and Waytemore Castle. Also, they are linked to historical figures like Alexander of Paris and Richard of Salerno.

Now, I need to create 10 varied questions. Let me think of different aspects:

1. Origin: Where did the Normans originate?
2. Etymology: What does "Norman" mean?
3. Language: What languages did they speak?
4. Religion: What religions were practiced?
5. Notable battles: Which battle involved Normans?
6. Historical figures: Who is associated with Normans?
7. Architecture: What style is associated with Norman architecture?
8. Colonization: What region did they colonize?
9. Crusades: Were they involved in the Crusades?
10. Classification: What category do they fall under?

Wait, the user wants questions based on the facts provided. Let me check the facts again. The facts include their origin in northern France, their connection to Vikings, their role in battles, languages, religions, and their classification as an ethnic group. Also, they are linked to specific places and events like the Siege of Mahdia, Taunton Castle, and the Bayeux Tapestry.

So, possible questions:

1. What is the origin of the Normans?
2. What does the term "Norman" derive from?
3. Which languages were spoken by the Normans?
4. What religions were associated with the Normans?
5. Which historical battle involved the Normans?
6. What is the architectural style linked to the Normans?
7. Which region did the Normans colonize?
8. What is the modern classification of the Normans?
9. Which medieval event did the Normans participate in?
10. What is the significance of the Bayeux Tapestry in relation to the Normans?

Wait, need to ensure each question is distinct and based on the facts. Let me verify each against the provided data.

For example, the fact mentions the Normans are a Germanic people from northern France, so origin question is valid. The term "Norman" comes from "Northmen" or Norsemen, so etymology is covered. Languages include Latin, Old Norman, Old Norse. Religions are Christianity and Norse paganism. Battles like the Siege of Mahdia. Architectural style is Norman architecture. Colonized Normandy. Modern classification as an ethnic group. Crusades are mentioned in the context, but the facts don't explicitly state they were involved, but the context does. The Bayeux Tapestry is mentioned in the image caption.

I need to make sure the answers are directly from the facts. Let me structure each pair accordingly. Let me check for duplicates and ensure each question is unique. Once I have 10, I can format them into CSV.
