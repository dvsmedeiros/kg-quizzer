Okay, let me try to figure this out step by step. So, the user wants me to generate a quiz with 10 pairs of questions and answers based on the provided context about civil disobedience. They want it in CSV format, which is just a table with two columns separated by semicolons.

First, I need to understand what civil disobedience is from the context given. It's a form of peaceful protest against government actions or laws that are perceived as unjust. The context mentions notable examples like Gandhi and Thoreau, so those could be good sources for questions.

I should come up with 10 different questions that cover various aspects of civil disobedience. Each question needs to have one correct answer based on the provided facts. I also need to make sure the questions are varied and each relates specifically to the content.

Looking at the facts, there's a lot about how civil disobedience is used in protests across different countries and historical events. There are mentions of specific movements like the Assam Movement, the Russian miners' strike, and more recent ones like the Kenosha unrest. That gives me some concrete examples to base the questions on.

I should also consider including general knowledge, such as who invented civil disobedience or its main characteristics. Maybe a question about its purpose or how it's categorized (like direct action). Including some famous figures could make the quiz more engaging and educational.

Now, thinking of each question:

1. When was the concept of civil disobedience first introduced? - This relates to Thoreau.
2. Which organization is known for using civil disobedience in protests against fees and cuts? - Refers to Iranian protests.
3. Tony Milligan has a main interest related to which topic? - From the facts, he's associated with Civil Disobedience.
4. What is an example of a protest that utilized civil disobedience in 2019? - The Kenosha unrest fits here.
5. Which organization uses the method of civil disobedience? - Ruckus Society is mentioned.
6. Which historical event used civil disobedience as its method? - The Russian miners' strike from 1886.
7. According to the context, which organizations are applying civil disobedience? - End SARS and the 2019 Montenegrin protests.
8. What is a notable characteristic of civil disobedience? - It's peaceful and pacific.
9. Which historical movement used civil disobedience as its method? - The Assam Movement in 1864.
10. Which individual is known for civil disobedience, particularly in his opposition to a government? - Tony Milligan.

I need to make sure each answer directly relates to the context provided and that there are no duplicates or overlapping questions. Also, ensuring that each question is clear and directly tied to the content will help in creating an effective quiz.
