Okay, the user wants me to generate 10 pairs of questions and answers in CSV format based on the provided context and facts about Jacksonville, Florida. Let me start by carefully reading through the context and the list of facts to ensure I cover different aspects.

First, the context gives general information about Jacksonville: it's the most populous city in Florida, located in Duval County, third most populous on the East Coast, population around 950k, founded in 1791, incorporated in 1832, situated along the St. Johns River, etc. Then there are a bunch of specific facts about events, people, and places related to Jacksonville.

I need to create 10 unique questions that cover various aspects. Let me brainstorm possible questions. The user mentioned avoiding repetition, so I need to make sure each question is on a different topic. Let me check the facts again to see what's there.

Some facts are about historical events (like the Fort Caroline, the establishment in 1822, the Super Bowl in 2005), people (Sean Winter, Al Baker, etc.), sports teams (Jacksonville Jaguars, Florida Gators, etc.), roads and landmarks (Florida State Road 9B, Duval County Courthouse), and weather records (high and low temperatures in different months).

I should make sure each question is based on these facts. For example, a question about the city's population, another about the founding date, another about the Super Bowl, another about the weather record, another about a specific road, another about a sports team, another about a historical event, another about a person born there, another about a landmark, and another about the city's ranking.

Wait, the user specified that each question must be relevant to the context and have a single correct answer. I need to ensure that each answer is either explicitly stated or can be directly inferred from the facts provided.

Let me list possible questions:

1. What is the population of Jacksonville according to the 2020 census?
2. When was Jacksonville incorporated?
3. Which Super Bowl was held in Jacksonville in 2005?
4. What is the record high temperature in Jacksonville in January?
5. Which Florida State Road has its endpoint in Jacksonville?
6. What is the name of the courthouse in Jacksonville?
7. Who was the first governor of Florida and after whom was Jacksonville named?
8. What is the name of the river near Jacksonville?
9. Which sports team is based in Jacksonville?
10. What is the rank of Jacksonville in terms of population in the United States?

Now, I need to check if these questions are based on the provided facts. The population is mentioned as 950k. Incorporated in 1832. Super Bowl XXXIX in 2005. Record high in January is 85°F. Florida State Road 9B ends there. Duval County Courthouse. Andrew Jackson was the first governor, after whom it's named. St. Johns River. Jacksonville Jaguars. Rank 1st in Florida, 12th in the US.

Wait, the context says "Jacksonville é a cidade mais populosa do estado norte-americano da Flórida" so rank 1st in Florida, but the facts mention it's 12th in the country. The user's instruction says to base the questions on the context and facts, so the answer to the 10th question should be 1st in Florida, but the user's facts also mention 12th in the country. However, the user's instruction says to use the context and facts provided. The context says "a 12ª mais populosa do país", so the answer to the question about the country's ranking is 12th. But the question I had in mind was about the state's rank, which is first. So that's a good one.

Now, let's check if these questions are all covered. The user's facts also include several people and other details, but maybe the questions should be spread across different aspects. I need to make sure each question is unique and covers different aspects. The answer for the first question is 950k. The second is 1832. The third is Super Bowl XXXIX. Fourth is 85°F. Fifth is Florida State Road 9B. Sixth is Duval County Courthouse. Seventh is Andrew Jackson. Eighth is St. Johns River. Ninth is Jacksonville Jaguars. Tenth is 1st in Florida.

Yes, that's 10 questions. Now, I need to structure them in CSV format with the correct answers. Each question is a separate line in the CSV, with the separator being a semicolon. The language is Portuguese. I need to make sure the answers are in Portuguese as well. Let me check the answers again for accuracy based on the context and facts.

For example, the answer to the question about the Super Bowl in 2005 is "XXXIX Super Bowl". The answer for the record high temperature in January is "85°F". The answer for the road is "Florida State Road 9B". The courthouse is "Duval County Courthouse". The answer for the first governor is "Andrew Jackson". The river is "rio St. Johns". The sports team is "Jacksonville Jaguars". The rank in the state is "1º lugar no estado da Flórida".

I think that's all correct. Now, I'll format these into the CSV pairs as required.
