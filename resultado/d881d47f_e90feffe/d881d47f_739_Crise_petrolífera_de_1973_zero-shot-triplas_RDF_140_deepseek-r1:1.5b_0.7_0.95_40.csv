Okay; I need to create ten pairs of questions and answers based on the provided context and rules. Let me go through each part carefully.
Now; I need to structure each question and answer pair correctly. Each should be in CSV format with a comma separating the two entries. The first part is "pergunta" and the second is "resposta".
I'll make sure that each response is clear and directly related to the context provided. For example; the price drop is a direct result of the oil crisis. Supply shortages are another key point.
Also; I need to avoid any markdown or special formatting beyond what's specified in the CSV format. Just use commas to separate each pair.
3. What were the immediate economic impacts; like supply shortages?
Now; I'll create questions 6-10 based on this understanding. Each should explore a different angle.
For question 6: What were the immediate economic impacts; like supply shortages?
10: What led to the subsequent energy crisis; including other countries' actions.
Now; structuring each pair and ensuring all points from the context are covered without repeating any information.
