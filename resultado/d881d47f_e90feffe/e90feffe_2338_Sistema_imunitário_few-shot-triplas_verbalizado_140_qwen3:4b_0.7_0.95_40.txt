Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the provided context and facts. Let me start by understanding the context and the facts given.

The context talks about the immune system, its components, functions, and related concepts. The facts list various elements that are part of the immune system, such as white blood cells, basophils, lymphocytes, T cells, B cells, etc. There are also mentions of templates used in Wikipedia for the immune system, related medical conditions like sepsis and food allergies, and some people associated with the immune system, like Ilya Mechnikov and César Milstein.

First, I need to create questions that are related to these facts. The questions should be varied and cover different aspects. For example, I can ask about the components of the immune system, the functions, related medical conditions, people associated with the field, and the structure of the immune system.

I need to make sure each question has a unique answer and is directly derived from the given facts. Let me check the examples provided. The examples include questions about the protection against diseases, agents detected, parts of the immune system, types of immunity, etc. So I should follow a similar structure but ensure that the questions are not repeated and cover different aspects.

Let me list out possible questions:

1. What are some components of the immune system?
2. What is the term for a system that is overly active and attacks normal tissues?
3. Who is known for the term "immune system"?
4. What is the primary function of the immune system?
5. What is the medical condition caused by an underactive immune system?
6. What are the two main types of immunity?
7. What are some examples of cells involved in the immune system?
8. What is the role of the lymphatic system in the immune system?
9. What is the term for a system that protects against pathogens?
10. What is the main area of study in immunology?

Now, I need to check if these questions are based on the facts. The facts mention that the immune system is a system that protects against diseases, includes cells like T cells, B cells, macrophages, etc., and that Ilya Mechnikov coined the term. Also, the immune system has adaptive and innate components, and conditions like immunodeficiency and autoimmunity are mentioned.

I should make sure the answers are correct. For example, the answer to the first question could be a list of cells like white blood cells, basophils, etc. The answer to the second question is autoimmunity. The third question would be Ilya Mechnikov. The fourth is the primary function, which is protection against pathogens. The fifth is immunodeficiency. The sixth is adaptive and innate immunity. The seventh could be cells like T cells, B cells, macrophages. The eighth is the lymphatic system's role in transporting lymph and immune cells. The ninth is the immune system. The tenth is immunology.

Wait, but the user provided examples where the answers are more specific. For instance, in the example, "What are the two types of immunity?" the answer is "imunidade humoral versus imunidade mediada por células." So I need to ensure that the answers are precise and match the facts.

Looking back at the facts, there are mentions of "immunidade adquirida" and "imunidade inata" as the two main types. Also, the immune system has adaptive and innate components. So the answer should be "imunidade inata e imunidade adaptativa" or similar.

I need to make sure each answer is correct and directly from the context or facts. Also, avoid repeating similar questions. For example, the example had a question about the two types of immunity, so I should not repeat that. Instead, I can ask about the components, the people associated, the functions, etc.

Let me check the facts again. The facts include "César Milstein é conhecido por Immune system" and "Lajos Kemény é conhecido por Immune system". So a question about who is known for the immune system could have those names as answers.

Another fact is "Sepsis tem como causa médica Immune system", so a question about the cause of sepsis could be answered with the immune system.

Also, there are mentions of the immune system's structure, like the lymphatic system, and the use of templates in Wikipedia for the immune system.

So, I need to make sure that each question is unique and based on the facts provided. Let me try to structure the 10 questions accordingly.
