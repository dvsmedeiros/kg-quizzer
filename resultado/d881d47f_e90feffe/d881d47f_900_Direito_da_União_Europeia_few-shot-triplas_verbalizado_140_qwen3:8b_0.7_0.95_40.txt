Okay, let me tackle this query. The user wants me to generate 10 CSV pairs of questions and answers based on the provided context and facts. First, I need to understand the context and facts thoroughly.

The context talks about the European Union's legal system, its goals, institutions, and the concept of a new international legal order. The facts mention legal scholars like John Bell and Henry G. Schermers, along with some Wikipedia templates related to the Law of the European Union.

Looking at the examples, the questions are about the definition of EU law, its sources (primary, secondary, etc.), key institutions, and the effect on member states' laws. I need to make sure the questions are varied and cover different aspects without repetition.

I should start by identifying key points from the context and facts. The main topics are the definition of EU law, its sources (primary, secondary, complementary), institutions like the European Parliament and Council, the role of the Court of Justice, the legal order, and the scholars mentioned. Also, the Wikipedia templates are part of the facts but might not be as relevant unless the user wants something specific about them.

Wait, the user's examples include questions about primary sources like treaties, regulations, directives. The facts mention Common Market Law Review and John Bell's work. Maybe I can include a question about the main discipline or scholars involved. Also, the mention of the Tribunal de Justiça's statement about a new legal order could be a question.

I need to ensure each question is unique and answers are derived directly from the context and facts. Let me list possible questions:

1. What is the main objective of the EU? (Answer: promote peace, values, and well-being)
2. What is the Law of the European Union? (Answer: body of treaties and legislation)
3. What are the primary sources of EU law? (Treaties)
4. What are secondary sources? (Regulations, directives)
5. What is the role of the European Court of Justice? (New international legal order)
6. Who are key scholars in EU law? (John Bell, Henry G. Schermers)
7. What is the effect of EU law on member states? (Direct or indirect)
8. What are the main institutions? (Parliament, Council)
9. What is the significance of the Common Market Law Review? (Discipline of EU law)
10. What does the EU legal system transcend? (National states for cooperation)

Wait, the user's examples already have some of these. I need to avoid repetition. Let me check the examples again. The examples have questions about primary sources, secondary sources, institutions, effect on member states, and the three sources. So I need to vary the questions.

Maybe include questions about the Tribunal de Justiça's statement, the role of the Court, the main areas of study (like John Bell's work), and the Wikipedia templates. But the user might not care about the templates unless specified. The facts mention that Law of the European Union uses certain Wikipedia models, but the examples don't include that. Maybe it's better to focus on the main content.

So, I'll structure the questions to cover definition, objectives, sources, institutions, scholars, effect on member states, and the legal order. Let me make sure each question is distinct and answers are accurate. Also, check for any possible repetition in the examples provided by the user. Once I have 10 unique questions, format them into CSV with semicolons.
