Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the provided context. The context is about the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Let me start by recalling what the IPCC does. They assess scientific information related to climate change, its impacts, and potential future risks. They also evaluate options for reducing emissions and adapting to climate change.

First, I'll list key points from the context. The IPCC was established in 1988 by the UN and WMO. Its main role is to provide assessments on climate change. It has working groups that focus on different aspects like scientific aspects, impacts, and mitigation. The reports are comprehensive and used by policymakers. The IPCC does not conduct new research but synthesizes existing studies. It has a large network of scientists and experts. The reports are published periodically, such as the Assessment Reports. The IPCC's work is crucial for international agreements like the Paris Agreement. It's important to note that the IPCC's reports are based on peer-reviewed literature.

Now, I need to create varied questions covering different aspects. Let's start with the establishment date and organizations involved. Then, the main purpose, working groups, frequency of reports, use of peer-reviewed studies, network of scientists, role in international agreements, contribution to the Paris Agreement, and the nature of its work (synthesis vs. original research).

I need to ensure each question is unique and covers distinct aspects. Let me check for duplicates or overlapping topics. For example, the role in the Paris Agreement and international agreements can be separate questions. Also, the number of working groups and their focus areas. The answer to each must be directly inferable from the context provided.

Let me draft each question and answer:

1. When was the IPCC established and by which organizations?
   - 1988; United Nations and World Meteorological Organization.

2. What is the main purpose of the IPCC?
   - Assess scientific information on climate change, its impacts, and mitigation options.

3. How many working groups does the IPCC have and what are their focuses?
   - Three working groups: scientific aspects, impacts, and mitigation.

4. How often does the IPCC publish its Assessment Reports?
   - Periodically, with the latest being the Sixth Assessment Report.

5. Are the IPCC's reports based on peer-reviewed studies?
   - Yes, they synthesize existing peer-reviewed literature.

6. What is the role of the network of scientists and experts in the IPCC?
   - They contribute to the assessment process and ensure scientific accuracy.

7. Which international agreement was significantly influenced by the IPCC's work?
   - The Paris Agreement.

8. What is the IPCC's contribution to the Paris Agreement?
   - Provided scientific basis for setting emission reduction targets.

9. Does the IPCC conduct original research?
   - No, it synthesizes existing research and assessments.

10. What is the primary function of the IPCC's working groups?
    - To address different aspects of climate change, including science, impacts, and mitigation.

I need to make sure all answers are accurate and based on the context. Also, check that the questions are varied and not repetitive. Let me review each pair again. Yes, they cover different areas and are all distinct. Now, format them into CSV with semicolons.
