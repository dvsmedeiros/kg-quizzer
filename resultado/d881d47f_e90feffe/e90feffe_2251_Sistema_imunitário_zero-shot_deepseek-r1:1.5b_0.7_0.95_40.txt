Okay, I need to create a set of 10 objective questions related to the context provided, which is about a system in motion, specifically "Sistema_imunitário." The user wants each question paired with a correct response and formatted correctly using CSV.

First, I should identify different aspects or components within the imunitary system. Maybe things like mechanisms of movement, energy transfer, forces involved, safety measures, and challenges faced by systems relying on motion. This variety will make the quiz comprehensive.

For each aspect, I need to formulate a clear question that can be answered based on the given context. The responses should be straightforward or at least implied. For example, if one question is about mechanisms of movement, the response could involve details about springs or gears used in such systems.

I also need to ensure that there are no duplicate questions and that each response is unique. This means avoiding repeating the same concepts unless they're presented differently. Additionally, I must make sure that only the necessary information is included without adding any extra explanations or comments, as per the user's instructions.

Once all 10 questions are formulated, I will organize them into a CSV format where each row represents a question with its corresponding response. The delimiter should be semicolon (;) to separate each pair correctly.

I should also double-check that each question is relevant and directly tied to the context provided, ensuring that the quiz covers various facets of the imunitary system. This will help in providing a well-rounded assessment of understanding.

Finally, I'll review the CSV for formatting consistency, making sure that there are no syntax errors or missing commas that would disrupt the export process.
