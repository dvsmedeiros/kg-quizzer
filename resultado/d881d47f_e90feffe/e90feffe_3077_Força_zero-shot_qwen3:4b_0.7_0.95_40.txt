Okay, the user wants me to generate 10 objective questions and answers in CSV format based on the context provided, which is "Força". Let me start by understanding the context. Since the context is "Força", which is Portuguese for "Force", I need to create questions related to the concept of force in physics or maybe in a different context like sports, military, etc. But since the user didn't provide specific details, I have to assume the general meaning of force.

First, I should list possible aspects of force. In physics, force is a vector with magnitude, direction, and point of application. It's measured in newtons. Effects include acceleration, deformation, and interaction between objects. Types of forces include gravitational, electromagnetic, nuclear, and friction. Also, Newton's laws of motion are related to force.

Now, I need to create 10 different questions. Let me brainstorm:

1. What is the unit of force in the International System of Units (SI)?
2. What is the definition of force in physics?
3. What are the three types of forces mentioned in basic physics?
4. Which law of motion states that an object remains at rest unless acted upon by an external force?
5. What is the effect of force on an object?
6. What is the term for the force that opposes the motion of an object?
7. What is the formula for calculating the net force on an object?
8. Which force is responsible for the gravitational attraction between two objects?
9. What is the term for the force that holds the nucleus together?
10. How does force relate to the acceleration of an object?

Now, I need to ensure each question is unique and covers different aspects. Let me check if these are all valid and based on the context. The context is "Força", so maybe the user is referring to a specific topic, but since there's no additional info, I'll proceed with general physics concepts.

Wait, the user mentioned "Força" but didn't provide specific content. Maybe they expect questions about the concept of force in general. However, the initial instruction says to generate questions based on the context provided, which is just "Força". That's a bit confusing. Maybe the user made a mistake, but I have to work with what's given. Since there's no content, perhaps they intended to provide a different context but forgot. But according to the instructions, I should generate questions based on the given context, which is "Força". 

Alternatively, maybe "Força" is a topic in a specific subject, like a book or a lesson. But without more info, I have to assume it's general. So I'll proceed with the physics-related questions as above. Let me make sure each answer is correct and directly related. For example, the unit of force is Newton, definition is a push or pull, types include gravitational, electromagnetic, and friction, etc. 

I think these 10 questions cover different aspects. Let me check again for repetition. Each question is distinct. The answers are correct. Now, format them as CSV with the correct separator and language. Make sure no markdown and only the CSV. Alright, that should do it.
