Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the provided context and facts. Let me start by understanding the context thoroughly. The text explains the immune system, its functions, the scientist who coined the term, different mechanisms like phagocytosis, complement system, and the difference between adaptive and innate immunity. It also mentions diseases like autoimmune disorders and immunodeficiency.

Looking at the facts, there are several entities related to the immune system: B cells, T cells, neutrophils, macrophages, etc. Also, there are people associated with the immune system, like Ilya Mechnikov, César Milstein, and others. The examples given in the user's message include questions about the protection against diseases, agents detected, types of immunity, and specific components of the immune system.

I need to ensure that the questions are varied and cover different aspects. Let me list possible topics: the main function of the immune system, the scientist who coined the term, types of immunity, components of the immune system, mechanisms like phagocytosis, the difference between adaptive and innate immunity, the role of memory in immunity, the cause of autoimmune diseases, and the consequences of immunodeficiency.

Now, I should check the facts to make sure the answers are correct. For example, the immune system protects against pathogens, Ilya Mechnikov is the scientist, adaptive immunity includes memory, and immunodeficiency is when the system is underactive. Also, the immune system has both innate and adaptive parts.

I need to avoid repeating similar questions. For instance, the user already has a question about the two types of immunity, so I should focus on different aspects. Let me think of 10 distinct questions. Maybe include specific cells, mechanisms, and consequences. Also, check if the examples given in the user's message are already covered, but since they provided examples, I should avoid those and create new ones.

So, the questions could be:
1. What is the main function of the immune system?
2. Who is considered the father of immunology?
3. What are the two main types of immunity?
4. What is the process where the immune system creates memory to fight pathogens?
5. What is the term for when the immune system is underactive?
6. What are some mechanisms used by the immune system to detect pathogens?
7. Which cells are involved in the adaptive immune response?
8. What is the role of the complement system in the immune response?
9. What is the consequence of an overactive immune system attacking the body?
10. What are some examples of cells that are part of the immune system?

Now, I need to make sure each answer is correct based on the context. For example, the complement system is part of the innate immunity, and the adaptive includes B and T cells. The answer to question 6 should include phagocytosis, complement, and defensins. The answer to question 9 is autoimmune disease. Let me verify each answer against the provided context.

Yes, the context mentions that the immune system detects pathogens, Ilya Mechnikov is the father, adaptive and innate are the two types, memory is created through acquired immunity, immunodeficiency is the term for underactivity, mechanisms include phagocytosis, complement, defensins, and the overactive system causes autoimmune diseases. The cells mentioned are B cells, T cells, neutrophils, etc.

Now, I need to format them as CSV pairs, ensuring they are in Portuguese and follow the structure. No markdown, just the CSV with semicolons. Let me check for any possible mistakes. Make sure each question is clear and the answers are accurate. Alright, that should cover 10 distinct questions.
