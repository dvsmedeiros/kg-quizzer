Okay, I need to generate a CSV file with 10 question-answer pairs based on the provided context about the 1973 oil crisis. Let me go through this step by step.

First, I'll read the context carefully to understand the key points. The crisis started in October 1973 when OPAEP declared an embargo against countries supporting Israel during the Yom Kippur War. The initial target countries were Canada, Japan, Netherlands, UK, and USA, later expanding to Portugal, Rhodesia, and South Africa. The oil price increased from $3 to $12 per barrel, causing a global economic crisis known as the first oil shock, followed by another in 1979.

Next, I'll identify different aspects to cover: when it started, who was involved, which countries were targeted, price changes, effects on the economy, and related terms like "first oil shock" and comparison with later crises. Also, considering economic impacts and political actions makes sense.

Now, I'll draft questions ensuring they're varied and each has a single correct answer from the context. Let's list them:

1. When did the 1973 oil crisis begin?
2. Which organization imposed the embargo?
3. Why was the embargo imposed?
4. What countries were initially targeted?
5. How did the oil price change?
6. What effect did it have on the global economy?
7. What term is used for this event?
8. Were other crises similar later?
9. What were the economic consequences in Europe?
10. Which leader was involved politically?

I'll make sure each question is clear and answers are specific, avoiding overlaps. Now, I'll structure them into CSV format as instructed.
