Okay, so I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs based on the context of Geology. The user has specified that each pair should be in Portuguese and formatted as CSV with a semicolon separator.

First, I'll start by recalling key topics in Geology: types of rocks (igneous, sedimentary, metamorphic), tectonic plates, geological eras, minerals, the rock cycle, etc. These are fundamental areas to cover.

I need to make sure each question is unique and covers different aspects. For example, one about igneous rocks, another about tectonic boundaries, perhaps a question on geological time periods, and so on.

I should also ensure that each question has only one correct answer, which must be explicitly or implicitly supported by the context provided.

Let me think of some questions:

1. What type of rock is formed from cooled magma? Answer: Igneous.

2. Where does sedimentary rock form? Answer: Sedimentary basins.

3. How old is the Earth? About 4.6 billion years.

4. The process where rocks break down in place. That's weathering.

5. The oldest period of the Paleozoic era. Cambrian.

6. What connects tectonic plates? Mantle convection.

7. A metamorphic rock from basalt. Gneiss or perhaps marble if from limestone, but more likely gneiss.

8. Rock layers' study is called stratigraphy.

9. The hardest naturally occurring mineral is diamond.

10. In the water cycle, what's caused by wind? Waves.

Wait, I need to make sure each answer is correct and directly related to Geology. Let me double-check:

- Marble is a metamorphic rock from limestone (sedimentary), so maybe that's better than gneiss if considering basalt. Or perhaps not. Gneiss comes from granite or other rocks under heat and pressure.

Wait, the user's example had "gneisse" as a metamorphic rock from basalt. Is that accurate? Because basalt is an igneous rock. Under high heat and pressure, it can become gabbro, but more commonly, perhaps into something else. Maybe I should use marble instead if considering limestone.

But in the example, they used "gneisse" as the answer for a question about metamorphic rocks from basalt. So perhaps that's acceptable. Alternatively, maybe they meant a different rock.

I'll proceed with the initial thoughts and adjust if necessary to match common geological facts accurately.
