Okay, let's see. The user wants me to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the provided context and facts. The context is about the Black Death, so I need to make sure all the questions are relevant to that.

First, I'll read through the context again to identify key points. The main points are: the Black Death was the most devastating pandemic, killed 75-200 million people in Eurasia, peaked in Europe between 1347-1351, caused by Yersinia pestis, had different forms like bubonic, septicemic, and pneumonic, originated in Central or East Asia, spread via the Silk Road and fleas on rats in Genoese merchant ships, led to religious, social, and economic upheaval, killed 30-60% of Europe's population, reduced the world population from 475 million to 350-375 million in the 14th century, took Europe 200 years to recover, and it returned in outbreaks until the early 20th century.

Now, the facts section has a lot of RDF data, but the user emphasized using the context provided. The main info is in the context paragraph. I need to make sure the questions are based on that. Let me list possible topics: origin, time period, cause, spread, impact on population, economic and social effects, recurrence, the bacterium involved, the percentage of deaths in Europe, and the recovery time.

I need to avoid repeating similar questions. So, for example, if I ask about the time period, I can't have another question about the same period. Let me check each point:

1. Origin: Central or East Asia.
2. Time of peak in Europe: 1347-1351.
3. Cause: Yersinia pestis.
4. Spread: via Silk Road, fleas on rats in Genoese ships.
5. Impact on Europe's population: 30-60%.
6. World population reduction: 475M to 350-375M.
7. Recovery time for Europe: 200 years.
8. Recurrence: returned in outbreaks until early 20th century.
9. Forms of plague: bubonic, septicemic, pneumonic.
10. Economic and social effects: religious, social, economic upheaval.

That's 10 points. Now, I need to phrase each into a question and answer. Let me make sure each answer is directly from the context. For example, the question about the cause would be "Qual bactéria foi responsável pela Peste Negra?" and the answer is "Yersinia pestis."

Also, check for any possible overlaps. For example, the spread through the Silk Road and via ships is one point, but the question should be specific. Maybe one question about the origin and another about the method of spread.

I think that's covered. Now, structure each pair as per the CSV format with semicolons. Let me write them out one by one, ensuring they are varied and cover different aspects.
