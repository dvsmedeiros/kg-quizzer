Okay, I need to generate 10 pairs of questions and answers in CSV format based on the provided context and facts. Let me start by understanding the context thoroughly. The main topic is economic inequality, covering aspects like income distribution, wealth distribution, methods of measurement (like the Gini coefficient), and its effects on growth and globalization.

First, I should identify key concepts mentioned. The text talks about the Gini coefficient, the Human Development Index adjusted for inequality, and the difference between income and wealth. There's also mention of how globalization affects global inequality but increases inequality within countries. Additionally, there are references to various scholars and movements related to economic inequality.

Now, I need to create questions that cover different aspects. Let me list possible topics:

1. What are the two main measures of economic inequality mentioned?
2. Which index is used to measure inequality by considering both wealth and income?
3. What is the primary method used to measure economic inequality?
4. What is the effect of economic inequality on growth according to the text?
5. How does globalization affect global and national economic inequality?
6. What are two concepts related to equality that are mentioned?
7. Which scholar is associated with the study of economic inequality?
8. What is an example of a movement that is linked to economic inequality?
9. What is the term for the distribution of income versus the distribution of wealth?
10. What is the term for the equality of opportunities in the context of economic inequality?

I need to ensure each question is unique and covers different aspects. Let me check if these questions are based on the provided facts and context. The first question refers to the two measures: income and wealth. The second mentions the Human Development Index adjusted for inequality. The third is about the Gini coefficient. The fourth is about growth and inequality. The fifth is about globalization's effects. The sixth questions about concepts like equity, equality of results, and equality of opportunities. The seventh could be about a scholar like Branko Milanović. The eighth could reference an Occupy movement. The ninth is the difference between income and wealth distribution. The tenth is about equality of opportunities.

I need to make sure each answer is directly from the text. Let me verify each answer against the context. For example, the Gini coefficient is the most used method. The Human Development Index adjusted for inequality is mentioned. The effects of economic inequality on growth are that it doesn't affect the rate but the duration. Globalization reduces global inequality but increases within-country inequality. Concepts like equity, equality of results, and equality of opportunities are mentioned. Branko Milanović is a scholar in the field. Occupy movements are linked to economic inequality. The difference between income and wealth distribution is a key point. Equality of opportunities is a concept mentioned.

I should structure each question and answer pair correctly, ensuring they are in Portuguese and follow the CSV format. Let me check for any repetition or overlap. Each question should be distinct. Now, I'll format them as per the instructions.
