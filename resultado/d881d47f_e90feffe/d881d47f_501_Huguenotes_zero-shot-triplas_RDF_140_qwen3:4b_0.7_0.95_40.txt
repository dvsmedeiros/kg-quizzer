Okay, the user wants me to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the provided context about the Huguenots. Let me start by understanding the context thoroughly.

The context mentions that Huguenots were French Protestants during the religious wars in the late 16th century. They left France after the persecution under Louis XIV and the revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685. They were mostly Calvinists in the Reformed Church, while some in Alsace, Moselle, and Montbéliard were Lutheran.

Now, I need to create varied questions that cover different aspects. Let me list possible topics: origin, religious beliefs, historical events, migration, cultural impact, etc. I need to ensure each question is unique and directly related to the content.

First, the origin: What were the Huguenots? Answer: They were French Protestants during the religious wars.

Next, their religious affiliation: What religion were they primarily associated with? Answer: Calvinism.

Then, the Edict of Nantes: When was it revoked? Answer: 1685.

Persecution under Louis XIV: Who was the king associated with their persecution? Answer: Louis XIV.

Migration: How many Huguenots left France? Answer: About 300,000.

Geographic regions: Which regions had Lutheran Huguenots? Answer: Alsace, Moselle, Montbéliard.

Historical significance: What event led to their migration? Answer: The revocation of the Edict of Nantes and persecution.

Cultural impact: Where are they named after? Answer: Huguenots in places like Orange County, New York, and Staten Island.

Legacy: What is a notable symbol of the Huguenots? Answer: The Huguenot cross.

Historical events: What was the Massacre of the Saint Bartholomew? Answer: A屠杀事件 associated with the religious conflicts.

Wait, I need to make sure all answers are based on the provided context. Let me check each answer against the facts given. Also, avoid repeating similar questions. For example, the Edict of Nantes and its revocation are related, so I can ask about the revocation date and the king's name. The migration number and the regions with Lutheran Huguenots are covered. The cultural impact and symbols are also included.

I think that's 10 questions. Let me structure them in CSV format without any extra text. Make sure each pair is separated by a semicolon and the language is Portuguese. Double-check the answers for accuracy based on the context provided.
