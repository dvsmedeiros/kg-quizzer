Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs based on the provided data about Fresno, California. Let me start by reviewing the examples given to understand the pattern. The examples include questions about population, geography, history, and notable features. The answers are concise and directly derived from the data.

First, I'll look through the data to identify key points. The population stats mention a population of 1008654 in the metro area, with a demonym "Fresnan." The area is 300.43 km² with a high population density. There's historical info about the Central Pacific Railroad establishing a station in 1872, and Fresno becoming a city in 1885. The Fresno Traction Company operated 47 streetcars in 1931. Also, the city's nickname is "The Gem of the San Joaquin Valley," and the seal has a willow tree.

Now, I need to form questions that are factual and based on these details. Let me brainstorm possible questions:

1. What is the population of the Fresno metropolitan area? (Answer: 1,008,654)
2. What is the population density of Fresno in square kilometers? (Answer: 1823.43)
3. Which railroad established a station in Fresno in 1872? (Answer: Central Pacific Railroad)
4. When did Fresno become an incorporated city? (Answer: 1885)
5. How many streetcars did the Fresno Traction Company operate in 1931? (Answer: 47)
6. What is the nickname of Fresno? (Answer: The Gem of the San Joaquin Valley)
7. What is the demonym for residents of Fresno? (Answer: Fresnan)
8. What does the willow tree symbolize on Fresno's seal? (Answer: The willow tree is part of the city's seal, representing the area's natural features.)
9. What is the total area of Fresno in square kilometers? (Answer: 300.43)
10. What is the name of the annual fair held in Fresno? (Answer: The Big Fresno Fair)

Wait, the Big Fresno Fair is mentioned in the data, so that's a good question. Also, the seal's willow tree is a key feature. Let me check if all these answers are present in the data. The population metro is 1,008,654. The population density is 1823.43 per km². The Central Pacific Railroad is mentioned in 1872. Fresno became a city in 1885. The Traction Company had 47 streetcars. The nickname is "The Gem of the San Joaquin Valley." The demonym is "Fresnan." The total area is 300.43 km². The Big Fresno Fair is listed as an event. The seal's willow tree is part of the city's symbol.

I need to make sure the answers are accurate and directly from the data. Also, the questions should be in Portuguese, following the examples. Let me structure them properly.
