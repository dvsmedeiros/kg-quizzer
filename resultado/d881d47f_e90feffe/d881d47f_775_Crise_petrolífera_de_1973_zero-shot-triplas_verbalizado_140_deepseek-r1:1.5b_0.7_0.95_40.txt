Okay, let me try to figure out how to generate these 10 pairs of questions and answers based on the given context about the 1973 oil crisis. First, I need to understand what exactly is required. The user wants a CSV with two columns: "pergunta" and "resposta," each containing one question and its correct answer. The responses should be in Portuguese.

Looking at the provided context, it's pretty detailed about how the crisis started, affected countries like Canada, Japan, Germany, the USA, etc., and the price fluctuations over time. There are also several images linked that represent aspects of the oil prices and their impact on the economy. 

Now, I need to think of different angles from which to approach the 1973 oil crisis within a Portuguese context. Each question should be original but relevant to the information provided. For example:

1. How did Canada respond to the oil price increases? This ties into specific economic responses and can lead to an answer about their action against the crisis.

2. What were Germany's actions regarding foreign oil supplies after the crisis? That connects with Germany's response during the crisis and its aftermath, which is a common question about supply chain issues.

3. How did the US adjust its production methods post-crisis? This could involve answers related to transitioning to renewables or energy efficiency measures.

4. Was Portugal involved in international oil trade after the crisis? Yes, they engaged with countries like Germany and Japan, so questions about their involvement and specific actions would make sense.

5. What was the impact of foreign oil supplies on the US economy during the crisis? This ties into how imports affected prices and the overall economic situation.

6. How did Japan's trade policies change after the crisis? They might reduce import competition or adjust their supply strategies, so questions about their response to trade deficits would fit.

7. Was Germany involved in international oil production post-crisis? Yes, they increased production through activities like the Crude Oil Production and Imports project.

8. What was the role of Canada in international oil supply after the crisis? They provided supplies to countries that needed them for energy needs.

9. How did Germany adjust their import policies post-crisis? This could involve more stringent imports or diversifying sources, leading to specific answers about their strategies.

10. What affected other European countries' oil production during the crisis? This ties into how each country's supply was impacted by the global crisis.

Each of these questions is tied back to the information provided in the context, ensuring relevance and accuracy. I need to make sure that each answer is clear, concise, and directly related to a fact or event from the context. Also, it's important to keep the answers neutral and straightforward without adding any extra information beyond what's already given.

Now, let me draft these questions one by one, making sure they are varied and cover different aspects of the oil crisis. I'll also verify that each response is correct and directly corresponds to a fact from the context.
