pergunta;resposta
Wait, but the user mentioned "10 pares pergunta;resposta" which means 10 pairs. So I need to make sure I generate exactly 10. Let me check the data again. The University of Chicago has several entries, and there are many individuals listed with various predicates. Each individual's data can be a question, but I need to avoid repetition.
