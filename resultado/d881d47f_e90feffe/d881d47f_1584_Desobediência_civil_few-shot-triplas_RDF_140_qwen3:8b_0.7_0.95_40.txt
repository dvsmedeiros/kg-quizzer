Okay, the user wants me to generate 10 CSV pairs of questions and answers based on the provided context and facts about civil disobedience. Let me start by understanding the context and facts given.

First, the context explains that civil disobedience is a peaceful form of protest against unjust laws or oppressive governments, with examples like Gandhi's independence movement and Martin Luther King's civil rights efforts. The facts include various historical events and protests that used civil disobedience, like the 1998 Russian miners' strike, 2015 Montenegrin crisis, and others.

I need to create 10 varied questions covering different aspects. Let me list out the key points from the context and facts:

1. Originators: Henry David Thoreau, Mahatma Gandhi, Martin Luther King.
2. Definition: Peaceful protest against unjust laws or oppressive governments.
3. Examples: Indian independence, US civil rights movement, End SARS protests, etc.
4. Key events mentioned in the facts: Russian miners' strike, Montenegrin crisis, Albanian protests, Serbian protests, Iranian protests, etc.
5. Philosophical aspect: Resistance against unjust laws, nonviolent resistance.

Now, I need to form questions that cover these points without repetition. Let me think of possible questions:

- Who is considered the originator of the concept?
- What is civil disobedience defined as?
- Which historical movement used civil disobedience?
- What was the purpose of the 2019 Montenegrin anti-corruption protests?
- Which event is an example of civil disobedience in the US?
- What did the 2017 Serbian protests oppose?
- Who was a key figure in the civil rights movement using this method?
- What is an example of civil disobedience in the context of anti-corruption?
- Which movement used civil disobedience against the compulsory hijab in Iran?
- What is the primary goal of civil disobedience as per the context?

I need to ensure each question is unique and covers different aspects. Now, check if the answers are directly inferable from the context. For example, the answer to the first question is Henry David Thoreau. The second question's answer is the definition provided. The third could be the Indian independence movement. The fourth might be the 2019 Montenegrin anti-corruption protests. The fifth could be the US civil rights movement. The sixth might be the 2017 Serbian protests opposing government actions. The seventh is Martin Luther King. The eighth is the 2019 Montenegrin anti-corruption protests. The ninth is the Iranian protests against the compulsory hijab. The tenth is resisting unjust laws.

Wait, I need to make sure the answers are correct. Let me cross-verify with the facts. The facts mention the 2019 Montenegrin anti-corruption protests using civil disobedience. The Iranian protests against compulsory hijab are also listed. The 2017 Serbian protests are mentioned. The US civil rights movement is in the context. Martin Luther King is mentioned. Henry David Thoreau is the originator. The definition is given in the context. The answer to the first question should be Henry David Thoreau. The answer to the second is the peaceful protest against unjust laws or oppressive governments. Third, the Indian independence movement. Fourth, the 2019 Montenegrin anti-corruption protests. Fifth, the US civil rights movement. Sixth, the 2017 Serbian protests opposing government actions. Seventh, Martin Luther King. Eighth, the 2019 Montenegrin anti-corruption protests. Ninth, the Iranian protests against compulsory hijab. Tenth, resisting unjust laws.

Now, structure these into 10 questions and answers, ensuring they are clear and concise. Check for repetition and ensure each question is distinct. Then format them as CSV pairs, separating with semicolons. Make sure the answers are accurate based on the provided information.
