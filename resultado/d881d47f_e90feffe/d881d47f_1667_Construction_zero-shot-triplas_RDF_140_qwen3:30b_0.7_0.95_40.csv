pergunta;resposta
The instruction says to generate questions and answers. The questions should be in Portuguese; and the answers should be concise. Let me think of possible questions:
   - The hypernym of Construction is Process; so maybe mention that Construction is a type of Process.
    - The templates listed like "Template:Center;" "Template:GBR" might be part of the Wikipedia page for Construction.
Finally; check for 10 unique pairs. Let me draft them now.
