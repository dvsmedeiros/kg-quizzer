Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to generate 10 pairs of questions and answers in CSV format based on the given context and facts about the 1973 oil crisis. The key points are that the questions must be varied, relevant, and each has a single correct answer derived from the provided content. No repetition of similar questions, and only the CSV output is needed.

First, I need to thoroughly understand the context provided. The 1973 oil crisis started in October 1973 when OPEC (specifically Arab members) imposed an embargo on countries supporting Israel during the Yom Kippur War. The target countries included the US, Japan, etc. The oil price skyrocketed from $3 to $12 per barrel, leading to a global economic crisis known as the first oil shock, followed by the 1979 crisis.

Now, looking at the facts provided, there are a lot of technical terms and categories, but the main points are the embargo, the countries involved, the price increase, the impact, and the subsequent crises. The user also provided examples, which I should follow in terms of structure and content.

I need to make sure each question is unique and covers different aspects. Let's brainstorm possible questions:

1. When did the 1973 oil crisis begin? (Answer: October 1973)
2. Which organization imposed the embargo? (Answer: OPEC, specifically Arab members)
3. Which countries were targeted initially? (Answer: Canada, Japan, Netherlands, UK, US)
4. How much did oil prices rise? (Answer: From $3 to $12 per barrel)
5. What was the name given to the 1973 crisis? (Answer: First oil shock)
6. When did the embargo end? (Answer: March 1974)
7. What was the reason for the embargo? (Answer: Support for Israel during Yom Kippur War)
8. Which subsequent crisis followed? (Answer: 1979 crisis, second oil shock)
9. What was the impact on the US? (Answer: Prices were even higher)
10. What was the effect on the global economy? (Answer: Crisis, "shock" with short and long-term effects)

Wait, the user's examples include questions about the second crisis, the embargo reasons, and specific events. I need to ensure that the questions are not overlapping and cover different aspects. Let me check the facts again to make sure the answers are accurate.

For example, the context mentions the embargo was directed at countries supporting Israel during the Yom Kippur War. The target countries are listed as Canada, Japan, Netherlands, UK, US, then expanded to Portugal, Rhodesia, and South Africa. The price increase is from $3 to $12, with US prices higher. The first oil shock, followed by the 1979 crisis.

Also, the facts include various categories and models, but those might not be directly relevant unless the user's context mentions them. Since the user's examples focus on the embargo, countries, price changes, and effects, I should stick to those.

I need to avoid repeating similar questions. For instance, don't ask about the same country multiple times. Let me structure the 10 questions:

1. When did the 1973 oil crisis start? (October 1973)
2. Which organization imposed the oil embargo? (OPEC, specifically Arab members)
3. Which countries were initially targeted by the embargo? (Canada, Japan, Netherlands, UK, USA)
4. What was the price increase of oil during the crisis? (From $3 to $12 per barrel)
5. What is the name given to the 1973 crisis? (First oil shock)
6. When did the embargo end? (March 1974)
7. Why was the embargo imposed? (Support for Israel during Yom Kippur War)
8. What was the next major oil crisis after 1973? (1979 crisis, second oil shock)
9. How did the crisis affect the US? (Prices were higher than other regions)
10. What was the global impact of the crisis? (Economic and political effects, "shock" with short and long-term consequences)

I need to verify that each answer is directly from the context. For example, the context says "o preço do petróleo subiu de US$ 3 por barril para cerca de US$ 12 no mundo inteiro; Os preços nos EUA foram ainda mais altos." So the US prices were higher. Also, the embargo ended in March 1974. The second crisis was in 1979.

Now, converting these into questions in Portuguese, ensuring they are clear and concise. Check for any possible overlaps or repetition. Make sure each question is distinct and the answers are accurate based on the context provided.
