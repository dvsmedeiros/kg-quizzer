Okay, so I need to create 10 pairs of questions and answers based on the context provided. Let's start by understanding what information is given. The Universidade de Chicago is mentioned in a detailed way, including its institution, location, some statistics like the number of schools it has, the number of divisions of research, the number of students, notable figures, and so on.

First, I need to extract relevant pieces of information that can be turned into questions. From the context, I see terms like "Universidade de Chicago," "escola profissional," "pés locais," "divisões de pesquisa acadêmica," etc.

I should come up with a variety of questions covering different aspects. Let me think of some:

1. What institution does the Universidade de Chicago belong to? That seems straightforward.
2. Who was the first president of the Universidade de Chicago?
3. How many schools does it have in Brazil?
4. Which school is located in São Paulo?
5. Where is the largest university in Brazil?
6. What are the main divisions of research at the University of Chicago?
7. Who established the Divisões de Pesquisa Nacionais do UCC?
8. Where is the largest department of mathematics and statistics at the university?
9. What institution was founded by Thomas Hargobin?
10. Which city in Brazil is home to the largest bank?

Now, I'll make sure each question is clear and corresponds to a fact from the context. Each answer should be concise and directly tied to the information provided. Let me verify that all 10 pairs are correctly formatted as comma-separated strings without any additional text.

I think this covers different areas: institution membership, history, geography, departments, notable figures, and statistics. I've included both specific schools and broader divisions to show a range of knowledge from the Universidade de Chicago.
