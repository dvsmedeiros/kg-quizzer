Okay, the user wants me to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the provided context and facts about the Yuan Dynasty. Let me start by understanding the context and the key points given.

The Yuan Dynasty was established by Kublai Khan, a grandson of Genghis Khan, in 1271. It's a Mongol dynasty that ruled China, and there's a lot of information about its history, key events, people, and related events. The user provided a list of facts that I need to use to create varied questions.

First, I need to make sure each question is unique and covers different aspects. Let's look through the facts to find different angles. The facts mention the establishment year, the founder, key events like the Mongol conquest of the Song dynasty, the fall in 1368, important people like Kublai Khan and Temür Khan, events such as the Red Turban Rebellion, and various locations and cultural elements.

I should avoid repeating the same topics. For example, one question could be about the founder, another about the establishment year, another about the capital, and so on. Also, the user mentioned events like the Battle of Xiangyang and the Battle of Bạch Đằng. These can be used to create questions about military conflicts.

I need to ensure that each answer is directly derived from the provided facts. For example, if the fact says "Yuan dynasty was dissolved in 1368," the question could be "Em que ano a dinastia Yuan foi dissolvida?" with the answer being 1368.

I should check for different categories: historical events, people, places, dates, cultural aspects, etc. Let me list out possible questions:

1. Who founded the Yuan Dynasty?
2. In which year was the Yuan Dynasty established?
3. What was the capital of the Yuan Dynasty?
4. Which significant battle involved the Yuan Dynasty?
5. Who was the last emperor of the Yuan Dynasty?
6. What event marked the end of the Yuan Dynasty?
7. What was the name of the capital city established by Kublai Khan?
8. Which rebellion occurred during the Yuan Dynasty?
9. What was the name of the calendar used during the Yuan Dynasty?
10. What was the name of the Mongol Empire's name during the Yuan Dynasty?

Wait, but some of these might not be accurate. Let me verify. The Yuan Dynasty was established in 1271, and the capital was Khanbaliq. The last emperor was Tugh Temür. The Battle of Xiangyang was a significant battle. The Red Turban Rebellion was a rebellion during the Yuan. The calendar is "Time Granting Calendar." The Mongol Empire's name during the Yuan was "Great Yuan."

I need to make sure all these are covered in the facts. The user provided that the Yuan Dynasty was dissolved in 1368, and the last emperor was Tugh Temür. The Battle of Xiangyang is mentioned, as well as the Red Turban Rebellion. The calendar is mentioned as "Time Granting Calendar."

So, these 10 questions should be covered. Let me structure them into the CSV format, making sure each question is unique and the answer is correct based on the facts provided. Also, check that the answers are not repeated and each question is from different aspects.
