Okay, so the user wants me to create a list of 10 questions about Fresno, California using this specific schema and provided information. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I need to understand the structure of the Fresno database. It includes details like location, population, area, map information, etc. The instructions mention creating questions in pairs where each question has a corresponding response, so probably 10 questions would mean 5 pairs or something.

Looking at the provided data, there are quite a few people and places associated with Fresno. Maybe I can create questions that ask about different aspects like the population, notable landmarks, economic figures, etc.

I should start by identifying key points from the data. The population is given as around 1008654, so maybe one question about the population estimate. Then, the number of residents could be a separate question.

Looking at the people section, there are details like Paula McLain and Tom Terry, but since the user wants pairs, perhaps I can ask questions about their roles or other aspects related to Fresno's economy or cultural significance.

I should ensure that each pair makes sense and covers different areas of Fresno. Maybe one on population statistics, another on economic figures, then some on cultural or historical mentions.

Wait, the list also includes people like Tom Terry as a meteorologist and others in various fields. Maybe I can ask about their professions to show diversity.

I need to make sure each question is clear and directly related to the data provided. Also, since the user wants the response in pairs, maybe they plan to use these in some application where questions are answered together.

Let me go through each point and think of a logical question. The population figure is 10 million, so one question about that. Then, who owns the library? That would be another question with a number. 

Looking at the economy section, the unemployment rate and median income come to mind as questions. Also, the number of businesses could be asked about.

I should include both male and female names in some questions, like Daryl Scullery asking for his name and Mike Johnson's phone number. This adds variety to the responses.

Including notable people like Tom Terry or Tom Scaver can provide context on Fresno's community. Maybe one question about Tom Terry's career and another about Tom Scaver's contributions.

I think I have a good outline now, making sure each point is covered in both a question and its response, focusing on different aspects of Fresno's life.
