Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the provided context and facts about Fresno, California. Let me start by understanding the context and the facts given.

The context mentions that Fresno is the fifth most populous city in California, incorporated in 1885, with a population over 542,000 as of the 2020 census, ranking it as the 34th most populous city in the US. The facts list various people born or died in Fresno, along with sports teams, landmarks, and other geographical data.

I need to create questions that cover different aspects: population, incorporation date, city status, notable people, sports teams, landmarks, and other related facts. Let me check the facts again to ensure the questions are based on the given information.

First, I can ask about the population as of the 2020 census. That's a direct fact. Then, the incorporation date. Next, the city's ranking as the fifth most populous in California. Then, the city's status as the county seat of Fresno County.

For notable people, there's Chris McNealy, George N. Zenovich, and others. I can ask who was born in Fresno. Also, the 2020 census population number. Then, the type of the city (SocialGroup107950920). Another fact is the area total in square meters and square kilometers. Also, the metropolitan population. Maybe the name of the fair in Fresno, The Big Fresno Fair. And the area of the city in square kilometers.

Wait, I need to make sure each question is unique and covers different aspects. Let me list possible questions:

1. What is the population of Fresno, California according to the 2020 census?
2. When was Fresno, California incorporated?
3. What is the rank of Fresno, California in terms of population in the United States?
4. What is the name of the fair located in Fresno, California?
5. What is the area of Fresno, California in square kilometers according to the data?
6. What is the type of Fresno, California as per the given data?
7. Who was born in Fresno, California according to the facts?
8. What is the metropolitan population of Fresno, California?
9. What is the name of the airport that serves Fresno, California?
10. What is the name of the city that is the county seat of Fresno County?

I need to check if these questions are based on the facts provided. For example, the fair is The Big Fresno Fair. The airport is Fresno Yosemite International Airport. The county seat is Fresno, which is the same city. Wait, but the county seat is a city, so that's correct.

Also, the area in square kilometers is 300.43. The metropolitan population is 1,008,654. The type of the city is SocialGroup107950920. The incorporation date is October 12, 1885. The population in 2020 is 542,000. The rank in the US is 34th. The fifth most populous in California.

I need to make sure the questions are correctly formulated and the answers are accurate. Let me check each one again.

Yes, these should cover different aspects. Now, I need to present them in CSV format with the correct separators and language.
