Looking at the area land, it's 1935.5 square kilometers (since the value is 1935498000.0, but that might be in square meters, so converting to square kilometers would be 1935.5). Wait, the data says "ns2:areaLand "1935498000.0" ;" which is in square meters, so converting to square kilometers is 1935.498 km². That's a possible question about the area.
The data also lists some historical events like the Skirmish at Cedar Creek, but that might not be directly related to Jacksonville. Wait, no, the Skirmish at Cedar Creek is listed under places, but I need to check if that's correct. However, the data says "ns2:place <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jacksonville,_Florida> ;" for Skirmish at Cedar Creek, which might be a mistake. But since the user provided that, maybe it's a point to include. However, the example doesn't have that, so maybe it's better to focus on the more straightforward facts.
The population rank is 1 in Florida, but the example already asks about that. However, the question could also be about the population rank in the United States, but the data doesn't provide that. The example mentions that Jacksonville is 12th in the U.S. based on population, but that's from the example, not the data. Wait, the user's example includes a question about the ranking in the U.S., which is 12th, but the data provided doesn't explicitly state that. The data only has "populationRank "1" ;" which is for Florida. So the 12th rank in the U.S. might be from the example, not the data. However, the user's instruction says to base the answers strictly on the provided data. So I need to avoid including information not present in the data.
Looking again, the data includes "ns1:blankName <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Federal_Information_Processing_Standard> ;" but that's unclear. Maybe not useful.
The data also has "ns1:wikiPageUsesTemplate <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Template:Reflist>, <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Template:Start_date_and_age> ;" but that's about templates used, not useful for questions.
The official name is "City of Jacksonville and Duval County," which is a unique fact not covered in the example. The example mentions the official name as "City of Jacksonville and Duval County" but the user's example has a question about the official name. Wait, the user's example includes a question: "Qual é o nome da colônia francesa fundada em 1564?;Fort Caroline," which is in Portuguese. The official name question is not in the example. So that's a valid question.
Now, checking for duplicates. The example already includes the population rank, consolidation year, river name, Fort Caroline, and Andrew Jackson. So the new questions would be 1, 2, 3, 4, 10. But the user's example has "Qual era a população da cidade de Jacksonville em 2010?;1.345.596" which is in Portuguese, but the user's instruction is to generate in Portuguese as well, since the examples are in Portuguese. Wait, the user provided the initial data in Portuguese and the examples in Portuguese. The user's final instruction is to generate the 10 pairs in Portuguese. So the questions need to be in Portuguese. Let me adjust that.
