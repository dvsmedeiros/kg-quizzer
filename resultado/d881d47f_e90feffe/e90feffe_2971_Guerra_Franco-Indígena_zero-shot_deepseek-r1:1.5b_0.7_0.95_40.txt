Okay, the user wants me to create a quiz focusing on "Guerra_Franco-Indígena." They specified 10 pairs with specific formatting. First, I need to identify relevant facts and events that fall under this context.

I should cover various aspects like historical incidents, cultural impacts, economic changes, social movements, and social issues. Each of these will serve as a different question with clear answers.

Let me list out some key points: The 1980 coup was a major event, the independence movement had significant political effects, infrastructure projects affected the economy, social programs were impactful, and social unrest is still prevalent.

Now, I'll translate each fact into a question. For example, "Quem fez o cálideu da guerra?" translates to "Who caused the coup?" Then, I'll provide the corresponding response for each question.

I need to ensure that each answer is clear and directly relates to the context without needing additional explanations. Separating them into a CSV format with the specified separators will meet the user's requirements.

Claro que o usuário está procurando uma nova opção de questão, mas, como não conheço se você está procurando出于 de necessidade ou para usar em um arquivo que já está existente, sugiro que possam me exibir o contexto original ou a área específica em que desejo adicionar.
