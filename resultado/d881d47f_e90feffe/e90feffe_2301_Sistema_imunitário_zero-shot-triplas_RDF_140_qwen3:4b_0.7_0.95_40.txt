Okay, the user wants me to generate 10 objective questions and answers in CSV format based on the provided context about the immune system. Let me start by understanding the context thoroughly.

The context explains the immune system's role in protecting the body, its components, the work of Ilya Mechnikov, different mechanisms like phagocytosis, defensins, complement, and the distinction between adaptive and innate immunity. It also mentions diseases like autoimmune disorders and immunodeficiency, and the role of vaccination.

Now, I need to create 10 unique questions that cover various aspects of this information. Let me list the key points from the context:

1. The term "immune system" was coined by Ilya Mechnikov in 1882.
2. The immune system detects and distinguishes between pathogens and the body's own tissues.
3. Mechanisms include phagocytosis, defensins, and the complement system.
4. Vertebrates have complex defenses, including adaptive immunity with memory.
5. Autoimmune diseases occur when the immune system attacks the body.
6. Immunodeficiency is when the system is underactive, leading to infections.
7. The immune system is studied in immunology.
8. Components like B cells, T cells, macrophages, etc., are part of the system.
9. Vaccination is based on adaptive immunity.
10. The immune system is present in unicellular organisms as well.

I need to make sure each question is unique and covers different aspects. Let me brainstorm possible questions:

1. Who coined the term "immune system"?
2. What is the main function of the immune system?
3. What are the basic mechanisms of the immune system in unicellular organisms?
4. What is the role of the complement system?
5. What is the difference between adaptive and innate immunity?
6. What is an example of an autoimmune disease?
7. What is immunodeficiency, and what can cause it?
8. How does vaccination work in relation to the immune system?
9. What are some components of the immune system?
10. What is the study of the immune system called?

Now, I need to check if these questions are based on the provided facts and ensure they are accurate. The context mentions Ilya Mechnikov, the main function of detecting pathogens, mechanisms like phagocytosis, defensins, and complement. Adaptive immunity includes memory, and vaccination is part of that. Autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis are mentioned. Immunodeficiency is due to genetic, HIV, or immunosuppressants. Components include B cells, T cells, macrophages. Immunology is the study.

I should make sure each question has a correct answer from the context. Also, avoid repeating similar questions. Let me structure them into the CSV format as specified, with each pair separated by a semicolon and in Portuguese. Also, check for any possible errors in the facts. For example, the complement system is mentioned, so the answer should include that. The answer to the question about the study of the immune system is immunology. The answer to the question about the main function is detecting pathogens and distinguishing them from the body's own tissues.

I think that's all. Now, I'll format them into the CSV as required.
