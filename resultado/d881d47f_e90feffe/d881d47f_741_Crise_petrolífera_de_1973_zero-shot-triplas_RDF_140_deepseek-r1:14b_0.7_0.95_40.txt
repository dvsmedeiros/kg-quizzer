Okay, so I've been given a task to generate 10 question-answer pairs based on the context provided about the 1973 oil crisis. The user has specified that these should be in CSV format with each line containing a question and its correct answer, separated by a semicolon.

First, I need to understand the content thoroughly. The context explains that the 1973 oil crisis started when Arab countries imposed an embargo on certain nations supporting Israel during the Yom Kippur War. This led to a significant increase in oil prices and had various economic and political impacts globally. It's also noted as the first oil shock, followed by another in 1979.

Now, I have to create varied questions that cover different aspects of this event. The user emphasized not repeating similar questions and ensuring each has a unique correct answer. I should extract information from both the textual context and the RDF facts provided.

Looking at the RDF data, it includes categories like Arab-Israeli conflict, embargoes, energy crises, etc., which can be sources for questions about causes, effects, participants, and outcomes.

I need to think of different angles: when did it start? Which countries were involved? What were the economic impacts? How did it affect politics?

I should also consider that some facts are inferred. For example, while the text mentions the embargo's targets, I can infer questions about which countries weren't targeted or how prices changed in specific regions.

Another point is to ensure each question is clear and directly tied to the content. I'll need to avoid any ambiguity in the answers so they're unambiguously correct based on what's provided.

I also notice that the user wants exactly 10 pairs, so I must make sure not to exceed or fall short of this number. Each entry should be a new line in the CSV without any additional commentary.

Finally, after drafting all questions and answers, I'll format them correctly, ensuring proper CSV syntax with semicolons as separators.
