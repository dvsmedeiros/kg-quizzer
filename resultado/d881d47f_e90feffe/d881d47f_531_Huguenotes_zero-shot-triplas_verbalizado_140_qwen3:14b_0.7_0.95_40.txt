Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the provided context and facts. Let me start by carefully reading through the context and facts to identify key points that can form the basis of questions.

The context mentions Huguenots as French Protestants during the religious wars in the late 16th century. It notes that around 300,000 left France due to persecution under Louis XIV and the revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685. They were mainly Calvinists, while some regions had Lutheran German-speaking Protestants.

Looking at the facts, there's a lot about Wikipedia templates, images, categories, and places named after Huguenots like Orange County, New York, and Staten Island. There's also mention of related groups like Scotch-Irish Americans and historical events such as the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre.

I need to ensure that each question is unique and covers different aspects. Possible topics could be the reasons for migration, religious affiliations, historical events, places named after them, related groups, and specific images or categories associated with Huguenots.

Now, I'll draft questions one by one, making sure each answer is directly from the provided information. For example, the number of Huguenots who left France, their religious affiliation, the Edict of Nantes, places named after them, and related terms like Camisard.

I should avoid repeating similar questions and ensure that each answer is accurate and based solely on the given text. Let me check for any overlaps or missed points. Once I have 10 distinct questions, I'll format them into CSV as specified.
