Okay, the user wants me to generate 10 pairs of questions and answers in CSV format based on the provided context and facts. Let me start by understanding the context given.

The main topic is "Civil disobedience," which is a form of peaceful political protest against unjust laws or oppressive governments. It was originally formulated by Henry David Thoreau and later used by Gandhi, Martin Luther King, etc. The facts listed include various examples of movements and events that use civil disobedience, like the 2021 End SARS protests, the 1998 Russian miners' strike, the 2019 Montenegrin anti-corruption protests, and others. There are also mentions of specific people and organizations linked to civil disobedience, such as Tony Milligan, Ruckus Society, and the Women in the Yellow Vests movement.

Now, I need to create 10 unique questions that cover different aspects of this topic. The questions should be varied, not repeating the same topic. The answers need to be directly from the context or inferable from the given facts. Let me list possible questions and check if they are covered in the facts.

First, the definition of civil disobedience. Then, who formulated it? Then, who used it in notable movements? Examples of events using it. Also, the connection to specific people, organizations, or concepts like nonviolence, activism, etc. I need to make sure each question is distinct and the answer is correctly derived from the context.

Let me start by drafting the first question. "Quem formulou o conceito de desobediência civil?" The answer is Henry David Thoreau. That's covered in the context.

Next, "Quais movimentos utilizaram a desobediência civil?" The answer could be Gandhi, Martin Luther King, etc. But the context mentions specific events, so maybe list some examples like the Indian independence movement, the Civil Rights Movement in the US.

Another question could be about the purpose of civil disobedience, which is to protest against unjust laws or oppressive governments. The context says that the government has the right to be disobeyed if it doesn't meet the population's demands.

Then, examples of events: End SARS 2021, the 1998 Russian miners' strike, the 2019 Montenegrin anti-corruption protests, etc. Need to pick different ones each time.

Also, the connection to nonviolence and activism. The context mentions Category:Nonviolence and Category:Activism by type.

Another point is the use of specific organizations or groups, like Ruckus Society, which has products related to civil disobedience. Also, the Women in the Yellow Vests movement.

I need to ensure that each question is unique and not repeating the same topic. For example, one question about the concept, another about the originator, another about the purpose, another about examples, another about the connection to nonviolence, another about the use of specific movements, another about the role of specific individuals, another about the use of the term in different contexts, another about the categories associated, and another about the examples of events.

I should check that each answer is directly from the context. For example, "Quem é conhecido por desobediência civil?" The answer is Veliyankode Umar Khasi. Also, "Qual é o principal interesse de Tony Milligan?" The answer is Civil disobedience.

I need to avoid repeating the same event or person. Let me make sure each question is distinct. Let's see:

1. Who formulated the concept? Thoreau
2. Who used it in notable movements? Gandhi, MLK
3. What is the purpose? Protest against unjust laws
4. What is an example of an event? 2021 End SARS
5. What is an example of a movement? 1998 Russian miners' strike
6. What is the connection to nonviolence? It's part of nonviolence
7. What is the main interest of Tony Milligan? Civil disobedience
8. What is the main topic of the page? Civil disobedience
9. Which movement uses civil disobedience? Women in the Yellow Vests
10. What is the category associated? Category:Activism by type

Wait, but I need to make sure that the answers are correct based on the provided facts. Let me check each fact again.

The context says that civil disobedience is a form of peaceful protest against unjust laws or oppressive governments. Henry David Thoreau formulated it, and Gandhi used it in India, Martin Luther King in the US. Examples include End SARS 2021, 1998 Russian miners, 2019 Montenegrin anti-corruption, etc. Veliyankode Umar Khasi is known for it. Tony Milligan's main interest is civil disobedience. The main topic is civil disobedience. The category is Activism by type. Women in the Yellow Vests uses it. The category is Nonviolence.

Yes, that's covered. So I can create the questions accordingly. Now, I need to make sure that each question is unique and the answers are correct.
