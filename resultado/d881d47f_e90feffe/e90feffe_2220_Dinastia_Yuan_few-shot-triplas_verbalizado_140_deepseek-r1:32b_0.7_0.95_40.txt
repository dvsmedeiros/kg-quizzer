Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs about the Yuan dynasty based on the provided context and facts. Let me start by understanding what information is available.

First, from the context, the Yuan dynasty was established in 1271 by Kublai Khan, who was a grandson of Genghis Khan. It's a Mongol lineage ruling over China. The dynasty fell in 1368.

Looking at the facts provided, there are several key points:

- Kublai Khan founded the Yuan dynasty.
- The capital was Shangdu and later Khanbaliq.
- The dynasty used Chinese as a common language.
- It lasted until 1368 when it was dissolved.
- There were several important figures like Temür Khan, Külüg Khan, and others who were part of the Yuan dynasty.

Now, I need to create varied questions covering different aspects. Let me think about possible angles:

1. Founder: Who established the Yuan dynasty?
2. Capital cities: What were its capitals?
3. Duration: When was it established and dissolved?
4. Official name in Chinese: What's the official name?
5. Successors/Predecessors: Which dynasty came after?
6. Language used: What language was commonly spoken?
7. Key figures: Who were notable leaders or people associated with it?
8. Important events: Any significant battles or rebellions during its rule?
9. Territories: Did it expand beyond China?
10. Cultural aspects: Were there any notable cultural developments?

Wait, but looking back at the facts, some points might not be directly covered in the user's provided data. For example, specific battles like the Battle of Xiangyang are mentioned, so that could be a question about events.

Let me structure each question based on these points and ensure they're distinct and cover different areas. I'll make sure each has a clear, correct answer from the given context or facts.
