pergunta;resposta
The user has asked for 10 pairs of "pergunta;resposta" following certain instructions. I need to make sure each question is clear and relevant based on the data provided. Since I'm supposed to think in Portuguese, but generate an English response here, maybe I can start by creating questions about notable figures in Geology.
Finally, I'll format each pair as "pergunta;resposta" ensuring they are clear and concise.
