Okay, I need to generate 10 CSV pairs based on the provided context and facts. Let me start by understanding the context. The EU laws are a system of rules operating in member states, aiming to promote peace, values, and well-being. The EU has political, social, and economic institutions that transcend national states for cooperation and human development. The Court of Justice says the EU represents a new international legal order.

The facts include DBpedia data about the Law of the European Union, mentioning academic disciplines, scholars, and templates. The examples given are about the EU law, primary sources, secondary sources, legislative bodies, and the effect on member states' laws.

First, I need to create varied questions covering different aspects. The examples mention primary, secondary, and complementary sources. I should include questions about the purpose of EU law, its legal order, institutions, and sources. Also, the examples include the effect on member states' laws, so that's a good point.

Wait, the user specified 10 pairs. Let me check the examples again. The examples have questions about the definition of EU law, primary sources, secondary sources, legislative bodies, effect on member states' laws, and the three main sources. So I need to make sure the new questions are different but still based on the context.

Let me list possible questions:

1. What is the main objective of the EU according to the context?
2. Which institution is responsible for interpreting EU law?
3. What is the effect of EU law on member states' laws?
4. What are the three main sources of EU law?
5. What are the primary sources of EU law?
6. What are the secondary sources of EU law?
7. Which bodies form the legislative branch of the EU?
8. What is the significance of the EU's legal order?
9. What does the EU's legal system transcend?
10. What is the role of the Court of Justice in the EU?

Wait, the examples already have some of these. Let me check the examples again. The examples include questions about the definition of EU law, primary sources, secondary sources, legislative bodies, effect on member states, and three main sources. So I need to avoid repeating those but cover other aspects.

Looking at the context, it mentions the EU's institutions, the new international legal order, and the purpose of promoting peace and values. Also, the facts mention academic disciplines and scholars, but maybe that's not necessary for the questions. The user might want questions based on the context and facts, so I should focus on the EU's structure, sources, and objectives.

Let me think of other angles. Maybe the effect of EU law on member states, the role of the Court of Justice, the transcendence of institutions beyond national states, the legal order as a new international system, the purpose of the EU, the legislative bodies, the sources of law, the academic discipline, and the main objectives.

But I need to ensure each question is unique and covers different aspects. Let me try to structure them:

1. What is the main objective of the EU according to the context?
2. Which institution is responsible for interpreting EU law?
3. What is the effect of EU law on member states' laws?
4. What are the three main sources of EU, law?
5. What are the primary sources of EU law?
6. What are the secondary sources of EU law?
7. Which bodies form the legislative branch of the EU?
8. What is the significance of the EU's legal order?
9. What does the EU's legal system transcend?
10. What is the role of the Court of Justice in the EU?

Now, I need to make sure each question is distinct and the answers are based on the context. For example, the answer to the first question would be "promover a paz, seus valores e o bem-estar de seus povos." The Court of Justice is mentioned in the context as part of the institutions. The effect on member states is either direct or indirect. The three sources are primary, secondary, and complementary. The legislative bodies are the Parliament and the Council. The legal order is a new international order. The legal system transcends national states for cooperation. The role of the Court is to interpret and ensure compliance with EU law.

I need to check if these answers are correct based on the context. The context says the EU's institutions transcend national states for cooperation. The Court of Justice is part of the institutions. The effect on member states is direct or indirect. The three sources are primary, secondary, and complementary. The legislative bodies are the Parliament and Council. The legal order is a new international order. The main objective is promoting peace, values, and well-being.

I think that covers it. Now, I need to format them as CSV pairs, ensuring no repetition and that each answer is correct.
