Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the provided context and facts. The main points from the context are that British Satellite Broadcasting (BSB) was a UK-based TV company that started in 1986, launched in 1990, and was merged into BSkyB in 1990. The facts include various categories, models, ownerships, and other details about BSB.

First, I need to make sure each question is unique and covers different aspects. Let's start with the founding year, which is 1986. Then the launch date in 1990. The merger with Sky Television to form BSkyB is another key point. Ownership of channels like The Movie Channel, Galaxy, The Power Station, and Now. Also, the headquarters location, Marco Polo House. The film Hardware and Memphis Belle produced by BSB. The successor company Sky UK. Categories like British companies established in 1986, and the models they used like Template:Infobox company.

I need to avoid repetition. For example, not asking multiple questions about the merger. Let's check the facts again to ensure all points are covered. Also, the image representative, which is British Satellite Broadcasting logo.png. The type of entity, which is Company. The year it was disestablished, 1990. The parent company after merger, BSkyB. Channels owned by BSB. The location in London. The template models they used. The film productions. The categories they are part of. The successor company. The equivalent ID. The hypernym, which is Company. The location in England and United Kingdom. The original name, British Satellite Broadcasting plc.

Now, formulating questions: "Em que ano a British Satellite Broadcasting foi fundada?" (1986). "Qual a data de início da transmissão da British Satellite Broadcasting?" (25 de março de 1990). "Qual empresa resultou da fusão entre British Satellite Broadcasting e a Sky Television?" (BSkyB). "Quais canais de TV são de propriedade da British Satellite Broadcasting?" (The Movie Channel, Galaxy, The Power Station, Now). "Onde a British Satellite Broadcasting estava localizada?" (Londres). "Quais filmes foram produzidos pela British Satellite Broadcasting?" (Hardware e Memphis Belle). "Qual a imagem representativa da British Satellite Broadcasting?" (British Satellite Broadcasting logo.png). "Qual a categoria principal da British Satellite Broadcasting?" (British companies established in 1986). "Quem é o sucessor da British Satellite Broadcasting?" (Sky UK). "Quais modelos de página wiki são usados pela British Satellite Broadcasting?" (Template:Infobox company, Template:Short description, Template:Reflist, etc.).

Wait, need to ensure answers are directly from the facts. For example, the models used are listed in the facts, so the answer should be those specific templates. Also, the successor is Sky UK. The categories include multiple, but the main one is British companies established in 1986. The films are Hardware and Memphis Belle. The channels are The Movie Channel, Galaxy, The Power Station, Now. The location is London, Marco Polo House, England, UK. The equivalent ID is 129759966. The hypernym is Company. The parent company after merger is BSkyB. The disestablishment year is 1990. The original name is British Satellite Broadcasting plc. The image is British Satellite Broadcasting logo.png.

I need to make sure each question is unique and based on the facts provided. Avoid any assumptions not in the text. Check for repetition and ensure all 10 pairs are distinct and correct.
