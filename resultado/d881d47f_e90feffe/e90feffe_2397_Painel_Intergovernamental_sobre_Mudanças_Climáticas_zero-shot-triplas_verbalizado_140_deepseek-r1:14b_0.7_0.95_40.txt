Alright, so I need to generate 10 pairs of questions and answers based on the provided context about the IPCC. Let me read through the context carefully first.

The context mentions that the IPCC was created in 1988 under the UN by UNEP and WMO. It synthesizes knowledge on climate change, specifically global warming, its causes, effects, risks, and suggests solutions. It doesn't do original research but gathers existing studies. It's considered the top authority and won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2007.

Looking at the facts section, there are a lot of details about the organization's structure, leaders like Hoesung Lee, members such as Filippo Giorgi and Kevin E. Trenberth, its location in Geneva, Switzerland, the types of reports it produces, and its relation to other UN programs.

I need to create varied questions covering different aspects: history, purpose, structure, notable people, achievements, etc. Each question should have a single correct answer from the context.

Let me think of possible questions:

1. When was the IPCC created? (1988)
2. Which two organizations initiated the IPCC? (UNEP and WMO)
3. What's the main goal of the IPCC? (Synthesize knowledge on climate change, causes/effects/solutions)
4. What does the IPCC not do? (Original research)
5. How is the IPCC recognized? (Top authority; Nobel Peace Prize 2007)
6. Where is the IPCC based? (Geneva, Switzerland)
7. Who leads the IPCC? (Hoesung Lee as Chair)
8. Which UN program is the IPCC part of? (UN Environment Programme and World Meteorological Organization)
9. What are the IPCC's reports about? (Sources, impacts, mitigation strategies)
10. What does the IPCC not do? (Doesn't produce original research)

Wait, question 10 is a repeat in terms of content but phrased differently. Maybe I should adjust that to avoid repetition. Perhaps ask what the IPCC doesn't do instead.

Also, check for uniqueness: each question should be distinct and cover different aspects. I think these are all unique enough.
