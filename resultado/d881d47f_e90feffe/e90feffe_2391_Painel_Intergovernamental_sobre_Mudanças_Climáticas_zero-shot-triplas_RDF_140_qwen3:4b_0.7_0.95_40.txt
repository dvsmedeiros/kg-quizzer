Okay, I need to generate 10 pairs of questions and answers based on the provided context about the IPCC. Let me start by understanding the key points in the context.

The IPCC is a scientific-political organization created in 1988 by the UN, under the UN Environment Programme and the World Meteorological Organization. Its main goal is to synthesize and disseminate the latest knowledge on climate change, specifically global warming, its causes, effects, risks, and ways to combat them. It doesn't conduct original research but summarizes work by independent scientists. It's the most authoritative body on global warming, has been the basis for global and national climate policies, but faces criticism. It has produced five major reports and some other documents, with the first in 1990 and the last in 2014. The work of the IPCC, involving thousands of top scientists, earned it the Nobel Peace Prize in 2007.

Now, I need to create varied questions that cover different aspects. Let me think of different angles: what is the IPCC, when was it created, its purpose, its structure, its role, its Nobel Prize, its reports, its parent organizations, and its headquarters.

I need to make sure each question is unique and based on the facts provided. Let me list possible questions:

1. What is the full name of the organization known as IPCC?
2. When was the IPCC established?
3. Which organizations created the IPCC?
4. What is the main purpose of the IPCC?
5. What is the role of the IPCC in climate policies?
6. When was the first and last major report of the IPCC published?
7. Which Nobel Prize was awarded to the IPCC in 2007?
8. What are the parent organizations of the IPCC?
9. Where is the headquarters of the IPCC located?
10. What is the main function of the IPCC according to the text?

Now, I need to check if these are all based on the provided facts. The first question is covered by the context. The second is the year 1988. Third, the UN, PNUMA, and WMO. Fourth, the purpose is to synthesize and spread knowledge on climate change. Fifth, it's the basis for global and national policies. Sixth, first in 1990, last in 2014. Seventh, Nobel Peace Prize. Eighth, UN Environment Programme and WMO. Ninth, Geneva. Tenth, the main function is to synthesize and disseminate knowledge.

I need to make sure all answers are correct and directly from the text. Also, check for any possible overlaps or similar questions. Let me ensure each question is distinct and covers different aspects. Looks good. Now, format them as CSV with semicolons and no extra text.
