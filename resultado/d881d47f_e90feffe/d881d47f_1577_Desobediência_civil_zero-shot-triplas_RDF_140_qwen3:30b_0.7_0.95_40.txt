Okay, I need to generate 10 pairs of questions and answers in Portuguese based on the given context and facts. Let me start by understanding the context.

The context says that civil disobedience is a peaceful political protest against unjust laws or oppressive governments. It mentions Henry David Thoreau as the original concept creator, and examples like Gandhi and Martin Luther King. Also, it states that if a government doesn't meet the population's demands, the people have the right to disobey.

Now, the facts are a bunch of RDF triples linking various events and people to "Civil_disobedience". For example, many protests and movements are listed as using civil disobedience methods. There are also mentions of specific individuals like Thoreau, Gandhi, and others associated with civil disobedience.

I need to create questions that are varied and cover different aspects of the content. Let me brainstorm possible questions:

1. Who formulated the concept of civil disobedience? (Answer: Henry David Thoreau)
2. Which leader used civil disobedience in India's independence? (Answer: Mahatma Gandhi)
3. What is the purpose of civil disobedience according to the context? (Answer: To protest against unjust laws or oppressive governments)
4. Which movement in the US used civil disobedience for civil rights? (Answer: Martin Luther King's movement)
5. What right does the population have if the government doesn't meet their demands? (Answer: The right to disobey)
6. Name a historical event where civil disobedience was used. (Answer: 1998 Russian miners' strike)
7. Which country's protests are linked to civil disobedience in the facts? (Answer: Montenegro, Serbia, etc.)
8. Who is associated with the concept of civil disobedience in the facts? (Answer: Henry David Thoreau, Gandhi, Martin Luther King)
9. What is the main characteristic of civil disobedience? (Answer: Peaceful protest against unjust laws)
10. Which philosopher's idea is linked to civil disobedience? (Answer: Henry David Thoreau)

Wait, I need to make sure each question is unique and not repeating similar ones. Also, check if the answers are directly from the context or inferable. For example, the context says Gandhi applied it in India's independence, so that's a valid answer. The facts list many events, so using specific examples from there is okay.

Let me verify each question:

1. First question is about the originator, which is in the context.
2. Gandhi's role is mentioned in the context.
3. The purpose is stated in the context.
4. Martin Luther King's movement is mentioned.
5. The right to disobey is in the context.
6. The facts have specific events like the 1998 Russian miners' strike.
7. The facts list multiple countries, so a general answer about Montenegro or others is okay.
8. The context mentions Thoreau, Gandhi, King, and the facts have other individuals.
9. The context says it's peaceful and against injustice.
10. Thoreau is the philosopher mentioned.

I need to ensure that the answers are correct based on the given content. Also, format them as CSV with semicolons. Avoid any markdown and just the CSV.
