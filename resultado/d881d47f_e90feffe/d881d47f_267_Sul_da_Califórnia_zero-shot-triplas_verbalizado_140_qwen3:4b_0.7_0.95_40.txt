Okay, I need to generate 10 pairs of questions and answers in CSV format based on the provided context and facts. Let me start by understanding the context. The user provided information about Southern California, including its geographical boundaries, population in 2019, and various facts about places, organizations, and cultural aspects associated with it.

First, I should identify different aspects covered in the facts. The key points include geography (boundaries, area, counties), population, cultural aspects (languages, museums, music groups), organizations (companies, radio stations), and historical events or earthquakes. Also, there are mentions of specific images, templates used in Wikipedia, and other related entities.

Next, I need to make sure each question is unique and covers different aspects. For example, one question can be about the geographical boundaries, another about population, another about the types of entities, and so on. I need to avoid repetition and ensure each question is distinct.

Looking at the facts, there are mentions of Southern California's area (56505 mi²), population in 2019 (23.8 million), subdivisions like Kern County, San Diego County, and others. Also, there are references to languages (Tataviam), cultural groups (Chinese Americans, Guatemalan Americans), and organizations (May Company, Fedco).

I should also check for the types of entities mentioned, like "PhysicalEntity100001930", "Location", and "YagoPermanentlyLocatedEntity". Additionally, there are images associated with Southern California, such as I-8 (CA).svg, I-210 (CA).svg, and others.

I need to form questions that are directly based on these facts. For example, a question about the area, another about the population, another about the subdivisions, another about the types of entities, another about the languages spoken, and so on. Also, including questions about the geographical boundaries, the types of images, and the historical events or earthquakes that affect the region.

I should ensure that each answer is directly derived from the provided facts. For instance, the answer to a question about the population in 2019 is "aproximadamente de 23,8 milhões de pessoas." The answer for the area is "56505 mi²."

I need to make sure that the questions are in Portuguese and that the answers are accurate based on the given information. Also, the format must be CSV with each pair on a new line, separated by a semicolon. No extra text or explanations, just the CSV data.

Let me start drafting the questions and answers:

1. Qual é a área total de Southern California?
2. Qual é a população de Southern California em 2019?
3. Quais são alguns exemplos de subdivisões de Southern California?
4. Qual é o tipo de entidade que Southern California é?
5. Quais são alguns idiomas falados em Southern California?
6. Quais são alguns grupos étnicos que possuem população significativa em Southern California?
7. Quais são alguns exemplos de organizações ou empresas que atendem a Southern California?
8. Quais são alguns exemplos de imagens representativas de Southern California?
9. Quais são alguns eventos históricos ou sismos que afetaram Southern California?
10. Qual é o tipo de entidade que Southern California é, segundo o Yago?

Now, I need to check if these questions are based on the facts provided. For example, the area is mentioned as 56505 mi², the population in 2019 is 23.8 million. Subdivisions include Kern County, San Diego County, etc. The types of entities include PhysicalEntity100001930, Location, YagoPermanentlyLocatedEntity. Languages include Tataviam. Ethnic groups include Chinese Americans, Guatemalan Americans. Organizations include May Company, Fedco. Images include I-8 (CA).svg, etc. Historical events include the 1994 Northridge earthquake.

I should make sure each answer is directly from the facts. Also, check that the questions are not repeated and cover different aspects. For example, the question about subdivisions can be answered with Kern County, San Diego County, etc. The question about the Yago type is answered with YagoPermanentlyLocatedEntity.

I need to ensure that all answers are correct and based on the given information. Also, the format must be exactly as specified, with each pair on a new line, separated by a semicolon, and in Portuguese.
