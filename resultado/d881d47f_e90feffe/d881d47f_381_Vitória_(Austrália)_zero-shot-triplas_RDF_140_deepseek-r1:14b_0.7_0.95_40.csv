Looking at the data; it's structured in two main sections: one with a list of resources (each with their own properties) and another section describing Victoria as a populated place with some attributes like population density and depictions.
I need to generate questions that would naturally lead someone to look up these facts. Since the instructions mention avoiding technical jargon and making it simple for an elementary student; I'll keep the language straightforward.
Starting with population density: "What is Victoria's population density?" That seems like a good start; and the answer is directly given as 28 per km².
For depictions; the data includes several images on Wikimedia Commons. A question about symbols or imagery associated with Victoria can list those files.
Looking at people; many notable individuals are linked to Victoria. A question about famous Victorians would allow listing a few names from the data.
