Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs based on the provided information about the Scottish Parliament. Let me start by understanding the key points from the data given.

First, the Scottish Parliament was established in 1999 after a referendum in 1997. The Scotland Act 1998 granted it legislative powers. The Parliament has 129 members, and the last election was in May 2ity. The leader is Alison Johnstone, and the Presiding Officer is mentioned. The Parliament has committees and works with the Scottish Government. The location is the Scottish Parliament Building in Edinburgh. There's also information about the next election and the political groups involved.

Now, I need to form questions that are based on these points. The examples given include questions about the date of the last election, the act that gave powers, the areas of competence, and the UK Parliament's reserved powers. I should follow a similar structure but ensure the questions are unique and cover different aspects.

Let me think of possible questions:

1. When was the Scottish Parliament established? (Answer: 1999)
2. What is the name of the act that gave the Scottish Parliament its powers? (Answer: Scotland Act 1998)
3. How many members does the Scottish Parliament have? (Answer: 129)
4. When was the last election held? (Answer: May 2021)
5. Who is the current leader of the Scottish Parliament? (Answer: Alison Johnstone)
6. What is the meeting place of the Scottish Parliament? (Answer: Scottish Parliament Building in Edinburgh)
7. What is the role of the Presiding Officer? (Answer: Oversees the proceedings)
8. What is the political group that holds the majority? (Answer: Scottish National Party)
9. What are some of the committees that the Scottish Parliament has? (Answer: Europe and External Relations, Health and Sport, etc.)
10. What is the main function of the Scottish Parliament? (Answer: To legislate on matters devolved to Scotland)

Wait, but the user might not want to repeat the same information as the examples. Let me check the examples again. The examples included questions about the date of the last election, the act, areas of competence, reserved powers, etc. So maybe I need to avoid those and focus on other aspects.

Looking back at the data, there's also the next election date, the number of members, the location, the political groups, the committees, the leader, and the structure. Also, the role of the Scottish Government in relation to the Parliament.

Another possible question: What is the role of the Scottish Government in relation to the Scottish Parliament? (Answer: The Scottish Government is responsible to the Parliament.)

Or: What is the significance of the Scottish Parliament Building? (Answer: It is the headquarters of the Scottish Parliament.)

Alternatively: What is the main function of the Scottish Parliament? (Answer: To make laws on matters devolved to Scotland.)

I need to make sure each question is distinct and based on the provided data. Let me compile 10 unique questions and answers.
