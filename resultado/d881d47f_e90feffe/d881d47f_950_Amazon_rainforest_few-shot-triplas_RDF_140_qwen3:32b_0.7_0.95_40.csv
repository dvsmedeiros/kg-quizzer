pergunta;resposta
Looking back, the user's text says: "Quantas espécies de árvores podem ser encontradas na floresta amazônica?;16.000" – so in the examples, they included that answer. However, in the actual provided data (the triple), there's no mention of 16,000. But the user's examples have that. So perhaps the user included that as an example, but the real data might not have it. But since the user provided that example, maybe it's okay to use it. Hmm. But in the actual data provided (the triple), the answer is not present. Wait, looking at the provided triple, there's a lot of info, but I don't see the number of tree species. The user's example includes that, but the triple doesn't. So perhaps that's an example the user made up, but the actual answer is not in the data. However, the user's instruction says to use the given data. So maybe that example is incorrect, but the user included it. So I need to stick strictly to the information in the provided text and the examples.
Wait, the user's examples include "Quantas espécies de árvores podem ser encontradas na floresta amazônica?;16.000" but in the provided data (the triple), there's no mention of 16,000 species. So maybe that's an error. But since the user provided it, maybe they expect it to be used. However, the user's instruction says to generate based on the given data. So perhaps that example is incorrect, but the user included it. Therefore, in my case, I should only use data that's present in the triple.
