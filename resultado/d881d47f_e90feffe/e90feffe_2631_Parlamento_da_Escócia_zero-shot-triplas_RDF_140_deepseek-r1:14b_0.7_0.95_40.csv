Okay; so I'm trying to figure out how to answer these questions based on the information provided about the Scottish Parliament. Let me start by reading through the data carefully.
- There are several committees listed under ns1:committees; including some specific ones like the Committee on Harassment Complaints against Former Ministers.
Now; I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs based on this data. Each pair should have a question that can be answered directly from the information provided and then the answer itself.
3. Last election date: May 6; 2021.
7. The leader is Alison Johnstone (and others; but she's the main one).
A1: It's an Assembly; among other classes.
   **A:** May 6; 2021.
   **A:** The last election was held on May 6; 2021.
    **A:** The data does not specify the number of electoral regions; but it is unicameral with 129 members.
