Okay, I need to generate 10 pairs of questions and answers based on the provided context about Normans. Let me start by reading through the context carefully.

The context mentions various aspects of Normans, including their history, related groups, languages, religious affiliations, notable figures, and specific events like battles. It also has a list of facts in Portuguese, but I'll focus on the English part for clarity.

I should create diverse questions that cover different topics from the context to ensure each question is unique and relevant. Each question must have one correct answer based on the provided information. Let me go through the facts one by one and extract potential questions.

Looking at the list:
- Normans are a Germanic people.
- They descended from Viking queens.
- They played significant roles in politics, military, and culture in Europe.
- Specific battles like the Battle of Olivento and Siege of Mahdia involved Normans.
- Notable figures include Richard of Salerno and figures from Jersey and Lyones families.
- They used certain templates on Wikipedia pages.
- Specific locations like St. Bride's Church and Taunton Castle are mentioned.

Now, I'll formulate questions based on these points:

1. Origin of Normans: What ethnic group descend from Viking queens whose descendants formed the Normans?
2. Historical Impact: In which historical periods were Normans influential politically, militarily, and culturally in Europe?
3. Notable Figures: Which person is known for being a Norman and involved in battles like the Siege of Mahdia?
4. Religion: What religion did Normans follow?
5. Language Usage: How many languages does the Norman community speak?
6. Regional Influence: In which region was the Norman Church of St. Bride's established?
7. Specific Template: Which Wikipedia template is used for pages about the Normans' history?
8. Battle Details: Who were the combatants in the Siege of Mahdia in 1159â€“1160?
9. Relationship with Other Groups: What other group is closely related to Normans?
10. Cultural Contribution: Which castle, built by Normans, is associated with historical battles?

I need to ensure each question has a single correct answer and covers various aspects of the Norman history as provided.
