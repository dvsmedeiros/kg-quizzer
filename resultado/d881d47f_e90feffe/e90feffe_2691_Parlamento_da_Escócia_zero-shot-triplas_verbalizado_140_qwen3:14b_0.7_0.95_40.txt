Okay, let's start by understanding the user's request. They want me to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the provided context and facts. The questions must be varied and cover different aspects of the Scottish Parliament, with answers strictly derived from the given information.

First, I need to parse through the context and facts to identify key points. The context mentions the establishment of the Scottish Parliament in 1999, its location in Edinburgh, the number of members (129), the election system, and the 2016 election. The facts include details like the number of members, the current Presiding Officer, the First Minister, the location of the building, the types of committees, and various political parties and their seats.

I should ensure that each question is unique and covers different areas. For example, one question could be about the number of members, another about the location, another about the election system, and so on. I need to check the facts for specific data points, like the current Presiding Officer being Alison Johnstone, the First Minister being Nicola Sturgeon, and the next election date.

I also need to avoid repetition. For instance, if I ask about the number of members, I shouldn't ask another question about the same fact. Instead, I can focus on other aspects like the types of committees, the political parties involved, the date of the last election, and the structure of the Parliament.

I should also make sure that the answers are directly from the provided information. For example, the answer to the question about the number of members is 129, as stated in the facts. The location is the Scottish Parliament Building in Edinburgh. The last election was on 2021-05-06, and the next one is on 2025-05-07.

I need to structure each question and answer clearly, ensuring that each pair is separated by a semicolon and that the CSV format is maintained. I'll have to be careful with the formatting to avoid any commas that might interfere with the CSV structure. Also, I must use the correct names and titles as provided in the facts, such as "Presiding Officer of the Scottish Parliament" and "First Minister of Scotland."

Finally, I'll review the generated pairs to ensure they meet all the requirements: 10 unique questions, answers based solely on the context and facts, and proper CSV formatting without any additional text or explanations.
