Okay, the user wants me to generate 10 CSV question-answer pairs based on the context provided about the Normans. Let me start by understanding the context. The context is about the Normans, so I need to recall key facts about them.

First, I should identify different aspects of the Normans to ensure the questions are varied. Topics could include their origin, historical events, cultural impact, famous figures, military tactics, and their role in different regions.

Wait, the user mentioned the Normans in the context, but the provided context is just the word "Normandos" in Portuguese. That's a bit confusing. Maybe there's a missing context? But the user specified to generate based on the given content, which is just "Normandos". Hmm, that might be an issue. Without more details, creating accurate questions could be challenging. However, perhaps the user expects general knowledge about the Normans, assuming that "Normandos" refers to the Normans in history.

Assuming that, here are some key points: the Normans were a people from the northern part of France, their role in the Domesday Book, their conquest of England, the Battle of Hastings, their influence in medieval Europe, their use of the longbow, and their establishment of the Duchy of Normandy.

Now, I need to create 10 distinct questions. Let me brainstorm:

1. Origin: Where did the Normans originate?
2. Conquest: Which English king was defeated by William the Conqueror?
3. Domesday Book: What was the purpose of the Domesday Book?
4. Military Tactics: What weapon was the Normans known for using effectively?
5. Duchy: Which region did the Normans establish as a Duchy?
6. Battle: Which battle led to the Norman conquest of England?
7. Influence: How did the Normans influence the English language?
8. Leadership: Who was the leader of the Normans during the Battle of Hastings?
9. Cultural Impact: What was the result of the Norman Conquest on English society?
10. Legacy: What is the modern name for the region of Normandy?

Wait, some of these might need to be adjusted for accuracy. For example, the Domesday Book was commissioned by William the Conqueror, so the answer would be to assess land and resources. The Battle of Hastings was in 1066. The Normans introduced French vocabulary to English. The Duchy of Normandy was established after their conquest of the region.

I need to make sure each question is unique and covers different aspects. Also, the answers must be directly inferable from the context. Since the user didn't provide specific details, I have to rely on general historical knowledge. Let me structure the CSV with these points, ensuring each pair is correct and follows the rules.
