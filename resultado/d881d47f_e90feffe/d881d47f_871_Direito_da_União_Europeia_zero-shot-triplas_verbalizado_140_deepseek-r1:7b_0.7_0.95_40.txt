Okay, I need to create a quiz with 10 question pairs in CSV format based on the provided context and facts about EU law. The user wants each pair to have one question and one correct answer related to the given information.

First, I'll review the context and facts again to understand the key points: the EU has laws like Common Market Law, which are organized into areas such as Law of the European Union. Key figures include John Bell and Henry G. Schermers who specialize in this area. There's also mention of various legal journals and templates used.

Now, I'll brainstorm different aspects to cover with questions:

1. **Definition of EU Law**: Start with a straightforward question about what the EU's laws are called.
2. **Key Figures**: Include someone like John Bell and his expertise.
3. **Journals and References**: Mention the journals and their relation to EU law.
4. **Model Pages**: Note how templates are used in the wiki format.
5. **Historical Context**: Touch on its origin post-WWII.
6. **Specialization Areas**: Highlight Henry G. Schermers' work.
7. **Application Focus**: Discuss what areas it covers, like trade or environment.
8. **Journal References Again**: Ensure clarity on their contributions.
9. **Legal Structure**: Mention the legal system's nature as international.
10. **Promotion Goal**: Relate to the EU's main objective.

For each question, I'll pair it with a correct answer that directly references the provided facts without overlap or repetition. Each answer should be precise and clear based on the information given.

Finally, I'll structure them into CSV format as specified, ensuring there are no additional comments or explanations.
