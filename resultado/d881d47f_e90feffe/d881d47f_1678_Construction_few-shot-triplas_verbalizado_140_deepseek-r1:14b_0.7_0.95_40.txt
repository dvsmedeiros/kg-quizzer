Okay, I need to generate 10 pairs of questions and answers based on the given context about construction in engineering and architecture. The output should be in CSV format with each line containing a question and its correct answer separated by a semicolon.

First, I'll review the context provided. It explains that construction involves executing projects from start to finish, including foundation to finishing touches, following techniques and norms. In Brazil, "reforma" is used for expansions or restorations, while "construction" and "obra" are terms used as well. The facts section lists various companies and their relation to the construction industry.

Looking at the examples provided, questions cover definitions, processes, key aspects, and specific terms related to construction. I need to ensure that each question is unique and covers different angles of the content.

I should start by identifying key points from the context: types of construction (infrastructures like bridges), execution stages, terminology differences between Brazil and elsewhere, companies in the industry, and any specific data or models mentioned.

Now, I'll brainstorm possible questions. For example, asking about the process definition, examples of infrastructure projects, terms used in Brazil, key aspects to consider during construction, types of companies involved, etc.

I need to make sure each question has a single correct answer that's directly supported by the context. Also, avoid repeating similar questions.

Let me list potential questions:

1. What is the process of building an edifice or infrastructure?
2. In Brazil, what term is used for expansions or restorations?
3. Which industry do companies like COMSA EMTE and Impresa Pizzarotti belong to?
4. What are some examples of construction projects in infrastructure?
5. What does "obra" translate to in English in this context?
6. What percentage does the construction product contribute to GDP?
7. Who typically manages a construction project?
8. What must be considered during large-scale construction projects?
9. What term is used for smaller client-known projects?
10. Which company operates in infrastructure and has a specific hiperônimo?

Wait, I need to ensure that each question is unique and covers different aspects without repetition. Also, the answers should directly relate to the provided facts.

Now, checking the context again, it mentions that "obra" can be translated as "construction." Companies like COMSA EMTE and Impresa Pizzarotti are in the construction industry. Construction involves projects like bridges, tunnels, etc. The GDP percentage is given as 6-9%, though I need to confirm if that's accurate from the context.

The user provided facts with numbers: Construction has a dado of 839.1 and another number of 40.2, but it's unclear what these represent. However, in the examples, they mentioned "seis a nove por cento" (6-9%) for GDP contribution, which I can use.

For managing construction projects, context mentions arquitetos (architects) as those who might manage or supervise, though more details would be better, but based on the example given, an architect is mentioned.

Considering all this, I'll structure each question to target different aspects: definitions, terminology, industry players, project management, and economic impact.
