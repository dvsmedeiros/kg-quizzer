Okay, so I need to generate 10 question and answer pairs based on the provided context about the Black Death. Let me start by reading through the context carefully to understand the key points.

The context mentions that the Black Death was the most devastating pandemic in human history, killing between 75 to 200 million people in Eurasia. It peaked in Europe between 1347 and 1351. The cause is believed to be Yersinia pestis bacteria, which leads to different forms of plague, with bubonic being the most common.

It also notes that the Black Death originated in Central or Eastern Asia, spreading along the Silk Road and reaching Crimea by 1343. From there, it was transported by fleas living on rats on Genoese merchant ships, spreading throughout the Mediterranean and then Europe via Italy.

The death toll in Europe is estimated at 30-60% of the population. The global population dropped from 475 million to around 350-375 million in the 14th century. It took about 200 years for Europe's population to recover, with some areas like Florence only recovering by the 19th century. The plague recurred until the early 20th century.

Now, looking at the facts provided, there are additional details like images of fleas infected with Yersinia pestis and descriptions about how the disease spread through rat fleas on ships.

I need to create varied questions covering different aspects: origin, causes, impact, spread mechanisms, effects, duration, recovery time, recurrences, population impact, etc. Each question should have a clear, single correct answer based on the context.

Let me draft some possible questions:

1. What was the primary cause of the Black Death?
   - Yersinia pestis bacteria

2. How did the Black Death spread from Crimea to Europe?
   - Via Genoese merchant ships carrying rats with fleas

3. Which form of plague was most common during the Black Death?
   - Bubonic plague

4. What percentage of Europe's population did the Black Death kill?
   - 30% to 60%

5. How long did it take for Europe's population to recover from the Black Death?
   - About 200 years

6. Where is believed to be the origin of the Black Death?
   - Central or Eastern Asia

7. What was the impact on the global population due to the Black Death in the 14th century?
   - Reduced from 475 million to 350-375 million

8. Until when did the plague continue to recur after the Black Death?
   - Early 20th century

9. What role did fleas play in spreading the Black Death?
   - Fleas transmitted Yersinia pestis from rats to humans

10. What was the main route of spread for the Black Death across Asia before reaching Europe?
    - The Silk Road

I think these cover a good range of aspects without repeating similar questions. Each answer is directly supported by the provided context.
