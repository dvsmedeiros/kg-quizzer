Okay, I've been given a task to generate 10 objective questions and their correct answers based on the provided context about Huguenots. The user has shared both the context and some facts related to them, such as their history, locations, symbols, etc.

First, I need to understand what exactly is being asked here. The user wants me to act as a quiz generator in the form of CSV data. Each question should have one correct answer that's directly supported by the given content. Also, I must ensure that each pair is unique and covers different aspects of the context provided.

Looking at the context, it's quite detailed but mostly about historical facts related to Huguenots, their locations, symbols, etc. So, I'll need to extract information from these points to formulate the questions.

I should start by identifying key areas within the context where I can create questions:

1. **Time Period**: The Huguenots were during the late 16th century.
2. **Regions**: Areas like Alsace, Moselle, Montbéliard, and New York.
3. **Symbols/Religious Figures**: The cross, Huguenot obelisk, Henry IV's image, etc.
4. **Locations**: Places such as La Rochelle, France; Orange County, New York.
5. **Documents and References**: Templates like {{Respell}}, {{ISBN}}, {{Short description}} etc.

Now, I can start formulating questions based on these areas, making sure each one is unique and has only one correct answer that's explicitly stated in the context.

For example, asking about when Huguenots left France would relate to the time period. Another question could ask about their main locations after expulsion.

I also need to ensure that I don't repeat regions or similar questions. Each question should target a different aspect—some on history, some on symbols, others on geographical locations, and so forth.

Once all 10 pairs are created, I'll present them in the CSV format as specified, with each question separated by a semicolon.
