Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the given context and facts about Warsaw. Let me start by carefully reading through the provided content to identify key points and facts that can be turned into questions.

First, the context mentions that Warsaw is the capital and largest city of Poland, located by the Vistula River. It has a population of around 1.7 million as of 2012. It's the capital of Masovian Voivodeship and has various industries, universities, cultural institutions, and historical landmarks. The historical part includes the 13th-century origins, the move of the capital to Warsaw in 1569, the World War II destruction, and the reconstruction. Also, it's a UNESCO World Heritage Site, has the Sigismund's Column, and is known for the Pact of Warsaw and the Treaty of Warsaw.

Looking at the facts, there are many names of people who were born or died in Warsaw, places and institutions located there, and some statistical data like population, weather, etc. I need to make sure that the questions cover different aspects: historical, cultural, geographical, statistical, and maybe some specific places or events.

I should avoid repeating similar questions. For example, there are multiple mentions of people born or died in Warsaw, so I can create questions about that. Also, there are mentions of institutions, landmarks, and events. I need to ensure each question is unique and covers different aspects.

Let me start listing possible questions:

1. What is the capital and largest city of Poland?
   Answer: Warsaw

2. Which river is near Warsaw?
   Answer: Vistula

3. What is the population of Warsaw as of 2012?
   Answer: 1,716,855

4. What is the name of the UNESCO World Heritage Site in Warsaw?
   Answer: The Old Town of Warsaw

5. Which historical event led to Warsaw becoming the capital of Poland?
   Answer: The transfer of the court to Warsaw by King Sigismund III in 1569

6. What is the nickname of Warsaw?
   Answer: Phoenix City

7. Which university is located in Warsaw?
   Answer: University of Warsaw

8. What is the name of the famous column in Warsaw?
   Answer: Sigismund's Column

9. What is the name of the sports stadium in Warsaw?
   Answer: Stadion Dziesięciolecia

10. What is the weather data for Warsaw, such as the highest temperature recorded?
   Answer: 36.2°C in June

Wait, but the user wants 10 pairs, and I need to make sure the answers are directly from the given facts. Let me check the facts again to ensure accuracy. For example, the population is 1,716,855 in 2012. The UNESCO site is the Old Town. The Sigismund's Column is in Warsaw. The Stadion Dziesięciolecia is a stadium in Warsaw. The highest temperature is 36.2°C in June. Also, there's a mention of the "Phoenix City" due to reconstruction. The transfer of the court to Warsaw in 1569. The university in Warsaw is the University of Warsaw.

I think those are valid. Let me check if there are other aspects. The context also mentions the Warsaw Uprising, but the user's facts don't mention that, so maybe not. Also, the fact that it's the capital of Masovian Voivodeship. Maybe a question about that. Also, the location in relation to the Baltic Sea and Carpathians. But the user might not have specified that, so maybe stick to the given facts.

Wait, the user provided a list of facts, so maybe some of them can be used. For example, "Warsaw is the capital of Masovian Voivodeship" is a fact. So a question: What is the voivodeship of which Warsaw is the capital? Answer: Masovian Voivodeship.

Another fact: Warsaw is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, so that's covered in question 4. Also, the population data. Also, the stadium in 2014-15 Polish football is in Warsaw. But that's a specific fact, so maybe a question about that. But the user wants 10, so I need to make sure they're all different.

Alternatively, the fact that Warsaw is the home of the European Border Guard Agency (Frontex) and the main financial and cultural center. But the user might not want to include that if not in the facts. Wait, the context says "Warsaw is the seat of Frontex, the European border guard agency." So that's a fact. So a question: Which city is the seat of Frontex? Answer: Warsaw.

Also, the fact that Warsaw has a 32nd most livable city in 2012. So a question: In which year was Warsaw ranked 32nd as the most livable city? Answer: 2012.

Another fact: Warsaw has a lema "Semper invicta", which is "Always Invictus" in Latin. So a question: What is the motto of Warsaw? Answer: Semper invicta.

Another fact: Warsaw has a specific image, like the Barbakan image. So a question: What is the representative image of Warsaw? Answer: Barbakan w Warszawie.

But the user might not want too many specific images. Alternatively, the fact that Warsaw has a specific precipitation data. For example, the precipitation in March is 29 mm. So a question: What is the precipitation in March for Warsaw (in mm)? Answer: 29.

So, compiling these, I need to make sure 10 questions are covered, each with a unique aspect from the given facts. Let me check if all answers are present in the facts.

Yes, the answers are all there. Now, I need to structure them as per the instructions, ensuring they are in CSV format with the questions and answers separated by semicolons, and each pair on a new line.
