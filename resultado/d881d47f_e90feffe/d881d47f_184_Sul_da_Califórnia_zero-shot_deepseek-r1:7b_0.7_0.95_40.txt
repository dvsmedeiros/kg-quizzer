Okay, I need to create a quiz based on the provided context about "Sul Da California." The user has given me specific instructions, so let's break it down.

First, they want 10 question pairs in CSV format. Each pair should have one question and one correct answer related to the content. They emphasized that each question must be unique and cover different aspects of the context.

Looking at the context provided: it mentions Sul Da California is a coastal region in Northern California with its own language, culture, and landscapes like redwoods and beaches. It also highlights its significance as a cultural heritage site for indigenous tribes.

So, I should think about various topics related to this context: geography, culture, history, environment, etc. Each question should target one of these areas without repeating the same type.

Let me start brainstorming questions:

1. What is the primary language spoken in Sul Da California? That's straightforward from the context.
2. Name a major natural feature there. Redwoods are mentioned, so that works.
3. Which group has historical significance regarding Sul Da California? The indigenous tribes.
4. What's an important cultural practice associated with it? Feasting was significant for the tribe.
5. What type of environment is it? Biodiversity-rich coastal area.
6. Who were the original inhabitants before European contact? Native Americans.
7. What natural hazard could be present there? Earthquakes since it's along the coast.
8. What does the region resemble in shape? Similar to Oregon due to tectonic activity.
9. What is a popular activity people engage in there? Fish catching and shellfish hunting.
10. How has Sul Da California been recognized culturally? As a UNESCO World Heritage site.

These cover various aspects like demographics, environment, culture, history, and natural features. Each question is unique and directly related to the context provided. I should ensure each answer is explicitly stated in the content, so they are correct.

I also need to format it as CSV with each pair on separate lines, using semicolons as separators. No extra text or explanations—just the data.
