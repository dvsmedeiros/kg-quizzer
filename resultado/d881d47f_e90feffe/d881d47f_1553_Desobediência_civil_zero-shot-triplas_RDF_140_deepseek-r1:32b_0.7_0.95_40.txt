Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs based on the provided context and facts about civil disobedience. Let me start by understanding the content thoroughly.

The main points from the context are:
- Civil disobedience is a form of peaceful protest against unjust laws or oppressive governments.
- It was originally formulated by Henry David Thoreau.
- Successfully applied by Mahatma Gandhi in India/Pakistan and Martin Luther King Jr. in the U.S. for civil rights.

Looking at the facts, there's a list of various protests and movements that used civil disobedience as their method. These include events like the 1998 Russian miners' strike, the 2015 Montenegrin crisis, and others up to 2022. Also, several notable figures and organizations are linked to civil disobedience.

Now, I need to create varied questions that cover different aspects without repeating similar ones. Each question should have a clear, correct answer from the provided data.

Let me brainstorm possible questions:

1. Who first proposed civil disobedience?
   - Thoreau

2. What was the purpose of 'Code Rood'?
   - Civil Disobedience

3. Which movement used it in India?
   - Gandhi's independence movement

4. How did MLK use it?
   - For civil rights and against segregation

5. What's an example from 1998?
   - Russian miners' strike

6. A recent event in 2022?
   - Kazakh unrest

7. Who is known for this concept besides Thoreau?
   - Gandhi, MLK, Veliyankode Umar Khasi

8. Which organization uses it as a method?
   - Ruckus Society, Refuse Fascism, etc.

9. What was the purpose of 'Shooting of Sean Monterrosa'?
   - Civil Disobedience

10. Example from 2017 in Serbia?
    - Serbian protests

I should ensure each answer is directly supported by the facts and context provided. Also, vary the types of questions: some about figures, others about events or purposes.

Let me structure these into clear CSV format without any markdown, just plain text with semicolons.
