Okay, I need to generate 10 question and answer pairs based on the context provided about the Black Death. Let me first understand what information is available in the context.

The context mentions that the Black Death was one of the most devastating pandemics in human history, occurring between 1346 and 1353. It was caused by the bacteria Yersinia pestis and spread through fleas from infected rodents. The disease had three forms: bubonic, septicemic, and pneumonic. Symptoms included fever, chills, black boils, and swollen lymph nodes. It led to social changes like the decline of the feudal system and increased wages for laborers due to population reduction.

Now, I need to create varied questions covering different aspects. Let me think about possible angles: causes, time period, forms of the disease, symptoms, effects on society, and specific names related to the pandemic.

I should ensure each question is clear and has only one correct answer based on the context. Also, avoid repeating similar questions. 

Let me start drafting:

1. When did the Black Death take place? The answer would be 1346-1353.
2. What bacteria caused it? Yersinia pestis.
3. How was it transmitted? Fleas from rodents.
4. What were the main symptoms? Fever, chills, black boils, swollen lymph nodes.
5. What social change occurred after? Decline of feudalism and wage increases.

Wait, I need 10 questions. Let me think of more points:

6. How many forms did it have? Three: bubonic, septicemic, pneumonic.
7. What's another name for the Black Death? Bubonic plague or Great Plague.
8. Impact on population: Reduced by about a third in Europe.
9. Which group saw wage increases? Laborers and peasants.
10. How did it affect the workforce? Shortage leading to higher demand.

That should cover 10 questions without repetition, each related to different aspects of the context.
