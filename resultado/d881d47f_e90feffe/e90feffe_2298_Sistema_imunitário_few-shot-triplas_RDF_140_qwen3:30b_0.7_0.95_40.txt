Okay, I need to generate 10 pairs of questions and answers in Portuguese based on the provided context and facts. Let me start by thoroughly understanding the context and facts given.

The context explains the immune system, its functions, key scientists like Mechnikov, mechanisms like phagocytosis and the complement system, types of immunity (innate vs. adaptive), diseases related to the immune system (autoimmune, immunodeficiency), and mentions various cells and terms. The facts include a lot of RDF data with resources related to the immune system, like cell types, scientists, and medical conditions.

First, I need to make sure each question is unique and covers different aspects. Let me brainstorm possible questions:

1. Who coined the term "immune system"? The context mentions Ilya Ilyich Mechnikov in 1882.
2. What are the basic immune mechanisms in eukaryotes? The text lists phagocytosis, defensins, and the complement system.
3. What is the basis of vaccination? The context states that adaptive immunity is the basis, through memory.
4. What happens when the immune system is underactive? The answer is immunodeficiency.
5. What is the term for an overactive immune system attacking normal tissue? Autoimmunity.
6. Which cells are part of the immune system? The facts list many, like B cells, T cells, macrophages, etc.
7. What is the role of the adaptive immune system? It creates memory to respond better to pathogens.
8. What are the two main types of immunity? Innate and adaptive.
9. What causes immunodeficiency? The context mentions genetic diseases, HIV/AIDS, and immunosuppressants.
10. What are the basic immune mechanisms in vertebrates? The text mentions more complex mechanisms like adaptive responses.

Now, I need to ensure each question is distinct and the answers are directly from the context or facts. Let me check each one against the provided information to confirm accuracy. For example, the question about the scientist should be Mechnikov. The answer about immunodeficiency should include the causes mentioned. Also, the answer about the immune system's basic mechanisms should include phagocytosis, defensins, and complement. 

I need to avoid repetition. For instance, if I already asked about the two main types of immunity, I shouldn't ask similar questions. Also, ensure that each answer is a single correct response, not multiple. 

Let me draft the questions and answers now, making sure they are in Portuguese and follow the CSV format. Each line should be "pergunta;resposta" without any extra text. Let me count to ensure there are exactly 10 pairs.
