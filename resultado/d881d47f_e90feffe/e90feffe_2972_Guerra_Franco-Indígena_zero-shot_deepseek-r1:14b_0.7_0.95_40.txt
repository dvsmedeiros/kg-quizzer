Okay, I need to generate 10 multiple-choice questions based on the context provided about the Guerra Franco-Indígena. Let me start by understanding what this conflict was about.

The Guerra Franco-Indígena refers to a series of military actions taken by the French in their colonies against Native American tribes, particularly during the French and Indian War (1754–1763) in North America. The French were fighting against the British and various Native American allies. Key events include battles at Fort Duquesne, Fort William Henry, and the Siege of Quebec.

I should create varied questions that cover different aspects: causes, significant events, key figures, outcomes, and related conflicts. I'll make sure each question has a clear correct answer based on the provided context.

1. What is another name for the Guerra Franco-Indígena in North America?
   - French and Indian War

2. Which European power were the French primarily fighting against?
   - British

3. Who was a prominent Native American leader during this conflict?
   - Pontiac or Tecumseh (but I should confirm if they were involved)

Wait, Pontiac's Rebellion was after the French and Indian War, so maybe not. Perhaps someone else? Maybe mention the Algonquin or Huron tribes?

4. What strategic location did the French defend at Fort Duquesne?
   - Pittsburgh area

5. What happened to Fort William Henry in 1757?
   - It fell to the British after a siege.

6. Who led the French forces during the Siege of Quebec?
   - Montcalm, but he was defeated by Wolfe.

7. Which battle marked a turning point for the French?
   - Battle of Saratoga or Valley Forge? Wait, Valley Forge wasn't part of this war.

8. What was the main objective of the French military in North America?
   - Control over trade routes and territories

9. How did the conflict end for the French?
   - Treaty of Paris (1763), losing most colonies.

10. What broader context does this war fit into?
    - Part of the Seven Years' War
