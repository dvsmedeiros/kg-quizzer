Okay, I need to generate 10 objective questions and answers based on the provided context about the 1973 oil crisis. Let me start by reading through the context carefully to make sure I understand all the key points.

The context mentions that the crisis began in October 1973 when OPEC members imposed an oil embargo on countries supporting Israel during the Yom Kippur War. The embargo targeted Canada, Japan, the Netherlands, the UK, and the US, later expanding to Portugal, Rhodesia, and South Africa. The oil price rose from $3 to $12 per barrel, with even higher prices in the US. This caused a "first oil shock," followed by the 1979 crisis.

Now, I need to create 10 different questions that cover various aspects of this information. Let me list out possible topics: the start date, the embargo's target countries, the price increase, the name of the crisis, the OPEC group involved, the reason for the embargo, the expansion of the embargo, the economic impact, the subsequent crisis, and the effect on specific countries.

I should ensure each question is unique and based on the facts given. Let me check the examples provided to see the structure. The examples include questions about the start date, price, the second crisis, the term used, the embargo proclamation, the reason for separation from the US, Nixon's negotiations, Kissinger's date, when the embargo was lifted, and when the US left Bretton Woods. However, the user's context doesn't mention Bretton Woods, so I need to avoid that.

Wait, in the context, it's mentioned that the embargo was in March 1974, but the example has a question about when the embargo was lifted. The context says the embargo ended in March 1974, so that's correct. But I need to make sure not to include any information not in the context. Also, the example includes a question about the second oil shock, which is mentioned in the context as "seguido pela crise do petróleo de 1979, chamada o 'segundo choque do petróleo.'"

So, I need to create questions that don't repeat the same topics as the examples. Let's think of 10 different angles:

1. When did the 1973 oil crisis start?
2. Which countries were initially targeted by the embargo?
3. What was the price of oil in March 1974?
4. What was the name of the first oil shock?
5. Which organization imposed the embargo?
6. Why did the embargo happen?
7. Which countries joined the embargo later?
8. What was the economic impact of the embargo?
9. What was the name of the second oil shock?
10. What was the effect of the embargo on the US?

Wait, the example already has a question about the second oil shock. So I need to make sure my questions are different. Let me adjust. Maybe:

1. When did the 1973 oil crisis begin?
2. Which countries were initially targeted by the embargo?
3. What was the price of oil in March 1974?
4. What was the name of the first oil shock?
5. Which organization imposed the embargo?
6. Why was the embargo imposed?
7. Which countries joined the embargo later?
8. What was the economic impact of the embargo?
9. What was the name of the second oil shock?
10. What was the effect of the embargo on the US?

Yes, these are all different and based on the context. Now, I need to make sure the answers are correct according to the context provided. Let me check each one:

1. Start date: October 1973. Correct.
2. Initially targeted: Canada, Japan, Netherlands, UK, US. Correct.
3. Price in March 1974: $12. Correct.
4. First oil shock: "primeiro choque do petróleo". Correct.
5. Organization: OPAEP (Organização dos Países Árabes Exportadores de Petróleo). Correct.
6. Reason: Countries supporting Israel during the Yom Kippur War. Correct.
7. Later countries: Portugal, Rhodesia, South Africa. Correct.
8. Economic impact: Global crisis, "first oil shock". Correct.
9. Second oil shock: 1979. Correct.
10. Effect on US: Prices were even higher. Correct.

I need to ensure that the answers are exactly as per the context. Also, the examples have some answers with commas, but in the context, the answer for the second oil shock is "segundo choque do petróleo" without the year. Wait, the context says "seguido pela crise do petróleo de 1979, chamada o 'segundo choque do petróleo.'" So the answer is "segundo choque do petróleo". The example question about the second oil shock is answered as "1979", but in the context, the answer is "segundo choque do petróleo". Wait, that's conflicting. Wait, the example given in the user's instructions has a question: "Qual foi outro termo usado para a crise do petróleo?;primeiro choque do" and the answer is "primeiro choque do". But in the context, it's "chamada o 'segundo choque do petróleo'". So maybe the answer for the second oil shock is "segundo choque do petróleo", not the year. However, the example in the user's instruction has a question "Quando foi a segunda crise do petróleo?;1979," which is correct because the second oil shock was in 1979. So the answer is 1979. But in the context, it's called "segundo choque do petróleo". So the user's example seems to have two answers: the term and the year. However, the example's answer for the second oil shock is "1979", but the context says "seguido pela crise do petróleo de 1979, chamada o 'segundo choque do petróleo'." So the term is "segundo choque do petróleo", and the year is 1979. Therefore, the answer to "Qual foi outro termo usado para a crise do petróleo?" is "primeiro choque do", and for "Quando foi a segunda crise do petróleo?" is "1979".

So in my questions, I need to make sure that the answers are correct. For the second oil shock, the answer is "1979", as per the example. Therefore, the answer for the question "What was the name of the second oil shock?" would be "segundo choque do petróleo", but the example shows that the answer for "Quando foi a segunda crise do petróleo?" is "1979".

Therefore, when I create the questions, I need to match the context accurately. Let me confirm:

In the context:

- "seguido pela crise do petróleo de 1979, chamada o 'segundo choque do petróleo'."

So the second oil shock is called "segundo choque do petróleo", and it occurred in 1979.

Therefore, the answer to "What was the name of the second oil shock?" is "segundo choque do petróleo", and the answer to "When was the second oil crisis?" is "1979".

So in my questions, I need to make sure that the answers are correct. For example, if I ask "What was the name of the second oil shock?", the answer is "segundo choque do petróleo". If the question is "When was the second oil crisis?", the answer is "1979".

Therefore, I need to structure the questions accordingly. Let me proceed to create the 10 questions now, ensuring that each is unique and based on the context.
