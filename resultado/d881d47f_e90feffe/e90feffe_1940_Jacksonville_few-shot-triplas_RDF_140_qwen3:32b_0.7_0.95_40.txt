Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs based on the provided data. Let me start by reviewing the information given. The main subject is Jacksonville, Florida. The data includes various facts like population, county, historical events, and more. The examples given cover questions about population, year of consolidation, river, etc. 

First, I'll list out all the key points from the data. The city is in Duval County, had a population of 1.345 million in 2010, consolidated in 1968, the St. Johns River flows by, the distance to Miami isn't provided, the French colony was Fort Caroline, the Timucua people were there before, named after Andrew Jackson. Also, there are some other details like area land, record temperatures, etc.

Now, considering the examples, the user wants similar questions but not repeating the exact ones. Let me check the examples again. They asked about the largest city in Florida, population in 2010, ranking, county, consolidation year, river, distance to Miami, French colony name, Timucua people, and the person after whom the city was named.

So, I need to come up with 10 new questions. Let's see. From the data, there's also the area land value: 1935498000.0. Maybe that's in square feet? Not sure, but it's a number. The record high temperatures in January and December, and October averages. The official name is "City of Jacksonville and Duval County". The subject category is cities in Florida. Also, there are templates used, but that's probably not relevant. The distance to Miami wasn't given, so maybe that's a trick question, but the user's example left it blank. Maybe the user expects an answer even if it's not in the data? Wait, in the examples, the distance question's answer is empty. So maybe I should avoid that unless the data provides it. Let me check the provided data again. The user's example for distance to Miami is blank, so perhaps the data doesn't include that. Therefore, I shouldn't include it unless it's in the data. 

Looking at the data again, the properties for Jacksonville include areaLand, which is 1935498000.0. The unit isn't specified, but maybe that's in square feet? If so, converting that to square miles could be a question. Wait, the user might want to know the area. But the example didn't ask about that, so maybe it's okay. 

Another point is the population rank "1", but in the example, the answer was 12th. Wait, the user's example says "Com base apenas na população, qual é o ranking de Jacksonville nos Estados Unidos?;12ª". But in the data, the property is "populationRank" with value "1". That seems contradictory. Wait, maybe "populationRank" refers to within Florida? Because the example answer was 12th in the US. So the data's "populationRank" is "1" might be first in Florida. So perhaps a question about being the largest city in Florida. But the example already asked that. So maybe another question about the population rank in the US. But the data doesn't have that, so maybe the example is using an external source. Hmm. Maybe the user made a mistake in the example. But since the example is given, I need to follow the data provided. 

So, the data says "populationRank" is "1". But the example answer says Jacksonville is 12th in the US. That's conflicting. Maybe the "populationRank" in the data is the rank within Florida. So, a possible question could be "Jacksonville é a cidade mais populosa da Flórida?", which the example already has. So perhaps another question about the population rank in the US isn't possible since the data doesn't provide it. 

Looking at the data again, the user's example for the distance to Miami is empty. So perhaps the data doesn't include that, so the answer is not present. 

Other possible questions: What is the name of the county where Jacksonville is located? Answer: Duval. That's covered in the example. 

What is the official name of the city? The data says "City of Jacksonville and Duval County". So a question could be "Qual o nome oficial da cidade de Jacksonville?;Cidade de Jacksonville e Condado de Duval". 

What is the area of Jacksonville in square feet? The data has "areaLand" as 1935498000.0. So a question like "Qual a área de Jacksonville em pés quadrados?;1.935.498.000". But maybe the user wants it in square miles. The data doesn't specify, so perhaps better to use the given value. 

What is the highest temperature recorded in January? The data has "janRecordHighF" as "85". So a question could be "Qual a temperatura mais alta registrada em janeiro em Jacksonville?;85°F". 

What is the lowest temperature recorded in February? The data has "febRecordLowF" as "10". So question: "Qual a temperatura mais baixa registrada em fevereiro em Jacksonville?;10°F". 

What is the average high temperature in October? The data has "octAvgRecordHighF" as "89.1". So question: "Qual a média das temperaturas máximas em outubro em Jacksonville?;89,1°F". 

What is the name of the river that flows through Jacksonville? The example already asked that, but maybe a different phrasing. 

What is the name of the museum mentioned? The data includes "Karpeles Manuscript Library Museum (Jacksonville)" and others. So a question could be "Qual o nome de um museu localizado em Jacksonville?;Museu Karpeles Manuscript Library". 

What is the name of the convention center in Jacksonville? The data has "Prime F. Osborn III Convention Center". So a question: "Qual o nome do centro de convenções de Jacksonville?;Prime F. Osborn III Convention Center". 

What is the name of the college in Jacksonville? The data mentions "Jones College (Jacksonville)" and others. So a question: "Qual o nome de uma faculdade localizada em Jacksonville?;Jones College". 

I need to make sure not to repeat the example questions. The examples covered population, rank, county, consolidation year, river, distance to Miami, French colony, Timucua people, and naming after Andrew Jackson. So I need to avoid those topics unless there's another angle. 

Now, compiling the possible questions:

1. Qual o nome oficial da cidade de Jacksonville?;Cidade de Jacksonville e Condado de Duval
2. Qual a área de Jacksonville em pés quadrados?;1.935.498.000
3. Qual a temperatura mais alta registrada em janeiro em Jacksonville?;85°F
4. Qual a temperatura mais baixa registrada em fevereiro em Jacksonville?;10°F
5. Qual a média das temperaturas máximas em outubro em Jacksonville?;89,1°F
6. Qual o nome de um museu localizado em Jacksonville?;Museu Karpeles Manuscript Library
7. Qual o nome do centro de convenções de Jacksonville?;Prime F. Osborn III Convention Center
8. Qual o nome de uma faculdade localizada em Jacksonville?;Jones College
9. Qual o nome do rio que corta Jacksonville?;Rio St. Johns
10. Em que ano ocorreu a consolidação de Jacksonville com o Condado de Duval?;1968 (but that's already in the example, so maybe another question)

Wait, the consolidation year is already in the example. So maybe another question. Let me check the data again. The user's example includes "Em que ano a consolidação fez com que Jacksonville se tornasse parte do Condado de Duval?;1968." So that's a duplicate. Need to avoid that. 

Another possible question: What is the name of the historical preserve in Jacksonville? The data has "Timucuan Ecological and Historic Preserve". So a question: "Qual o nome de uma área de preservação histórica em Jacksonville?;Timucuan Ecological and Historic Preserve". 

Another one: What is the name of the foundation in Jacksonville? The data has "Tom Coughlin Jay Fund Foundation". So question: "Qual o nome de uma fundação localizada em Jacksonville?;Tom Coughlin Jay Fund Foundation". 

Another: What is the name of the university in Jacksonville? The data has "Logos University". So question: "Qual o nome de uma universidade localizada em Jacksonville?;Logos University". 

I need to pick 10, making sure they are unique and not in the examples. Let's finalize the list.
