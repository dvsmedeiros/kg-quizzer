Okay, I need to generate 10 question and answer pairs in Portuguese based on the provided context about oxygen. Let me start by reading through the context carefully to understand all the key points.

First, the context mentions oxygen's atomic number 8, symbol O, and atomic mass 16. It's part of the chalcogens group, a non-metal, and a strong oxidizing agent. It forms compounds easily, especially oxides. Its electronegativity is second only to fluorine. It's the third most abundant element in the universe, mainly in the Earth's crust as oxides. In normal conditions, it's O2, making up 20.8% of the atmosphere. It's essential for life, but there's a decline in atmospheric levels due to fossil fuels. It's colorless, odorless, and used in respiration, organic molecules, and various industrial applications. The discovery by Scheele and Priestley, Lavoisier's role, the name origin from Greek, and its applications like in steel production, rockets, and medical uses are also covered.

Now, I need to make sure each question is varied and covers different aspects. Let me list possible topics:

1. Atomic structure and properties (atomic number, symbol, mass)
2. Group and classification (chalcogens, non-metal)
3. Electronegativity
4. Abundance in the universe and Earth's crust
5. Molecular form (O2) and atmospheric composition
6. Role in life and respiration
7. Historical discovery (Scheele, Priestley, Lavoisier)
8. Name origin
9. Industrial applications
10. Environmental impact (decline in atmospheric levels)

I need to avoid repetition. Let me draft each question and answer:

1. What is the atomic number of oxygen? Answer: 8.
2. What group does oxygen belong to? Answer: Calcogénios (chalcogens).
3. What is the second most electronegative element? Answer: Fluorine.
4. What is the third most abundant element in the universe? Answer: Oxigénio (oxygen).
5. What is the molecular form of oxygen under normal conditions? Answer: O2.
6. What percentage of the atmosphere is oxygen? Answer: 20,8%.
7. Who discovered oxygen? Answer: Carl Wilhelm Scheele and Joseph Priestley.
8. What is the origin of the name "oxigénio"? Answer: From Greek "oxys" (acid) and "gonos" (producer).
9. What are industrial uses of oxygen? Answer: Steel production, welding, rocket propellant.
10. What is causing the decline in atmospheric oxygen? Answer: Emissões from fossil fuel burning.

Now check if each answer is directly from the context. For example, the name origin is mentioned in the context. The decline is due to fossil fuels. The molecular form is O2. The percentage is 20.8%. The abundance in the universe is third. The group is chalcogens. Electronegativity second to fluorine. Discovery by Scheele and Priestley. Industrial uses include steel, welding, rockets. The answer about the name is correct. The historical part mentions Lavoisier's role, but the question is about discovery, so Scheele and Priestley are correct.

I think these cover different aspects without repetition. Now format them as CSV with semicolons.
