Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to generate 10 CSV pairs of questions and answers based on the provided context and facts. First, I need to understand the context thoroughly. The main topic is imperialism, its definition, historical examples, and related terms. The facts provided are in RDF format, which might include various entities linked to imperialism, like political parties, books, genocides, etc.

The user specified that the questions should be varied and cover different aspects of the content. Each question must have a single correct answer derived from the context. I need to avoid repeating similar questions and ensure the answers are explicitly or inferably from the given data.

Looking at the examples provided, the questions are about definitions, historical context, types of imperialism, and related terms. For instance, "A palavra imperialismo tem suas origens em qual língua antiga?" translates to "The word imperialism originates from which ancient language?" with the answer "latina" (Latin). Another example is about the types of imperialism, like formal vs. informal.

Now, I need to extract information from the context and facts. The context mentions that "Império" comes from Latin "imperium" meaning power or authority. The facts include various resources linked to imperialism, such as books, political parties, genocides, and more. For example, the RDF data shows that "Imperialism" is a subject in several non-fiction works, and there are entries related to genocides like the Herero and Namaqua genocide with motive linked to imperialism.

I should form questions that test knowledge of these points. For example, the origin of the term, types of imperialism (formal, informal), examples of imperialist actions (like the Portuguese Angola era), and related concepts (such as the role of the metropolis and peripheries). Also, there are mentions of political parties and ideologies linked to imperialism, like the Canadian Party and Conservative Party of Canada.

I need to ensure that each question is distinct and covers different facets. Let me list possible questions:

1. Origin of the term "imperialismo".
2. Definition of an empire as per the context.
3. Type of imperialism associated with colonial domination.
4. Example of a genocide linked to imperialism.
5. Category related to the history of colonialism.
6. Subject of the book "Culture and Imperialism".
7. Political party linked to imperialism ideology.
8. Term for the central part of an empire.
9. Type of imperialism involving indirect control.
10. Example of a non-fiction subject related to imperialism.

Now, checking if these are all covered in the context and facts. The first question is covered by the origin in Latin. The second is the definition given. Third, the Portuguese Angola era is an example of formal imperialism. Fourth, the Herero and Namaqua genocide's motive is imperialism. Fifth, the category of history of colonialism is mentioned. Sixth, the book "Culture and Imperialism" has imperialism as a non-fiction subject. Seventh, the Canadian Party is linked. Eighth, the metropolis is the central part. Ninth, informal imperialism is indirect. Tenth, the book's subject is imperialism.

I need to ensure the answers are accurate. For example, the answer to the first question is Latin. The second answer would be the definition provided. Third, formal imperialism. Fourth, Herero and Namaqua genocide. Fifth, history of colonialism. Sixth, imperialism. Seventh, Canadian Party. Eighth, metropolis. Ninth, informal. Tenth, non-fiction subject.

Wait, the user's examples have some answers in quotes, like "formal" in quotes. I should follow that format. Also, check for any possible mistakes. For instance, the Portuguese Angola era is under the subject "Category:History of colonialism", so the fifth question's answer would be "history of colonialism".

I need to make sure each answer is directly from the context or facts provided. Let me verify each point again. Once confirmed, structure the CSV pairs accordingly, ensuring proper formatting and avoiding any markdown.
