Okay, so I need to create 10 multiple-choice questions based on the context provided about Vitória in Australia. The user has given me a CSV format to follow, and they want exactly 10 pairs of questions and answers. Each question should be unique and cover different aspects of the content.

First, I'll look at the information given about Vitória. It's located in Tasmania, is an island, part of Australia, a state, capital city Hobart, population around 5 million, known for beaches, mountains, forests, wildlife like koalas and kangaroos, agriculture, sheep farming, wine production, and tourism.

I should make sure each question targets different aspects: maybe one about location, another about the island status, capital, population, natural features, wildlife, economy, etc. I'll need to vary the questions so they don't repeat similar topics.

Let me brainstorm possible questions:

1. Where is Vitória located? (Tasmania)
2. Is Vitória an island? Yes
3. What's the capital? Hobart
4. Population around 5 million
5. Known for beaches, mountains, forests
6. Wildlife includes koalas and kangaroos
7. Economy: agriculture, sheep farming, wine
8. Famous for something like wine or tourism?
9. Part of Australia as a state
10. Nickname related to gardens? I think it's the Garden State.

Wait, in the original response, some questions are repeated or similar. Like question 3 and 7 both mention capital. Also, question 5 is about population which isn't directly stated but inferred. Hmm, maybe I can adjust that.

I need to ensure each question is unique and covers different points without overlap. Let me reorganize:

1. Where is Vitória? Tasmania
2. Is it an island? Yes
3. Capital city: Hobart
4. Population: ~5 million
5. Natural features: beaches, mountains, forests
6. Wildlife: koalas, kangaroos
7. Agriculture and sheep farming are part of the economy
8. Known for wine production
9. Part of Australia as a state
10. Nickname: Garden State

That looks better. Now I can format them into CSV with each line being "pergunta;resposta".

I should double-check that each answer is correct based on the context provided. For example, confirming that Vitória's nickname is indeed the Garden State.

Wait, in the initial response, question 10 was about tourism and natural beauty, but I think the correct nickname is Garden State. So perhaps I should adjust that to make it accurate.

Also, ensure that each answer is exactly as given or clearly inferred. For example, the population is stated as around 5 million, so that's direct.

I think this setup covers all required aspects without repetition and meets the user's specifications.
