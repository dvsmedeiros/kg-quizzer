Okay, so I need to generate 10 question and answer pairs based on the provided data about the Scottish Parliament. Let me look through the information given.

First, I'll scan the RDF data for key facts. The Scottish Parliament was established in 1999 after a 1997 referendum. There's mention of the Scotland Act 1998 as the enabling legislation. The competencies are specified in that act, allowing them to make laws except in reserved areas handled by Westminster.

Looking at the examples provided, they cover establishment year, enabling act, legislative competence, reserved powers, and historical context like absence of a parliament for centuries and events leading up to its creation.

I should ask questions about these points. Maybe start with when it was established, then what law created it, areas where they can make laws, reserved matters, etc. Also, include some history like the 1973 Kilbrandon Report suggesting an assembly.

Wait, in the examples, there's a mention of the lack of a Scottish Parliament for centuries and why initial suggestions before WWI were shelved. I should cover that too.

Let me structure this:

1. When was the Scottish Parliament established?
2. What act created its legislative powers?
3. What areas can they legislate on?
4. Which matters are reserved to UK Parliament?
5. How many years without a parliament before 1999?
6. Why were pre-WWI suggestions put aside?
7. When did nationalism surge?
8. What does the Scotland Act 1998 outline?
9. What was recommended by the Kilbrandon Report?
10. Until when could the UK Parliament legislate on Scottish matters?

That should cover all key points from the data and examples.
