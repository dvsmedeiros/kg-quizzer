Okay, so I need to create 10 multiple-choice question pairs based on the given context about the Franco-Indian War. Let me start by understanding the key points of this conflict.

First, I should figure out what caused the war. From the context, it seems that the French were supporting the Indians against the British. So a question could be about identifying who the French supported during the war.

Next, who was involved on the other side? The British and the American colonists, as they were also fighting for independence around that time.

Then, thinking about the outcome, it's important to note who won. The American colonists and their allies, including the French, ended up winning significant battles like Saratoga and Yorktown, which led to the British withdrawal.

The treaty ending the war was the Treaty of Paris in 1783. That would make a good question about the name of the treaty.

Battle locations are another point. The major battles were in places like Saratoga, New Jersey, and Yorktown, Virginia. So I can include those as possible answers for a question about key battle locations.

Key figures involved could be George Washington leading the American forces, Lafayette supporting them from France, and Cornwallis leading the British. Using these names can create questions about their roles.

The impact of the war is significant because it led to the independence of the United States. So a question about its broader consequences would be relevant.

Economic changes might include the loss of the British East India Company's trade, which affected their economy. So a question on economic effects could be included.

Lastly, the causes of Indian support from France can be explored through a question about why they were allied with the French.

I need to make sure each question is unique and covers different aspects: causes, participants, outcomes, treaties, key events, figures, impacts, economic effects, and motivations. That should provide a comprehensive set of questions.
