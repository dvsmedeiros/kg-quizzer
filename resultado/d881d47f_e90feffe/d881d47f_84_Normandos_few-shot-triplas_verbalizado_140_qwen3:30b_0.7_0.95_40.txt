Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants 10 pairs of questions and answers in CSV format based on the provided context and facts. The main challenge is to ensure that each question is unique and covers different aspects of the content without repetition.

First, I need to go through the context and facts carefully. The context mentions that Normans were a Germanic people in northern France, descendants of Vikings, and their historical roles in various regions. The facts include details about their religion, languages, architectural styles, historical events, and related terms.

I should start by identifying key points from the context. For example, the origin of the Normans, their religious beliefs, languages they spoke, significant historical events, architectural styles, and related terms. Then, I need to form questions around these points.

Let me list possible questions:

1. What is the origin of the Normans? (From the context: Germanic people, Viking descent)
2. What religion did the Normans follow? (Norse paganism and Christianity)
3. What languages did the Normans speak? (Old Norse, Old Norman, Latin)
4. What architectural style is associated with the Normans? (Norman architecture)
5. What historical event involved the Normans in England? (Norman Conquest)
6. What is the meaning of the word "Norman"? (Northmen/Norsemen)
7. Which famous battle involved the Normans? (Battle of Hastings)
8. What are some places associated with Norman architecture? (St Mary's Church, Tower of London)
9. What are the origins of the term "Viking"? (Vikingr from Old Norse)
10. What historical events did the Normans participate in? (Crusades, Sicily, etc.)

Now, I need to check the facts to ensure the answers are accurate. For example, the facts mention "Normans segue a religião Norse paganism" and "Normans segue a religião Christianity," so the answer should include both. Also, languages like Old Norse, Old Norman, and Latin are mentioned.

I need to make sure each question is distinct and not overlapping. For instance, one question about religion, another about language, another about architecture, etc. Avoid questions that are too similar.

Also, check for any specific names or events mentioned in the facts, like "Battle of Hastings," "Norman Conquest," "St Mary's Church," etc. These can be used as specific examples.

Finally, format the answers correctly in CSV, ensuring each pair is separated by a semicolon and no extra text is added. Double-check that there are exactly 10 pairs and that they are all based on the provided data.
