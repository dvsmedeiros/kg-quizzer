Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to approach this problem where I need to generate 10 pairs of questions and answers in CSV format based on the given context about oxygen. The instructions are pretty specific, so I need to make sure I follow them closely.

First, I'll read through the context provided. It's a detailed paragraph about oxygen, covering its chemical properties, discovery, role in the atmosphere, and applications. There's also some RDF data that links various resources related to oxygen, but I think the main content is the descriptive text.

The task is to create 10 questions, each paired with the correct answer, using only the information provided. The output should be a CSV file with each line containing "pergunta;resposta". Each question must be unique and cover different aspects of the content.

I need to make sure that each question is clear and directly related to the context. Also, the answers should be explicit or inferable from what's written. I shouldn't add any extra information or explanations—just the questions and answers in the specified format.

Let me start by identifying key points in the context:

1. Oxygen is element 8 with symbol O.
2. It's a non-metal, part of the chalcogens group.
3. Mass number is 16 u.
4. Second highest electronegativity after fluorine.
5. Abundance: third most abundant in the universe, most in Earth's crust as part of oxides.
6. At standard conditions, it's O2 gas, making up 20.8% of air.
7. Essential for life, used in respiration and many organic molecules.
8. Produced by photosynthesis; started accumulating ~2.5 billion years ago.
9. Discovery by Scheele (1773) and Priestley (1774), with Priestley published first.
10. Name comes from Greek words meaning "acid" and "producer."
11. Applications include medical use, industrial processes, rocket propellant.

Now, I'll brainstorm possible questions based on these points:

- What is oxygen's atomic number?
- Which group does oxygen belong to in the periodic table?
- Who discovered oxygen and when?
- What percentage of Earth's atmosphere is oxygen?
- How is oxygen produced naturally?
- What is the chemical symbol for oxygen?
- Why is oxygen crucial for life?
- What are some uses of oxygen?

I should make sure each question is distinct and covers different aspects. Let me structure them:

1. Atomic number
2. Group in periodic table
3. Discoverers and their discovery years
4. Percentage in atmosphere
5. Natural production process
6. Chemical symbol
7. Importance in biological processes
8. Source of oxygen's name
9. Uses in industry or healthcare
10. Physical state at room temperature

Wait, the last one is about O2 gas, so that could be another question.

Now, I'll write each as a question and find the corresponding answer from the context:

1. What is the atomic number of oxygen? → 8
2. To which group does oxygen belong in the periodic table? → Chalcogens (or VIA)
3. Who discovered oxygen and when was it first identified? → Scheele in 1773, Priestley in 1774
4. What percentage of Earth's atmosphere is oxygen? → Approximately 20.8%
5. How is oxygen produced naturally on Earth? → Through photosynthesis by plants and algae
6. What is the chemical symbol for oxygen? → O
7. Why is oxygen essential for most life forms on Earth? → It's needed for cellular respiration to produce energy
8. What does the name "oxygen" mean in Greek? → Acid (oxy) and producer (genes)
9. What are some uses of oxygen? → Medical, industrial processes like steelmaking, rocket propellant
10. What is the physical state of oxygen at room temperature? → Diatomic gas

I need to make sure each answer is accurate according to the context. For example, the discovery dates and names: Scheele discovered it in 1773 but Priestley published first in 1774.

I think these cover a good range of topics without overlapping too much. Each question addresses a different aspect of oxygen's properties, history, and applications.

Here is the CSV file containing 10 pairs of questions and answers based on the provided context about oxygen:

```
What is the atomic number of oxygen?;8
To which group does oxygen belong in the periodic table?;Chalcogens (or VIA)
Who discovered oxygen and when was it first identified?;Scheele in 1773, Priestley in 1774
What percentage of Earth's atmosphere is oxygen?;Approximately 20.8%
How is oxygen produced naturally on Earth?;Through photosynthesis by plants and algae
What is the chemical symbol for oxygen?;O
Why is oxygen essential for most life forms on Earth?;It's needed for cellular respiration to produce energy
What does the name "oxygen" mean in Greek?;Acid (oxy) and producer (genes)
What are some uses of oxygen?;Medical, industrial processes like steelmaking, rocket propellant
What is the physical state of oxygen at room temperature?;Diatomic gas
```

Each line represents a unique question paired with its corresponding answer, covering various aspects of oxygen's properties, history, and applications.
