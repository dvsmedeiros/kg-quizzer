Okay, let's see what the user is asking for here. They want me to act as a question generator and create exactly 10 pairs of questions and answers. Each pair should be in CSV format with specific details: one relevant question, one correct answer, separated by a semicolon, and all in Portuguese. No extra stuff like explanations or comments.

First, I need to understand the context provided. It mentions "Construction" but doesn't give much detail. Since it's about construction, maybe I can focus on different aspects of building structures or materials.

I should brainstorm 10 different questions related to construction that cover various topics within the field. Each question must be clear and directly relate to the content to ensure there's a single correct answer for each one. For example, I could ask about types of material used in buildings, chemical processes involved in construction, or historical methods like bricklaying.

Now, organizing this into a CSV format means creating a file with two columns: "pergunta" and "resposta." Each row will have one question and its corresponding answer. I need to make sure there are exactly 10 rows without any extra information or commentary.

I also need to be careful not to repeat questions, so each should address a unique aspect of construction. Ensuring that the answers are explicit or inferred from the context is important for compliance with the user's instructions.

Finally, after drafting all ten pairs, I'll format them into the required CSV structure and present it as the response.
