Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs based on the given data. Let me start by understanding the provided information.

The user has a dataset about "Force" (in Portuguese, "força") from DBpedia. There are several entries with properties like `ns2:otherunits`, `ns2:wikiPageUsesTemplate`, `dcterms:subject`, and `foaf:depiction`. Also, there are some examples of questions and answers. The task is to create 10 more pairs following the same pattern.

First, I should look at the existing examples to see the structure. The questions are about historical concepts, people, theories, and specific physics terms. The answers are concise, often names or specific terms.

Looking at the DBpedia data, the subject is "Force" with categories like "Category:Force", "Category:Natural_philosophy", "Category:Temporal_rates". The other units include "Kip (unit)" and "Poundal". The templates used are related to citations, categories, and units of force. There's also a depiction link to a torque animation.

Possible questions could be about the historical context, units of force, related concepts, or notable figures. Let me brainstorm some ideas:

1. What is the SI unit of force? (Answer: Newton)
2. Which ancient philosopher discussed force in the context of motion? (Answer: Aristotle)
3. What is the unit "Poundal" used for? (Answer: Force)
4. Who formulated the three laws of motion? (Answer: Isaac Newton)
5. What is the force that opposes motion between surfaces? (Answer: Friction)
6. Which force is responsible for holding atomic nuclei together? (Answer: Strong nuclear force)
7. What is the term for the sum of all forces acting on an object? (Answer: Net force)
8. Which scientist contributed to the understanding of gravitational force? (Answer: Isaac Newton)
9. What is the unit "Kip" commonly used in? (Answer: Engineering)
10. What is the force exerted by a fluid on an object? (Answer: Buoyant force)

Wait, I need to check if these answers are present in the data. The existing examples mention Newton, Einstein, and the Standard Model. The DBpedia entry mentions "força" and has categories related to natural philosophy. The units are Kip and Poundal. The templates include "Units_of_force". 

So, maybe some questions could be:

- What is the SI unit of force? (Answer: Newton)
- Which ancient philosopher believed in the concept of "impetus"? (Answer: Aristotle)
- What is the unit "Poundal" related to? (Answer: Force)
- Who developed the laws of motion? (Answer: Isaac Newton)
- What is the force that resists the relative motion of two surfaces? (Answer: Friction)
- Which force is responsible for the attraction between masses? (Answer: Gravitational force)
- What is the term for the total force acting on an object? (Answer: Net force)
- What is the unit "Kip" used for? (Answer: Force in engineering)
- Which force is mediated by gluons? (Answer: Strong nuclear force)
- What is the force that acts perpendicular to a surface? (Answer: Normal force)

I need to ensure that the answers are accurate and match the data. For example, the SI unit is Newton, which is mentioned in the examples. The ancient philosopher could be Aristotle, as he discussed motion. The units Kip and Poundal are listed. The strong nuclear force is part of the fundamental interactions. The net force is a term used in physics. The normal force is a common term. 

I should also check for any other possible terms from the DBpedia data. The categories include "Category:Force" and "Category:Natural_philosophy", so maybe questions about historical context. Also, the templates like "Units_of_force" could lead to questions about units.

Another angle: the example mentions "Modelo Padrão" (Standard Model) for subatomic forces. So a question could be about the Standard Model's particles. But the user's examples already have that. Maybe other forces like electromagnetic, weak, etc.

But the user wants 10 pairs. Let me finalize the list, ensuring they are distinct and based on the data provided.
