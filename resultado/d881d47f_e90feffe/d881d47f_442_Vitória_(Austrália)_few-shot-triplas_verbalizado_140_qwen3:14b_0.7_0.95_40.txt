Okay, let me tackle this. The user wants 10 pairs of questions and answers in CSV format based on the provided context and facts. First, I need to make sure I understand the context thoroughly. Victoria is a state in southeastern Australia, the smallest by area but second most populous. Melbourne is the capital, and there's a lot of historical and economic information. Then there are the facts, which include various people, places, events, and institutions associated with Victoria.

The key is to create varied questions that cover different aspects of the context and facts. I need to avoid repetition and ensure each question has a single correct answer from the text. Let's start by listing possible topics: history, geography, economy, politics, culture, notable people, institutions, events, etc.

For the first question, maybe something about the capital city, which is Melbourne. Then the population density. The economy's diversification. The separation from New South Wales in 1851. The gold rush's impact. The state's position in terms of GDP. The number of parliamentary seats. The current premier. The number of municipalities. The Melbourne Cricket Ground's significance.

Wait, the examples given by the user have questions like the economy type, GDP ranking, population density, capital's nickname, largest stadium, etc. I should check the facts for more specifics. For instance, the facts mention people like Daniel Andrews, places like the State Library of Victoria, events like the 1948 Australian Grand Prix, and institutions like the University of Melbourne.

I need to ensure that each question is unique and covers different points. Let's check the facts again for more data points. For example, the number of parliamentary seats (38 in the House of Representatives, 12 in the Senate). The current premier is Daniel Andrews. The state is divided into 79 municipalities. The Melbourne Cricket Ground is the largest stadium in Australia. The population density is 28 per km². The gold rush in the 1850s and 1860s. The separation from New South Wales in 1851. The official establishment in 1851. The first European settlement in 1803. The capital being Melbourne. The state's GDP ranking second in Australia but sixth in per capita. The number of universities, which is eight, with the University of Melbourne being the oldest, founded in 1853.

Also, from the facts, there are specific events and institutions, like the 1948 Australian Grand Prix, the State Library of Victoria, the Great Victorian Bike Ride, and the Melbourne Cricket Ground hosting the Olympics and Commonwealth Games. The population density is given as 28 per km². The current governor is Linda Dessau. The political structure with 38 and 12 seats. The University of Melbourne's founding date.

Now, I need to form questions around these points. Let's draft them:

1. What is the capital of Victoria, Australia? Answer: Melbourne.
2. What is the population density of Victoria (in people per square kilometer)? Answer: 28.
3. Which event was hosted by the Melbourne Cricket Ground in 1956? Answer: The Olympic Games.
4. What is the name of the current Premier of Victoria? Answer: Daniel Andrews.
5. When was the University of Melbourne established? Answer: 1853.
6. How many seats does Victoria have in the Australian House of Representatives? Answer: 38.
7. What is the name of the current Governor of Victoria? Answer: Linda Dessau.
8. Which stadium is the largest in Australia? Answer: Melbourne Cricket Ground.
9. What is the rank of Victoria in terms of GDP among Australian states? Answer: Second.
10. How many universities are there in Victoria? Answer: Eight.

I need to check if these are all covered in the context and facts. The 1956 Olympics were hosted by Melbourne, which is mentioned in the context as the capital being called the "sporting capital." The University of Melbourne was founded in 1853, as per the context. The population density is 28, as given. The current Premier is Daniel Andrews, and the Governor is Linda Dessau. The number of seats in the House of Representatives is 38, and the Senate has 12. The GDP rank is second. The number of universities is eight. The Melbourne Cricket Ground is the largest stadium.

Yes, these all seem to be supported by the text. Now, I need to format them as per the examples, using semicolons and ensuring correct answers. Also, check for any possible repetition or inaccuracies. For example, the 1956 Olympics is a key point. The context mentions that Melbourne is called the capital of sport, so the question about the MCG hosting the Olympics is valid. The answer should be accurate. The GDP ranking is second, which is correct. The population density is 28. All these points are covered.
