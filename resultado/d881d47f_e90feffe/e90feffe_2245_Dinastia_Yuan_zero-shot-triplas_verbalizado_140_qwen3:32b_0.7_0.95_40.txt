Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs based on the provided context and facts about the Yuan Dynasty. Let me start by carefully reading through all the information given. 

First, the context mentions that the Yuan Dynasty was founded by Kublai Khan in 1271. So, I can create a question about who founded it and when. That's straightforward.

Looking at the facts, there are several key points. The dynasty was established in 1271 and disestablished in 1368. That's a good starting point for a question about its duration. Also, the capital cities are mentioned as Shangdu and Khanbaliq. I can ask about the capitals, maybe which one is the main capital.

The dynasty is part of the Mongol Empire, so a question about its relation to the Mongol Empire might be relevant. There are also mentions of related events like the Battle of Xiangyang and the Red Turban Rebellion. Those could be topics for questions.

The facts list several people associated with the Yuan Dynasty, such as Kublai Khan, Gegeen Khan, and others. I can ask about which emperors belonged to the dynasty. The currency used was a banknote, so a question about their currency is possible.

The dynasty is categorized under several categories like History of China, Medieval Asia, etc. Maybe a question about the categories it's associated with. Also, the dynasty is linked to certain rebellions and battles, so asking about those could work.

I need to ensure each question is unique and covers different aspects. Let me list possible questions:

1. Who founded the Yuan Dynasty and in which year?
2. In which year was the Yuan Dynasty disestablished?
3. What were the capital cities of the Yuan Dynasty?
4. Which emperor was the founder of the Yuan Dynasty?
5. What is the main category under which the Yuan Dynasty is classified?
6. Which rebellion is directly related to the fall of the Yuan Dynasty?
7. What was the official currency used during the Yuan Dynasty?
8. Which dynasty succeeded the Yuan Dynasty in China?
9. What significant event marked the beginning of the Yuan Dynasty?
10. Which battle is associated with the Yuan Dynasty in the context of the Mongol conquest?

Now, I need to check if these questions are answerable from the provided facts. For example, the answer to question 5 might be the main category, but the facts mention multiple categories. The main one might be "History of China" or another. The answer should be the most relevant one. Also, for the battle in question 10, the Battle of Xiangyang is mentioned as related.

I should also verify if the answers are explicitly stated or can be inferred. For example, the capital cities are listed as Shangdu and Khanbaliq. The official currency was a banknote, as mentioned in the facts. The succeeding dynasty is the Ming Dynasty, as per the data.

I need to make sure each answer is correct and directly from the given information. Let me cross-check each question with the facts provided. Once done, I'll format them into the required CSV structure with semicolons separating the question and answer.
