Okay, I need to create a CSV file with 10 question-answer pairs based on the context provided about Jacksonville. Let's start by listing what I know about Jacksonville.

First, Jacksonville is the capital of Florida. That seems like a good starting point for a question. So, the first question could be about its location in Florida, and the answer would confirm that it's indeed the capital.

Next, Florida is known as the Sunshine State because of its warm climate. I can ask why it's called that and have the answer explain the climate aspect.

Moving on to history, Jacksonville has a rich colonial history. A question about the historical background with the answer highlighting colonial influences makes sense.

Economically, Jacksonville is a major port city. So, a question about its economic role as a port hub works well.

The St. Johns River runs through Jacksonville and is centrally located. That's another good fact to include.

Geographically, Jacksonville is in Northeast Florida. A question about its location within the state would be appropriate.

Culturally, Jacksonville has a unique blend of various ethnic groups. I can ask about its cultural diversity with an answer explaining the mix of traditions.

Politically, Duval County is where Jacksonville is located, and it's known for having strong mayors. That's another fact to use in a question.

The city was originally called something else, like Tebeltunica by the Timucua people. A question about its former name would be interesting.

Lastly, Jacksonville has many museums and cultural attractions, making it a center for arts and sciences. I can ask about its significance as a cultural hub with the corresponding answer.

I should make sure each question is distinct and covers different aspects: geography, history, economy, culture, politics, etc. Also, ensure that each answer is accurate based on the context provided.
