Okay, I need to generate 10 pairs of questions and answers based on the context and facts provided. Let me start by understanding what's given.

First, the context talks about civil disobedience and its various uses. The facts list out different instances where civil disobedience was used. Now, I should create similar scenarios for each fact.

Let's take the first fact: "Civil disobedience usa modelo de página wiki Template:Other uses." So, a question could be asking what are the other uses of civil disobedience besides fighting injustice? The answer would be listed in that wiki model.

Next, "Civil disobedience usa modelo de página wiki Template:Revolution sidebar." A relevant question might be about the revolution side of civil disobedience. Since it's linked to the Revolution page, I can ask about the significance or effects.

Continuing this way for each fact, ensuring each question is unique and covers different aspects. For example, "Em 2019–2020 clerical protests in Poland utiliza os métodos Civil disobedience." A possible question could be about the history of these commands in Poland.

Also, I need to make sure that the responses are clear and directly tied to each fact without adding extra information. Each response should stand alone as an answer to its respective question.

I'll structure it so each row starts with a question followed by the corresponding answer from the facts provided, separated by semicolons. This way, it's organized and easy to read.

Let me go through all the facts one by one to create 10 distinct questions, ensuring they cover various contexts and uses of civil disobedience. Once I have them all, I'll format them into a CSV structure as specified.
