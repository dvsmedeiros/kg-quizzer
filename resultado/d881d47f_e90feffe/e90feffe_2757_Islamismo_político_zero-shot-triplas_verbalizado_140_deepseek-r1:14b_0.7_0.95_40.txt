Okay, so I need to generate 10 pairs of questions and answers based on the given context about political Islamism. The user provided a detailed context and facts section, which includes various groups and their ideologies. Let me start by understanding what's required.

First, I should read through the context carefully. It explains that Islamism is a politico-religious ideology where supporters aim to implement their interpretation of Islam in society or state contexts. They emphasize Sharia law, pan-Islamic unity, creation of Islamic states, and rejection of non-Muslim influences, especially Western ones.

Looking at the facts section, there's a list of various groups and entities associated with Islamism. Each entry seems to follow a pattern like "[Group] possui ideologia Islamism" or similar phrases in Portuguese. There are also mentions of images, models used on Wikipedia pages, and other related data.

The user wants exactly 10 pairs of questions and answers in CSV format, each separated by a semicolon. The questions should be varied and cover different aspects of the content. Each question must have one correct answer based on the provided context. No additional explanations or comments are allowed—just the CSV data.

I need to ensure that I don't repeat similar questions and that each is unique. Also, since the user mentioned not adding any extra content beyond what's necessary, I should focus solely on extracting the required information from the given facts.

Let me brainstorm possible question types:

1. **Definition-based**: What is Islamism? Or its main goals?
2. **Examples of Groups**: Which groups are associated with Islamism?
3. **Ideological Emphasis**: What does Islamism emphasize, like Sharia or rejection of non-Muslim influences.
4. **Models and Wiki Pages**: Which Wikipedia templates are used for Islamism pages?
5. **Images Representing Islamism**: What images are mentioned?

Looking at the facts, I can extract specific groups, their ideologies, associated models, images, etc.

For example:

- Groups: Al Wefaq, 19th Division (Syrian rebel group), Movement for Democracy in Algeria, etc.
- Models: Template:Main list, Template:Commons category multi
- Images: 2012 Sydney Islamic protests.jpg, Mohammad Hadi Milani (1791).jpg

Now, I can structure questions around these.

Let me try to draft some:

1. **What is the primary goal of Islamism?** → Implementação da xaria (Sharia law).
2. **Which group is associated with pan-islamic unity?** → Al-Islamiyyun or any specific group from the list.
3. **Name a group that rejects non-Muslim influences as per Islamism.** → Any from the list, like 19th Division.
4. **What does Islamism emphasize besides Sharia?** → Unidade política pan-islâmica.
5. **Which Wikipedia template is used for Islamism pages?** → Template:Main list or others mentioned.
6. **Name an image representing Islamism from the facts.**
7. **What type of entity is Islamism classified as?** → Cognition100023271, YagoPermanentlyLocatedEntity, etc.
8. **Which party in Egypt has Islamism as its ideology?** → Muslim Brotherhood or others listed.
9. **Name a group that follows Islamism in Bangladesh.**
10. **What is the main political aspect of Islamism according to the context?**

Wait, I need to ensure each question is clear and the answer is directly extractable from the facts.

Let me make sure each Q&A pair is unique and covers different aspects without repetition.

I think I have a good list now. I'll structure them accordingly.
