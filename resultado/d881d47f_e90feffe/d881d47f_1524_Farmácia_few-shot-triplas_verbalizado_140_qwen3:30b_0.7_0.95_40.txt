Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs in Portuguese based on the given context and facts. Let me start by understanding the context and facts provided.

The context defines pharmacy as a science practiced by pharmacists, studying drugs, medications, and user interactions. The facts list various entities related to pharmacy, like organizations, companies, models, images, etc.

First, I should identify different aspects from the context and facts. The questions need to be varied, covering different elements like the origin of the word, related organizations, models used, images, industries, etc.

Looking at the examples provided, they ask about the origin of the word "farmácia," products sold in pharmacies, the Greek root, usage of terms, and roles of pharmacists. So I need to create similar questions but based on the given facts.

Let me go through the facts again. There are mentions of Australian Pharmaceutical Formulary, Pharmacy's Wikipedia template, images like "42-aspetti di vita quotidiana, medicine, Taccuino Sanitatis.jpg," companies like Apollo Hospitals, Wegmans, etc., and various models like Template:Pharmacy, Template:Wiki, etc.

Possible questions could be about the origin of the word "farmácia," the Wikipedia template used, images associated with pharmacy, industries related to pharmacy, organizations in the field, etc.

I need to ensure each question is unique and covers different aspects. Let me list possible questions:

1. De onde vem a palavra "farmácia"? (Based on the context's mention of Greek origin)
2. Qual modelo de página wiki é usado por Pharmacy? (Facts mention Template:Pharmacy, Template:Div col, etc.)
3. Quais são exemplos de imagens representativas de Pharmacy? (Facts list several images)
4. Quais empresas atuam na indústria Pharmacy? (Facts list many companies)
5. Quais são as disciplinas associadas a Pharmacy? (Facts mention "disciplina Pharmacy")
6. Qual é o tipo de Pharmacy? (Facts say "Pharmacy é do tipo Thing" and "Work")
7. Quais são os assuntos relacionados a Pharmacy? (Facts mention Category:Medicinal chemistry, etc.)
8. Quais organizações atuam na área de Pharmacy? (Facts list several organizations)
9. Quais são os setores de atividade de Pharmacy? (Facts mention Health care, Chemical sciences, Health sciences)
10. Quais são exemplos de produtos vendidos em Pharmacy? (Facts mention products in various companies)

Now, I need to check if each question is based on the context or facts, and that the answers are explicit or inferable. For example, the first question's answer is from the context's mention of Greek origin. The second question's answer is the template names from the facts. The third question's answer would be the image names listed. And so on.

I need to make sure not to repeat similar questions. For instance, if I ask about industries, I shouldn't ask about companies in the same category. Also, ensure that each answer is correct based on the facts provided.

Let me draft the 10 pairs now, ensuring they are varied and correct.
