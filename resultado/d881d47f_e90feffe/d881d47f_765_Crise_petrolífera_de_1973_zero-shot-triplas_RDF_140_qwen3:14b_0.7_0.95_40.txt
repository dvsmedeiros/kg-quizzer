Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the provided context about the 1973 oil crisis. First, I need to make sure I understand the context thoroughly.

The context mentions the start of the crisis in October 1973, the OPEC embargo targeting countries supporting Israel, the specific countries affected, the price increase from $3 to $12 per barrel, the term "first oil shock," and the subsequent 1979 crisis. The facts provided are in RDF format, but the user emphasized using the context, not the facts, so I can ignore the RDF part.

Now, I need to create 10 varied questions. Let's brainstorm possible angles. The main elements are the cause (embargo by OPEC), the target countries, the price change, the duration (until March 1974), the term "first oil shock," the consequences (economic and political effects), the subsequent 1979 crisis, the role of the Yom Kippur War, and the impact on the US.

I need to ensure each question is unique and covers different aspects. For example, one question could ask about the cause, another about the target countries, another about the price increase, and so on. I must avoid repetition and ensure answers are directly from the context.

Let me start listing possible questions:

1. What event triggered the 1973 oil crisis?
   - The OPEC embargo due to support for Israel in the Yom Kippur War.

2. Which countries were initially targeted by the embargo?
   - Canada, Japan, Netherlands, UK, USA.

3. What was the price increase of oil during the embargo?
   - From $3 to $12 per barrel.

4. When did the embargo end?
   - March 1974.

5. What is the term used for the 1973 oil crisis?
   - First oil shock.

6. What was the impact of the crisis on the US?
   - Prices were even higher than the global average.

7. Which war is linked to the embargo?
   - Yom Kippur War.

8. What was the effect on global politics and economy?
   - Caused a crisis with short and long-term effects.

9. What was the subsequent event after the 1973 crisis?
   - 1979 oil crisis (second oil shock).

10. Which countries were added to the embargo later?
    - Portugal, Rhodesia, South Africa.

Now, I need to check if all answers are correctly derived from the context. The initial countries are listed, the price change is mentioned, the duration, the terms used, the impact on the US, the linked war, the subsequent crisis, and the additional countries. That seems to cover all aspects without repetition.

I should format these into the CSV structure as specified, ensuring proper punctuation and no markdown. Each line should have a question and answer separated by a semicolon. Let me verify each pair again for accuracy and adherence to the user's instructions.
