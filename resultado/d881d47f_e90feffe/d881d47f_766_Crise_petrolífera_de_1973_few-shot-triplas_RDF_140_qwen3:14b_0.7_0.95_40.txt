Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the provided context and facts. Let me start by carefully reading the context given. The user mentioned the 1973 oil crisis, the embargo by OPEC, the targeted countries, the price increase from $3 to $12, and the aftermath. The facts also mention the embargo starting in October 1973, the countries involved, and the subsequent effects.

First, I'll list out the key points from the context: the start date (October 1973), the organizations involved (OPAEP/OPEC), the countries affected (Canada, Japan, etc.), the price increase, the duration (until March 1974), the term "first oil shock," and the second shock in 1979. The facts also mention the embargo's end in March 1974, the price jump, and the subsequent economic impacts.

Now, I need to create varied questions that cover different aspects. Let me think of possible questions:

1. When did the 1973 oil crisis begin? (Answer: October 1973)
2. Which organization imposed the oil embargo? (OPEC/OPAEP)
3. Which countries were initially targeted by the embargo? (Canada, Japan, etc.)
4. What was the price of oil before the embargo? (US$3 per barrel)
5. What was the price in March 1974? (US$12)
6. What was the term used for this crisis? (First oil shock)
7. When was the embargo lifted? (March 1974)
8. What was the impact on the US price? (Even higher than global)
9. Which event followed the 1973 crisis? (Second oil shock in 1979)
10. What was the reason for the embargo? (Support for Israel in Yom Kippur War)

I need to make sure each question is unique and covers different aspects. Also, check that answers are directly from the context. For example, the second question should be about the organization, not the countries. The answer for the embargo's end is March 1974. The reason for the embargo is the support for Israel during the war. The second shock is in 1979. The US price was higher than global, which is a detail from the context.

I should avoid repeating similar questions, like asking about the same countries multiple times. Also, ensure that each answer is accurate and directly from the text. For instance, the price went from $3 to $12, so the answer should reflect that. The term "first oil shock" is mentioned, so that's another point. The embargo was directed at countries supporting Israel, so that's the reason.

Now, let me structure these into the CSV format with semicolons. Each line should have a question and answer separated by a semicolon. I need to make sure there are exactly 10 pairs and no markdown is used. Also, check for any possible repetition and that all answers are correctly derived from the context.
