Okay, I need to generate 10 pairs of questions and answers based on the provided context about civil disobedience. Let me start by understanding the context thoroughly.

The context explains that civil disobedience is a peaceful form of political protest against unjust laws or oppressive governments. It mentions Henry David Thoreau as the original thinker and examples like Gandhi, Martin Luther King, and various historical events. The facts list numerous instances where civil disobedience was used, including specific events like the 1998 Russian miners' strike and the 2021 End SARS memorial protest.

Now, I need to create questions that cover different aspects of this topic. The questions should be varied and not repeat similar ones. Let me think of different angles: origins, key figures, methods, historical examples, and the purpose of civil disobedience.

First, I can ask about the origin of the concept. The answer would be Henry David Thoreau. Next, the key purpose, which is opposing unjust laws. Then, mention of Mahatma Gandhi and Martin Luther King as examples of its application. Also, the definition itself. Then, examples of events where it was used. Maybe the purpose of the movement, the methods employed, and the outcome when a government fails to meet population demands.

Wait, the user mentioned that the answer must be explicitly or inferable from the context. Let me check the facts again. The context says that civil disobedience is a peaceful protest against unjust laws or oppressive governments. The facts list various events, so I can use those as examples.

I need to ensure that each question is unique and covers different aspects. Let me list possible questions:

1. Who is the originator of the concept of civil disobedience?
2. What is the main purpose of civil disobedience?
3. Which historical figures are known for using civil disobedience?
4. What is the definition of civil disobedience according to the context?
5. Which events are examples of civil disobedience?
6. What is the method used in the 1998 Russian miners' strike?
7. What is the purpose of the civil disobedience movement in the context?
8. What is the outcome if a government does not satisfy the population's demands?
9. What is the primary goal of the civil disobedience movement?
10. Which historical event is mentioned as an example of civil disobedience?

Wait, but the user provided a list of events, so maybe I can use some of those. Let me check the facts again. The facts list events like 1998 Russian miners' strike, 2015 Montenegrin crisis, 2017 Albanian opposition protest, etc. So using those as examples.

But the user's instruction says that the questions should be based on the context and facts provided. The context includes the definition and the examples given in the facts. So the questions can be about the definition, key figures, examples, methods, purpose, etc.

Let me make sure each question is distinct. For example:

1. Originator of the concept.
2. Main purpose.
3. Key figures (Gandhi, MLK).
4. Definition.
5. Examples of events.
6. Method used in a specific event (like 1998 Russian miners' strike).
7. Purpose of the movement.
8. Outcome when government fails.
9. Primary goal.
10. Another example of an event.

I need to ensure that the answers are correct and directly from the context. Also, avoid repetition. Let me check if the events listed in the facts are mentioned in the context. The context says that civil disobedience was used by Gandhi, MLK, and others. The facts list events like 1998 Russian miners' strike, 2015 Montenegrin crisis, etc., so those can be examples.

Now, I need to structure the CSV with 10 pairs, each with a question and answer, in portuguese, using semicolons as separators. Let me make sure that each answer is correct and based on the given context. Also, avoid any markdown and just the CSV.
