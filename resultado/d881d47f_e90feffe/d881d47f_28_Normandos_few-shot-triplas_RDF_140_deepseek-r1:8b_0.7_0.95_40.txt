Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the given context and facts about the Normans. Let me start by understanding the key points from the provided information.

The Normands were a Germanic people from northern France. Their aristocracy often came from Viking origins. They played significant roles politically, militarily, and culturally during the medieval period, including in parts of Europe and the Mediterranean. They are associated with events like the Norman Conquest of England, their colonization of Normandy, and their involvement in the Crusades.

Looking at the facts, there's information about battles they participated in, places they occupied, their origin from Scandinavia, notable figures like Richard of Salerno, their architectural influences, and their religious practices. 

I should create varied questions that cover different aspects: origins, famous battles, leaders, cultural impacts, religious beliefs, historical periods, etc.

First question: Where was Normandy located? Answer: França (France).

Second question: When were the Normans in Normandy? They arrived during the 10th and 11th centuries.

Third question: From which countries did the Norsemen originate? Dinamarca (Denmark), Islândia (Iceland), e Noruega (Norway).

Fourth question: Who was a Viking leader? Could be a mix, but perhaps a general term like "mistura" (a blend) since the question in examples used that.

Fifth question: What century saw the Normans gaining distinct identity? Século X (10th century).

Sixth question: Who led the Norman forces in the Battle of Hastings? Guilherme, o Conquistador (William the Conqueror).

Seventh question: Who ruled the Duchy of Normandy? Ricardo I (Richard I).

Eighth question: What religion were the Normans? They followed Christianity.

Ninth question: What was the original meaning of the word "Norman"? It comes from "Viking."

Tenth question: When was the Latin version of "Norman" first recorded? Século IX (9th century).

I need to ensure each question is unique and directly related to the content. Also, check for any potential repetition or overlap in questions.
