Okay, I need to generate 10 pairs of questions and answers based on the given context about Warsaw (Varsóvia). Each question should be related to different aspects of the city, and each answer must be either explicit or inferable from the provided information.

8. **History**: When did Sigismund's Column in Warsaw happen?
9. **Current Events**: What happened during the 2014 Davis Cup in Warsaw?
10. **Climate**: Average temperature in Warsaw during a specific month.

Now, I'll pair each topic with an appropriate question and extract or infer the correct answer from the context:

1. **Question about location**: "Which area is located near Warsaw?" The context mentions that Warsaw is at the margin of the Vistula River, so the answer would be "Nearby the Vistula River."

7. **Company**: Rootwater's headquarters is in Warsaw.

8. **Historical Event**: Sigismund's Column was established in 1569.
