Okay, so I need to generate 10 pairs of questions and answers based on the provided context about the Black Death. The goal is to create a CSV file with each line containing a question and its correct answer, separated by a semicolon. 

First, I'll review the context given. The Black Death was a major pandemic in the 14th century, caused by Yersinia pestis, affecting Europe and beyond. It originated in Asia and spread via trade routes, especially through flea-infested rats on ships. The fatality rate was high, between 30% to 60% of Europe's population, and it had significant social, economic, and religious impacts.

I should make sure each question is unique and covers different aspects: causes, origins, spread methods, impact, outcomes, etc. I'll extract key facts from the context to form these questions.

Let me list possible questions:

1. What caused the Black Death?
2. Where did it originate?
3. How did it spread to Europe?
4. When was its peak in Europe?
5. What percentage of Europe's population died?
6. Which regions were affected outside Europe?
7. What economic impact did it have?
8. What social changes occurred?
9. How long did recovery take?
10. What are the modern implications?

Now, I'll convert these into Portuguese and ensure each has a correct answer from the context.

Wait, checking the example provided, some answers were in quotes, so I need to make sure my answers match exactly or closely based on the context.

I also need to avoid repeating similar questions and ensure variety. For instance, one about cause (bacteria), another about spread via fleas, etc.
