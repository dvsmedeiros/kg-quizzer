Okay, so the user is asking me to generate a set of 10 objective questions related to California's context. They want them in a specific CSV format with each question and answer separated by semicolons. I need to focus on different aspects of California to create varied and relevant questions.

First, I should consider various topics within California that are both informative and can be easily converted into multiple-choice or open-ended questions. Let me brainstorm some areas: climate, geography, history, technology, etc.

Climate is a big one. I can ask about the average temperature in different cities or affections. That's straightforward and gives immediate data for answers.

Next, agriculture is another key area. Questions could be about crop yields in specific states or types of crops available. This ties into their farming practices, which are important.

For geography, maybe a question about landforms or geographical features unique to California. I can also compare it with other regions like Texas or Arizona.

Technology and innovation might be interesting. Asking about tech companies in the region could provide insights into local development, although that's a bit more speculative compared to climate or agriculture.

I should ensure each question has a clear answer and that the responses are explicit enough without needing additional information beyond what's provided.

Let me also make sure I don't repeat questions too much. Each response needs to be unique based on different aspects of California.

Finally, I'll structure them all into the required CSV format with only the data, no extra explanations or comments.
