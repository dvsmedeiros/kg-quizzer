Okay, I need to generate 10 pairs of questions and answers based on the provided context and facts about Islamism. Let me start by understanding the context given.

The context mentions that Islamism is a political-religious ideology. Its supporters aim to implement Islamic law (sharia), promote a pan-Islamic unity, create Islamic states, and reject non-Muslim influences, especially Western ones. The facts list various organizations and their ideologies, as well as some images and templates used in Wikipedia for Islamism.

Now, I need to create questions that cover different aspects of Islamism. Let me think of possible angles: what is Islamism, its main goals, how it's implemented, its relationship with other groups, and specific examples from the facts.

Looking at the examples provided, they include questions about the definition, objectives, methods, and examples of organizations. So I should vary the questions to cover these areas without repetition.

First, I can start by defining Islamism. Then, its main objectives like implementing Sharia, pan-Islamic unity, creating Islamic states, and rejecting non-Muslim influences. Then, maybe how it's practiced, like through political parties or movements. Also, examples of organizations that follow Islamism, and perhaps how it's represented in images or templates.

I need to make sure each question is unique and relates directly to the content. Let me check the facts again to ensure accuracy. For example, the facts mention specific parties like Al Wefaq, 19th Division, etc., so a question about an example of an organization with Islamism as its ideology would be valid.

Also, the context mentions that Islamism uses certain Wikipedia templates, so a question about that could be relevant. Additionally, the images associated with Islamism, like the flag of Hamas or the Taliban, could be part of the questions.

I need to avoid repeating the same type of question. For instance, if I ask about the main goal, I shouldn't ask another question about the same goal. Instead, I can ask about the methods used, the rejection of influences, or the role of specific groups.

Let me start drafting the questions:

1. What is the main goal of Islamism in terms of governance? (Implementing Sharia)
2. What is the primary objective of Islamism regarding international relations? (Pan-Islamic unity)
3. Which organizations are associated with Islamism according to the facts? (Examples from the list)
4. What do Islamists emphasize in their political actions? (Implementation of Sharia)
5. How do Islamists view non-Muslim influences? (Reject them, especially Western)
6. What is one of the key strategies of Islamism? (Creating Islamic states)
7. What is the role of political parties in Islamism? (They are affiliated with Islamic movements)
8. What is an example of an organization with Islamism as its ideology? (Al Wefaq)
9. What are the main aspects of Islamic law (sharia) in Islamism? (It's the foundation for governance and society)
10. What is the relationship between Islamism and the rejection of Western influence? (They reject it entirely)

Wait, but some of these might be similar. Let me check if they cover different aspects. Maybe I can adjust the questions to ensure they're varied. Also, the examples should be specific, so using "Al Wefaq" as an example would be good. Also, the images and templates mentioned in the facts could be included, like the use of certain Wikipedia templates.

Alternatively, I can ask about the types of groups that follow Islamism, the methods they use, the rejection of certain influences, and the examples of organizations.

I need to make sure each question is distinct and covers different aspects. Let me list out 10 unique questions based on the facts and context.
