Okay, I need to create 10 objective questions and answers based on the given context about the IPCC. Let me start by understanding the context and facts provided.

First, I'll read through the context about the Painel Intergovernamental sobre Mudanças Climáticas (IPCC). It's an international scientific organization established in 1988 under the United Nations. Their main goal is to study climate change, its causes, effects, and propose solutions. They compile reports that help global policies.

Now, looking at the facts provided:

- The IPCC was created in 1988 by PNUMA and OMM.
- It synthesizes knowledge from scientists around the world.
- It's considered the highest authority on global warming.
- Five major reports have been published since 1990 (the first in 1990) up to 2014, with a few more documents.
- Filippo Giorgi is part of it and has a specific role as the first person function.
- It's categorized under various Wikidata templates like organization, personfunction, portal, etc.
- The official name is Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), abbreviated as IPCC.

From this, I can extract information about when it was established, its functions, roles of individuals, categories it belongs to, and the languages it uses in its website (English and Portuguese).

   - Options: a) United Nations; b) World Meteorological Organization (WMO); c) Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change itself; d) National Academy of Sciences

4. Who is part of the IPCC and has a specific role as Chair?
   - Options: a) Kevin E. Trenberth; b) Julie Arblaster; c) Sergej Gulev; d) All of the above
   - Correct answer: d) All of the above

5. The IPCC is categorized under which Wikidata template for its main activity?
