Okay, so I need to generate 10 question and answer pairs in CSV format based on the given context about oxygen. The questions should be varied and cover different aspects of the content provided. Each question must have a single correct answer that's explicit or inferable from the text.

First, I'll read through the context carefully to identify key points and facts. Let me list out some main ideas:

1. Oxygen is an element with atomic number 8.
2. It's part of the chalcogens group and is a reactive nonmetal.
3. It's the third most abundant element in the universe, after hydrogen and helium.
4. In Earth's crust, it makes up about half the mass as part of oxides.
5. O2 constitutes 20.8% of the atmosphere.
6. Oxygen was discovered by Carl Wilhelm Scheele and Joseph Priestley around 1773-1774.
7. Antoine Lavoisier named oxygen in 1777.
8. It's crucial for life as it's used in cellular respiration and photosynthesis.
9. Pure oxygen can be toxic at high concentrations.
10. Oxygen is a major component in the atmosphere, supporting combustion.

Now, I'll think of questions that cover these points without overlapping too much. Let me brainstorm:

- What is the atomic number of oxygen?
- Which element is the second most abundant in the universe after hydrogen?
- How much of Earth's crust does oxygen make up?
- What gas makes up about 20.8% of the atmosphere?
- Who named oxygen and when?
- In which group of elements is oxygen found?
- What is oxygen primarily used for in biological processes?
- What happens to oxygen under high pressure or concentration?
- How did early scientists contribute to our understanding of oxygen?
- Why is oxygen important in Earth's atmosphere?

Now, I'll structure these into questions and answers, ensuring they're clear and concise. I also need to check the context to make sure each answer is accurate.

Let me draft them:

1. What is the atomic number of oxygen? → 8.
2. Which element comes second in abundance after hydrogen in the universe? → Helium.
3. How much of Earth's crust does oxygen constitute? → Almost half.
4. What gas comprises approximately 20.8% of the atmosphere? → O2 (dioxide).
5. Who named oxygen and when? → Antoine Lavoisier, in 1777.
6. To which group on the periodic table does oxygen belong? → Chalcogens.
7. What is oxygen primarily used for in biological processes? → Cellular respiration.
8. What effect does high concentrations of oxygen have? → Toxicity at high levels.
9. Who were early discoverers of oxygen? → Carl Wilhelm Scheele and Joseph Priestley.
10. Why is oxygen important in Earth's atmosphere? → Supports life and combustion.

I think these cover a good range of topics without repeating the same information too much. Each question targets a specific fact from the context, ensuring variety and comprehensiveness.

Now, I'll format them into CSV pairs as required.
