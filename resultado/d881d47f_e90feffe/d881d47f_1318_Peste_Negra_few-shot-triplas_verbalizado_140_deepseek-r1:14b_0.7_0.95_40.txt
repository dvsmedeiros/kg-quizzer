Alright, so I need to generate 10 pairs of questions and answers based on the provided context about the Black Death. The user has given me a detailed description of the Black Death, including its origin, spread, impact, and aftermath. They also provided some examples of how the questions should look.

First, I'll start by reading through the context carefully to identify key points that can be turned into questions. The main areas to cover are the origin, causes, spread mechanisms, impact on population, economic effects, social changes, recurrence, and notable events or figures related to the Black Death.

Looking at the examples provided, I see that each question is clear and directly tied to a specific fact from the context. My goal is to create varied questions that touch on different aspects without repeating similar ones.

I'll begin by identifying key facts:

1. Origin: Asia Central/Oriental.
2. Cause: Yersinia pestis bacteria.
3. Spread: Via rats and fleas, particularly through trade routes like the Silk Road.
4. Impact: Killed 30-60% of Europe's population.
5. Economic effects: Labor shortages, wage increases, social changes.
6. Recurrence: Returned several times until the early 20th century.

Now, I'll formulate questions around these points:

1. Where did the Black Death likely originate?
   - From the context: Asia Central or Oriental.
   
2. What caused the Black Death?
   - Bacteria Yersinia pestis.

3. How did it spread to Europe?
   - Through rats and fleas on Genovese ships, via Mediterranean ports.

4. What percentage of Europe's population died?
   - 30% to 60%.

5. What economic effect did it cause in Europe?
   - Labor shortages leading to wage increases.

6. How long did the population take to recover in Europe?
   - About 200 years.

7. Which regions were hardest hit by the recurrence of the plague?
   - London in the 17th century, as noted in examples.

8. What was a social consequence of the Black Death?
   - Shift from feudalism due to labor shortages.

9. How many people worldwide died during the Black Death?
   - Between 75 and 200 million.

10. Which flea species was primarily responsible for spreading the plague?
    - Oriental rat flea (Xenopsylla chepsis).

I need to ensure each question is unique and covers different aspects without overlapping too much with others. I'll also check that each answer is directly supported by the provided context, either explicitly or inferentially.

Finally, I'll format these into CSV pairs as instructed, ensuring no additional explanations are included.
