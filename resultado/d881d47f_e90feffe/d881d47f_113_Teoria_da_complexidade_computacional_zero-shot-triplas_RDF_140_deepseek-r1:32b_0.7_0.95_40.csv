5. What is NP-completeness?;NP-completeness refers to a class of problems that are both NP-hard and verifiable in polynomial time.
6. Who introduced the concept of NP-completeness?;Steve Cook and Leonid Levin introduced the concept of NP-completeness.
7. What are the implications of proving P equals NP?;Proving P equals NP would imply that every problem whose solution can be verified quickly can also be solved quickly, revolutionizing fields like cryptography and optimization.
8. How does computational complexity theory relate to algorithm design?;It provides a framework for understanding the efficiency of algorithms and classifying problems based on their resource requirements.
9. What role do decision problems play in computational complexity?;Decision problems are central as they form the basis for defining complexity classes, helping to categorize problem difficulty.
10. Which researcher is known for work on probabilistically checkable proofs (PCPs)?;Shmuel Safra and others have contributed significantly to the understanding of PCPs.
