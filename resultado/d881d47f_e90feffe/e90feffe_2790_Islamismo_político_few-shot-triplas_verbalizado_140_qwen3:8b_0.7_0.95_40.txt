Okay, I need to generate 10 CSV entries based on the provided context and facts about Islamism. Let me start by understanding the context. The user mentioned that Islamism is a political-religious ideology aiming to implement Sharia, promote pan-Islamic unity, create Islamic states, and reject non-Muslim influences, especially Western ones.

Looking at the facts, there's a list of organizations and groups associated with Islamism. Each entry has a name and the fact that their ideology is Islamism. I need to create questions that ask about these groups, their associations, or aspects of Islamism.

First, I should vary the questions. For example, some could ask about specific groups, others about the goals of Islamism, or the rejection of certain influences. I need to ensure each question is unique and covers different aspects.

Let me check the examples given. The examples include questions about what Islamism is, its integration aspects, objectives, methods, etc. I should follow that structure but avoid repeating the same phrasing.

Now, I'll list possible questions. For example:

1. Which organization is associated with the ideology of Islamism? (Answer: Al Wefaq)
2. What is the main goal of Islamism regarding governance? (Answer: Implementation of Sharia)
3. Which group is linked to the rejection of Western influence? (Answer: Al Qaeda in the Indian subcontinent)
4. What do Islamic movements seek to establish? (Answer: Islamic states)
5. Which organization is part of the Islamic Revolution? (Answer: Islamic Action Society)
6. What is the stance of Islamism towards non-Muslim influences? (Answer: Rejection)
7. Which group is associated with the Islamic Revolution in the Arabian Peninsula? (Answer: Organization for the Islamic Revolution in the Arabian Peninsula)
8. What is the main focus of the Islamism ideology? (Answer: Implementation of Sharia)
9. Which political party in Egypt follows Islamism? (Answer: Islamic Party (Egypt))
10. What is the primary objective of the Islamism movement? (Answer: Creation of Islamic states)

Wait, I need to make sure each answer is directly from the facts. Let me cross-verify each answer against the provided data. For example, the answer to question 1 should be Al Wefaq, which is listed in the facts. Similarly, the Islamic Party (Egypt) is mentioned. The Organization for the Islamic Revolution in the Arabian Peninsula is also listed. I should ensure that each answer is a specific group or aspect mentioned in the facts.

Let me structure the CSV entries now, making sure each question is unique and the answers are correct based on the given data.
