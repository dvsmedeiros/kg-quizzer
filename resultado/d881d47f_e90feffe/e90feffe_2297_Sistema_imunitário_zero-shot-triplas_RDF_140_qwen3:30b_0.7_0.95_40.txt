Okay, the user wants me to generate 10 pairs of questions and answers in CSV format based on the provided context and facts. Let me start by understanding the requirements thoroughly.

First, the context is about the immune system, its components, functions, and related concepts. The facts include various entities linked to the immune system in a structured format. The user specified that each question must be relevant, varied, and cover different aspects of the content. Also, the answers must be explicitly or inferentially derived from the context.

I need to ensure that I don't repeat similar questions. Let me go through the context again to identify key points. The immune system's role in protecting against diseases, its components like B cells, T cells, macrophages, mechanisms like phagocytosis and complement system, the concept of adaptive immunity, vaccination, autoimmune diseases, immunodeficiency, and the scientists mentioned like Mechnikov, Milstein, etc.

Now, I'll brainstorm possible questions. For example, who is the father of immunology? What are the components of the immune system? How does the immune system recognize pathogens? What is adaptive immunity? What are examples of autoimmune diseases? How do vaccines work? What is immunodeficiency? What are the basic immune mechanisms in eukaryotes? What is the role of the complement system? How do unicellular organisms have an immune system?

Wait, I need to check if these questions are all covered in the context. The context mentions Mechnikov as the father, components like B cells, T cells, macrophages, mechanisms like phagocytosis, complement, and the immune system in unicellular organisms. Autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis and type 1 diabetes are mentioned. Vaccination is linked to adaptive immunity. Immunodeficiency is discussed in the context of HIV and genetic disorders. The complement system is mentioned as a basic mechanism. Unicellular organisms have enzymes against bacteriophages.

I need to make sure each question is unique and covers different aspects. Let me list 10:

1. Who is considered the father of immunology? (Answer: Ilya Ilyich Mechnikov)
2. What are the two main types of immune mechanisms? (Innate and adaptive)
3. What is the role of B cells? (Produce antibodies)
4. What is the process of creating immunological memory called? (Adaptive immunity)
5. What is an example of an autoimmune disease? (Rheumatoid arthritis)
6. How do vaccines work? (Stimulate adaptive immunity)
7. What causes immunodeficiency? (Genetic, HIV, immunosuppressants)
8. What is the function of the complement system? (Enhance phagocytosis)
9. How do unicellular organisms defend against pathogens? (Enzymes against bacteriophages)
10. What is the primary function of the immune system? (Protect against diseases)

Wait, the context mentions "fagocitose, os peptídeos antimicrobianos designados defensinas, e o sistema complemento" as basic mechanisms. So the complement system is part of innate immunity. Also, the immune system's ability to adapt is part of adaptive immunity. The context says the immune system must detect various agents and distinguish them from the body's tissue. 

I need to make sure the answers are directly from the context. For example, the answer to the father of immunology is explicitly stated. The complement system is mentioned as a basic mechanism. The answer to the question about unicellular organisms is enzymes against bacteriophages. 

Let me check each question and answer against the context to ensure accuracy. Also, avoid using any information from the facts section, as the user wants the questions based only on the context provided. The facts section has DBpedia links, but I shouldn't use that unless it's in the context. The context mentions specific terms like "fagocitose", "defensinas", "sistema complemento", "imunidade adquirida", "vacinação", "doenças autoimunes", "imunodeficiência", etc.

I need to phrase the questions in Portuguese, as per the user's instruction. Let me translate the questions accordingly. For example, "What is the role of B cells?" becomes "Qual é o papel das células B?".

Now, compiling the CSV format, ensuring each line is "pergunta;resposta" without any extra text. Let me verify that there are exactly 10 pairs and that they are all unique and cover different aspects.
