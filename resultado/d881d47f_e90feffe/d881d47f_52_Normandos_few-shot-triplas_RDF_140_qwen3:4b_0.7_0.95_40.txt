Okay, the user wants me to generate 10 quiz questions and answers in CSV format based on the provided context about the Normans. Let me start by carefully reading the context and facts given.

First, the context mentions that the Normans were a Germanic people in northern France, with their aristocracy coming from Vikings. They played significant roles in medieval Europe, including the Norman Conquest of England, Sicily, and the Crusades. There are also various historical events and places associated with them, like the Battle of Hastings, the Hauteville family, and architectural styles.

Now, I need to make sure the questions cover different aspects. The examples given include questions about origin, time periods, leaders, religious beliefs, and specific events. Let me think of 10 unique questions that are based on the facts provided.

Looking at the facts, there are mentions of the Normans being related to the Vikings, their origin in northern France, their role in the Crusades, the Battle of Hastings, the Hauteville family, the Siege of Mahdia, and architectural styles. Also, their languages include Latin, Old Norman, and Old Norse. Their religion was Christianity and Norse paganism. The name "Norman" comes from "Northmen" or "Norsemen."

I should avoid repeating similar questions. For example, one question could be about the origin of the term "Norman," another about their relation to Vikings, another about the Norman Conquest, and so on. Let me check each fact to ensure the questions are accurate and based on the provided data.

Let me list possible questions:

1. Where is the Normandia located? (France)
2. What is the origin of the term "Norman"? (Northmen)
3. Which battle is associated with the Norman Conquest of England? (Hastings)
4. What is the religious belief of the Normans? (Christianity and Norse paganism)
5. Who was the leader of the Normans in the Battle of Hastings? (William the Conqueror)
6. What is the significance of the Hauteville family? (Norman ethnicity)
7. What is the architectural style of St. Mary's Church in Mortehoe? (Normans)
8. What was the primary language of the Normans? (Latin)
9. Which historical event is linked to the Normans in the Mediterranean? (Crusades)
10. What is the name of the castle in the Bayeux Tapestry? (Dinan)

Wait, the example given in the user's examples includes a question about the century when they gained their identity. But in the context, it's not explicitly stated. However, the fact says "séculos 10 e" in the example, so maybe that's a reference to the 10th century. But the user's example might be outdated. Let me check the facts again.

The facts mention the Battle of Hastings in 1066, so that's a key point. The Normans were established in Normandy in the 10th century. So a question about when they established their identity could be in the 10th century. But the user's example says "séculos 10 e" (centuries 10 and...), but maybe that's a typo. However, the user's example might have a mistake, but I need to follow the provided facts.

Another point is that the Normans were related to the Vikings, so a question about their origin. Also, the Hauteville family is mentioned as having Norman ethnicity. The Siege of Mahdia is a battle involving Normans. The architectural styles like St. Bride's Church in Llansantffraed are Norman. The languages include Latin, Old Norman, and Old Norse.

I need to make sure each question is unique and based on the facts. Let me compile the 10 questions now, making sure they are all distinct and accurate.
