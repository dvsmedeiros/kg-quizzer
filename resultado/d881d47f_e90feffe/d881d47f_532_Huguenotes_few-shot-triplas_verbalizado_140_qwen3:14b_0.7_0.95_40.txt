Okay, let's see. The user wants me to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the provided context and facts. The context is about the Huguenots, their history, persecution, and migration. The facts include a lot of Wikipedia template information, images, categories, and related topics.

First, I need to make sure each question is relevant to the context and uses the facts provided. The questions should be varied and cover different aspects. Let me start by listing key points from the context: Huguenots were French Protestants in the 16th century, they faced persecution under Louis XIV, the Edict of Nantes was revoked in 1685, they were mostly Calvinists, and some areas had Lutheran Germans.

Now, the facts include things like the number of Huguenots who left France (300,000), the revocation of the Edict of Nantes, their religious affiliation (Calvinist), regions like Alsace, Moselle, Montbéliard with Lutheran Huguenots. Also, there are mentions of places named after them, like Orange County, New York, Staten Island, and some images and categories related to them.

I need to avoid repeating similar questions. For example, not just asking about the Edict of Nantes multiple times. Let me think of different angles: their religious beliefs, the number of people who left, the reasons for migration, regions with different denominations, historical events, related topics like Scotch-Irish Americans, and the impact of the revocation.

Wait, the user mentioned that each answer must be explicitly or inferably from the context. So I can't make up information. Let me check each fact again. For example, the context says they were mostly Calvinists and members of the Reformed Church, while in Alsace, Moselle, etc., they were Lutheran Germans. That's a good point for a question.

Another fact is the revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685 by Louis XIV. That's a key event. Also, the number of Huguenots who left France (300,000). The regions where they were located: parts of France, Alsace, Moselle, Montbéliard. The connection to Scotch-Irish Americans. The names of places named after them.

I need to ensure that each question is unique. Let me draft some:

1. Qual foi a data da revogação do Édito de Nantes? -> 18 de outubro de 1685.
2. Qual foi a principal denominação religiosa dos Huguenotes? -> Calvinista.
3. Quantos Huguenotes deixaram a França após a revogação do Édito de Nantes? -> Cerca de 300.000.
4. Quais regiões da França tinham Huguenotes majoritariamente luteranos? -> Alsácia, Moselle e Montbéliard.
5. Qual foi a causa principal da emigração dos Huguenotes? -> Perseguições religiosas sob Luís XIV e revogação do Édito de Nantes.
6. Qual é a denominação religiosa predominante entre os Huguenotes da Alsácia? -> Luteranos.
7. Que evento histórico levou à expulsão dos Huguenotes da França? -> Revogação do Édito de Nantes em 1685.
8. Quais regiões da França eram dominadas por Huguenotes calvinistas? -> Partes sul e central da França.
9. Qual movimento religioso está associado aos Huguenotes? -> Reforma Protestante.
10. Quais são exemplos de lugares nos Estados Unidos nomeados em homenagem aos Huguenotes? -> Orange County, New York e Staten Island.

Now, I need to check if all these answers are directly from the context or can be inferred. For example, the question about the regions with Lutheran Huguenotes is from the context. The number of 300,000 is mentioned. The Edict revocation date is given. The connection to Scotch-Irish is in the facts but not in the context. Wait, the context doesn't mention Scotch-Irish, but the facts do. The user said to use the context and facts provided. So maybe including that as a question is okay if the context doesn't have it but the facts do. However, the user said to base on context and facts. Hmm, but the example questions didn't use the facts beyond the context. Maybe better to stick to context. The example questions used the context. Let me check again.

The context says: "Huguenotes eram os protestantes franceses durante as guerras religiosas na França (segunda metade do século XVI). Cerca de 300 000 deles deixaram a França, após as (perseguições contra as comunidades protestantes, sob Luís XIV) e a revogação do Édito de Nantes, em 18 de outubro de 1685. Eram majoritariamente calvinistas e membros da Igreja Reformada, enquanto os protestantes das regiões da Alsácia, Moselle e Montbéliard eram majoritariamente alemães luteranos."

So from the context, I can use the number of 300,000, the reasons for leaving (persecutions and revocation), the religious denominations (Calvinist and Lutheran in specific regions), the Edict revocation date, and the regions. The facts also mention Scotch-Irish Americans being related, but the context doesn't mention that. However, the user said to use both context and facts. But the example questions didn't include the facts beyond the context. Maybe the user expects using the context, but since the instruction says to use context and facts, I need to include facts as well. However, the example questions are based on the context. Hmm.

Wait, the user's instruction says: "Gere pares de perguntas e respostas relevantes e corretas, exclusivamente a partir do conteúdo fornecido." So only from the content provided, which includes both context and facts. So if the facts mention Scotch-Irish Americans are related, that's part of the content. So maybe that's a valid question. Let me check that.

In the facts: "Scotch-Irish Americans está relacionado a Huguenots" and again later. So a question could be: "Quais grupos étnicos estão relacionados aos Huguenotes?" with answer "Scotch-Irish Americans". But the example questions didn't include that. But the user's instruction says to use the facts. So maybe that's acceptable. However, the example questions are based on the context, not the facts. The user might expect using the context, but the instruction says to use the content provided, which includes facts. So perhaps including that is okay.

But to be safe, maybe focus more on the context. Let me see. The user provided the context and then the facts. The facts include a lot of Wikipedia templates and image info, which might not be relevant for the questions. But the user also included the facts in the content provided. So perhaps the answer to a question about the number of Huguenots who left is from the context. The facts also mention "Huguenots possui assunto Category:French Wars of Religion", but that's probably not needed for the questions. The main info is in the context. So I think focusing on the context is better for the questions.

So my initial 10 questions seem okay. Let me check again for repetition. The first question is about the Edict's revocation date. The second about their denomination. Third about the number. Fourth about regions with Lutherans. Fifth about the cause of migration. Sixth about the denomination in Alsace. Seventh about the event leading to expulsion. Eighth about regions with Calvinists. Ninth about the religious movement. Tenth about places named after them. That's 10 unique questions. Each answer is from the context. I think that's acceptable. Now, format them as CSV with semicolons.
