Okay, I need to help generate 10 objective questions and answers based on the provided context about Ctenophora. The user has given specific instructions, so I should follow them carefully.

First, I'll review the context to understand what information is available. It's mainly about Ctenophora, also known as carambolas-do-mar or águas-vivas-de-pente. These are marine invertebrates that are planctonic or benthic, bioluminescent, and have pentes with ciliophores for movement. They're the largest non-colonial animals, ranging from about 1 mm to 1.5 m in size. They look similar to medusas but are more related to Cnidaria through convergent evolution.

Looking at the facts provided, there's some DBpedia information that can be used. For example, <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vallicula> is a hypernym of Ctenophora. Also, several species like Coelenterata, Coeloplana, Vallicula are related to Ctenophora.

Now, I need to create 10 questions that cover various aspects of the context. Each question should have one correct answer based on the provided facts or knowledge about Ctenophora.

I'll start by identifying key points:
- Name and common names
- Habitat (águas oceânicas e estuarianas)
- Size range
- Movement using cílios
- Bioluminescent characteristic
- Presence of pentes
- Evolutionary relationships with medusas
- Hypernyms in the taxonomy
- Common taxonomic divisions (Order, Family, Genus, Species)

I should structure each question around these points. For example, a question about the size range or the habitat.

Let me draft some questions and answers:

1. **What is the scientific name for Ctenophora?**
   - **Answer:** *Comb jellies*

2. **What is another common name for Ctenophora?**
   - **Answer:** Águas-vivas-de-pente

3. **What is the size range of Ctenophora species?**
   - **Answer:** De cerca de 1 mm a 1,5 m de comprimento

4. **What habitat do Ctenophora typically live in?**
   - **Answer:** Águas oceânicas e estuarianas

5. **Which organism is known for being bioluminescent and having pentes with cílios?**
   - **Answer:** Ctenophora

6. **What is the scientific classification of Ctenophora (e.g., Order, Family)?**
   - **Answer:** Ctenophore101918744

7. **Which species or genus is a hypernym for Ctenophora?**
   - **Answer:** Vallicula

8. **What type of animal are Ctenophora considered to be?**
   - **Answer:** Bioluminescent ctensor

Wait, that might not make sense. Let me think again.

Ctenophora is a genus within the phylum Coelenterata, which includes cnidarians. So maybe rephrase:

8. **What phylum do Ctenophora belong to?**
   - **Answer:** Coelenterata

9. **What kind of organism are Pentes in Ctenophora for?**
   - **Answer:** Utilizar cílios para nadar

10. **How many subdivisions does the taxonomic classification of Ctenophora include, and what is an example?**
    - **Answer:** Tentaculata; Nuda; Scleroctenophora (subdivisiones)

I think these cover different aspects: name, common names, size, habitat, characteristics, relationships with other organisms, taxonomic classification.

Let me ensure each answer directly relates to the context or facts provided. For example, using the hypernym Vallicula as a related species and confirming Ctenophora's phylum.
