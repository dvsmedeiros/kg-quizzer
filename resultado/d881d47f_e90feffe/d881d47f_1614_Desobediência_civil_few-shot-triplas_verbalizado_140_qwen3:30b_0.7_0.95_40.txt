Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to generate 10 pairs of questions and answers in CSV format based on the provided context and facts about civil disobedience. First, I need to make sure I understand the context and facts thoroughly.

The context says that civil disobedience is a peaceful political protest against unjust laws or oppressive governments. It mentions Henry David Thoreau as the original concept, Gandhi's use in India's independence, and Martin Luther King's role in the US civil rights movement. Also, it states that if a government doesn't meet the population's needs, the people have the right to disobey.

Looking at the facts, there are a lot of examples of protests and movements that used civil disobedience, like the 2021 End SARS memorial protest, Assam Movement, various anti-corruption protests, and others. There are also mentions of models used on Wikipedia pages, people associated with civil disobedience, and specific events.

Now, I need to create 10 unique questions and answers. The questions should cover different aspects of the content. Let me start by identifying key points from the context and facts.

First, the originators: Thoreau, Gandhi, MLK. So questions about who formulated the concept, who applied it successfully, etc.

Then, examples of movements: Assam Movement, End SARS, etc. So questions about specific events.

Also, the nature of civil disobedience: peaceful, against unjust laws, right to disobey.

Other aspects: the purpose, methods, related terms (like "refusal" as a hypernym), and specific instances like the 2021 Montenegrin episcopal enthronement protests.

I need to ensure that each question is different and covers various parts of the content. Let me list possible questions:

1. Who is credited with formulating the concept of civil disobedience?
2. Which historical figure applied civil disobedience in the Indian independence movement?
3. What is an example of a protest that used civil disobedience methods?
4. What is the main purpose of civil disobedience according to the context?
5. Which event involved civil disobedience against corruption in Montenegro?
6. What is the term for the right of a population to disobey an unsatisfactory government?
7. Who was a key figure in the US civil rights movement using civil disobedience?
8. What is the hypernym of civil disobedience mentioned in the facts?
9. Which protest in 2021 used civil disobedience methods?
10. What is the main characteristic of civil disobedience as described?

Now, check if the answers are in the context or facts. For example, Thoreau is mentioned in the context and in the facts (Henry David Thoreau possui ideia notável Civil disobedience). Gandhi is in the context. The Assam Movement is in the facts. The 2021 End SARS is in the facts. The right to disobey is in the context. MLK is in the context. The hypernym is "refusal" as per the fact "Civil disobedience possui hiperônimo Refusal". The 2021 Montenegrin episcopal enthronement protests are in the facts. The main characteristic is "peaceful" as per the context.

Now, make sure the answers are correct and directly from the content. Avoid repetition. Check for 10 unique questions. Let me structure them into CSV format now.
