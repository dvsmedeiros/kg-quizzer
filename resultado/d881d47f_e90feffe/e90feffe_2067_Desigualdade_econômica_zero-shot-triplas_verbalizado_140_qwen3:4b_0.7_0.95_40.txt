Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the provided context and facts. Let me start by understanding the user's request.

The user provided a detailed context about economic inequality, including various aspects like distribution of income, wealth, consumption, measurement methods (Gini coefficient, HDI), and related topics. There are also a list of facts that mention different models, images, categories, and people associated with economic inequality.

The task is to create 10 pairs of questions and answers. The questions must be varied and cover different aspects of the content. Each question should have a single correct answer that is explicitly or inferably from the given context. I need to avoid repeating similar questions and ensure that the answers are directly derived from the facts and context provided.

First, I'll look through the context and facts to identify key points. The main elements include:

1. Definitions of economic inequality (income vs. wealth).
2. Measurement methods: Gini coefficient, HDI.
3. Global vs. national inequality.
4. Social factors (e.g., Occupy movements, Land Reform Movement).
5. Related concepts: equity, equality of opportunity, results.
6. People and works associated with economic inequality (Branko Milanović, Robert Wade, Mick Moore, etc.).
7. Images and categories (e.g., Skid Row tents, Holmby Hills mansion).
8. Other uses and models (templates, categories, etc.).

I need to make sure each question is unique and covers different aspects. Let me list possible questions:

1. What are the two main measures of economic inequality mentioned in the context?
2. Which index is used to measure economic inequality, considering both wealth and income distribution?
3. What is the primary difference between global and national economic inequality?
4. Which movement is associated with economic inequality as a cause?
5. Who is a scholar associated with the study of economic inequality?
6. What is an example of an image related to economic inequality?
7. What is the term used to describe the concept of fairness in economic contexts?
8. Which book or work is associated with the study of economic inequality?
9. What is the main focus of the "The Hidden Wealth of Nations" work?
10. What is the term used to describe the unequal distribution of wealth among different groups?

Now, I need to ensure that each answer is directly from the context or facts. Let me check each answer against the provided information.

1. The context mentions distribution of income (renta) and wealth (riqueza). So the answer is correct.
2. The HDI index is mentioned as a composite statistic considering inequality. Correct.
3. Global inequality is reduced between countries, while within countries it's increased. Correct.
4. The Occupy movements (e.g., Occupy Atlanta) are mentioned as having economic inequality as a cause. Correct.
5. Branko Milanović is a scholar in this area. Correct.
6. The image "20220801 Economic stratification - cross-class friendships - bar chart.svg" is an example. Correct.
7. The concept of equity is mentioned. Correct.
8. "The Rich and the Rest of Us" is a work associated. Correct.
9. "The Hidden Wealth of Nations" deals with non-fictional topics related to economic inequality. Correct.
10. The term is "desigualdade" (economic inequality). Correct.

I need to make sure all answers are in Portuguese and follow the CSV format. Also, check for any possible duplicates or overlapping questions. The user specified that the answers must be from the given context, so I need to ensure that each answer is directly from the facts provided. For example, the answer about the Gini coefficient is mentioned in the context as the most used measure. The answer about the "Occupy" movements is from the fact list. The answer about the "The Hidden Wealth of Nations" is from the fact list. The answer about the term "desigualdade" is directly from the context.

I think these 10 questions cover different aspects: definitions, measurement, causes, associated works, people, images, and concepts. They are all unique and based on the provided facts. Now, I'll format them into the CSV structure as requested.
