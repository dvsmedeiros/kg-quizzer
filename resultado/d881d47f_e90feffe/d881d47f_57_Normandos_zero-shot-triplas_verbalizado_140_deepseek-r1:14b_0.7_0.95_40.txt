Okay, so I need to create a CSV file with exactly 10 pairs of questions and answers based on the provided context about Normans. The user has given specific instructions, so I should make sure to follow them closely.

First, I'll read through the context again to understand what information is available. It mentions that Normans were a Germanic people established in northern France, with aristocracy descending from Viking expeditions. They played significant roles in medieval Europe and the Middle East, including colonizing Normandy, conquering England, and establishing states in Sicily and southern Italy. Their rich history led to various legends.

Looking at the facts provided, there's a lot of information about their origins, religion, language, architecture, and notable figures. There are also mentions of specific places associated with Normans, battles they were involved in, and the languages they spoke.

Now, I need to generate 10 unique questions that cover different aspects of this content. Each question should have one correct answer derived from the provided facts. I'll make sure not to repeat similar questions and vary the topics between history, culture, language, architecture, etc.

Let me start brainstorming possible questions:

1. **Ethnic Origin**: Since Normans are described as Germanic, that's a good point.
2. **Religion Over Time**: They started with Norse paganism but later adopted Christianity, so a question about their main religion.
3. **Language Spoken**: Old Norse is mentioned, and later Old Norman and Latin.
4. **Historical Event**: The conquest of England by Normans under William the Conqueror is a key event.
5. **Building Style**: They had distinct architectural styles in churches like St Mary's Church, Mortehoe.
6. **Notable Figure**: Richard of Salerno was a Norman with significance in southern Italy.
7. **Expansion Area**: Sicily and southern Italy were major areas they colonized.
8. **Religious Transition**: From Norse paganism to Christianity.
9. **Castles Built**: Examples like Taunton Castle are mentioned.
10. **Modern Influence**: The Normans' influence on languages like Jèrriais and Guernésiais.

I should ensure each question is clear and the answer is directly supported by the facts given. I'll structure each line as "pergunta;resposta" without any additional text, just 10 lines in CSV format.
