Okay, I need to generate 10 question and answer pairs in Portuguese based on the given context and facts about the Amazon rainforest. Let me start by reading through the context carefully to understand the key points.

The context mentions that the Amazon is a tropical rainforest covering the Amazon Basin, spanning 7 million km², with 5.5 million km² of forest. It's part of nine countries, mostly Brazil (60%), then Peru (13%), and others. It's the largest biome in Brazil, covering 49.29% of the territory. There's also info about UNESCO recognition, the "Amazônia Legal" area, and some specific facts like the 2000 UNESCO designation, the 2008 candidate for Natural Wonders, and the 6 million hectares in the Jaú National Park.

Now, the facts provided are more technical, like the use of wikimedia templates, images, coordinates, and some specific data points. However, the user wants questions based on the context, not the facts. Wait, the user said "exclusivamente a partir do conteúdo fornecido" which is the context and facts. But the facts seem to be more about the wiki page structure, which might not be relevant for general knowledge questions. However, the user might want to include both. Wait, the initial instructions say "based on context and facts provided." So I need to use both the context and the facts.

But looking at the facts, some are about the wiki page (like templates, images, coordinates), which might not be suitable for general knowledge questions. However, the user might expect some questions based on the facts. For example, the coordinates, the countries it spans, the percentage in Brazil, etc.

But the user's example in the context is about the Amazon's geographical and ecological aspects. So I should focus on that. Let me list possible questions:

1. Which country has the largest portion of the Amazon rainforest?
   Answer: Brasil (60%)

2. What is the total area of the Amazon Basin?
   Answer: 7 milhões de quilômetros quadrados

3. What percentage of the Amazon is covered by the rainforest?
   Answer: 5,5 milhões de quilômetros quadrados

4. Which country has the second-largest portion of the Amazon?
   Answer: Peru (13%)

5. What is the name of the area in Brazil that defines the Amazon?
   Answer: Amazônia Legal

6. Which biome is the Amazon considered in Brazil?
   Answer: O maior bioma terrestre do país

7. What is the UNESCO designation for part of the Amazon?
   Answer: Patrimônio da Humanidade (Parque Nacional do Jaú)

8. Which country is not part of the Amazon's coverage?
   Answer: (But the context lists nine countries, so maybe a question about which is not included, but the facts mention Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, French Guiana, Guyana, Peru, Suriname, and Venezuela. So maybe a question about which is not in the list.)

Wait, the context says "inclui territórios pertencentes a nove nações" and lists Brazil, Peru, Colombia, Venezuela, Equador, Bolívia, Guiana, Suriname, França (Guiana Francesa). So the answer would be a country not in that list. But the user wants the answer to be from the content. However, the user's instruction says "resposta correta" must be explicit or inferable. So maybe a question like "Which of the following is NOT part of the Amazon's coverage?" but since the user wants exactly 10 pairs, maybe better to stick to explicit info.

Another question: What is the name of the protected area in the Amazon recognized by UNESCO? Answer: Parque Nacional do Jaú.

Another fact from the context: The Amazon is the largest biome in Brazil, covering 49.29% of the territory. So a question could be "What is the percentage of Brazil's territory covered by the Amazon biome?" Answer: 49,29%.

Also, the Amazon is part of the Neotropical ecoregions, as per the facts. So a question could be "What ecoregion does the Amazon belong to?" Answer: Neotropical ecoregions.

But I need to ensure that all answers are directly from the context or facts. Let me check each point again.

Another point: The Amazon is a tropical rainforest, so a question could be "What type of biome is the Amazon?" Answer: Floresta tropical.

Also, the coordinates given in the facts are -3.0 -60.0, so a question could be "What are the coordinates of the Amazon rainforest?" Answer: -3.0 -60.0.

But the user might prefer questions based on the context rather than the facts. However, the user said to use both. So I need to balance.

Let me compile 10 questions:

1. Which country has the largest portion of the Amazon rainforest?
   Answer: Brasil (60%)

2. What is the total area of the Amazon Basin?
   Answer: 7 milhões de quilômetros quadrados

3. What percentage of the Amazon is covered by the rainforest?
   Answer: 5,5 milhões de quilômetros quadrados

4. Which country has the second-largest portion of the Amazon?
   Answer: Peru (13%)

5. What is the name of the area in Brazil that defines the Amazon?
   Answer: Amazônia Legal

6. What biome is the Amazon considered in Brazil?
   Answer: O maior bioma terrestre do país

7. What UNESCO designation does part of the Amazon have?
   Answer: Patrimônio da Humanidade (Parque Nacional do Jaú)

8. What is the percentage of Brazil's territory covered by the Amazon biome?
   Answer: 49,29%

9. What is the name of the protected area in the Amazon recognized by UNESCO?
   Answer: Parque Nacional do Jaú

10. What are the coordinates of the Amazon rainforest?
    Answer: -3.0 -60.0

I need to check if these answers are present in the context or facts. The context mentions the 60% for Brazil, 7 million km², 5.5 million km², Peru 13%, Amazônia Legal, largest biome, UNESCO designation for Jaú, 49.29%, and the coordinates in the facts. So yes, all answers are covered. Now, I need to present them as "pergunta;resposta" pairs, ensuring they are in Portuguese and correctly formatted.
