Okay, I need to generate 10 pairs of questions and answers based on the provided context about packet switching. Let me start by understanding the context thoroughly.

The context explains that packet switching is a paradigm in computer networks where packets are individually routed through the network. It contrasts with circuit switching, which creates dedicated links for data transmission. Packet switching optimizes bandwidth use, reduces latency, and increases robustness but introduces jitter and variable delay. Techniques like multiplexing allow efficient resource use.

Looking at the facts provided, there's information about notable contributors like Donald Davies, Paul Baran, Sharla Boehm, W. David Sincoskie, and references to their work on packet switching. There are also mentions of specific protocols such as ATM (Cellular), Frame Relay, X.25, and examples like end-to-end addressing in datagram systems.

Now, I'll brainstorm different aspects related to packet switching that can be turned into questions:

1. What is packet switching?
   - This asks for a definition.
   
2. Compare advantages of circuit vs. packet switching.
   - A question about contrasting benefits.
   
3. Example of packet switching application.
   - Looking at the facts, ATM (Cellular) and Frame Relay are examples mentioned.

4. Who contributed to packet switching development?
   - The context lists several people like Donald Davies and Paul Baran.

5. How does packet switching reduce latency?
   - Explaining a mechanism or benefit.

6. Mention of end-to-end addressing in datagrams.
   - From the context, datagram systems require end addresses.

7. What is the primary use of X.25?
   - A specific application mentioned.

8. Difference between circuit and packet switching.
   - Clarifying their contrasts.

9. Mention of Frame Relay protocol.
   - Another specific example from the facts.

10. How does multiplexing help in packet switching.
    - Explaining a technique's benefit.

Now, I'll ensure each question is clear, relates to the context, and has an explicit or inferable answer without repetition.
