   - Answer: 50 (Wait, how many primes are there? Let's count. The primes listed in the data are: 11,13,17,19,23,29,31,37,41,43,47,53,59,61,67,71,73,83,89,97,109,113,127,131,137,139,149,151,157,163,167,173,179,181,193. Let's count: 11 is 1, 13 is 2, 17 is 3, 19 is 4, 23 is 5, 29 is 6, 31 is 7, 37 is 8, 41 is 9, 43 is 10, 47 is 11, 53 is 12, 59 is 13, 61 is 14, 67 is 15, 71 is 16, 73 is 17, 83 is 18, 89 is 19, 97 is 20, 109 is 21, 113 is 22, 127 is 23, 131 is 24, 137 is 25, 139 is 26, 149 is 27, 151 is 28, 157 is 29, 163 is 30, 167 is 31, 173 is 32, 179 is 33, 181 is 34, 193 is 35. So total of 35 primes. But wait, the user's data includes 193 as the last in the list. Then there's 2,147,483,647, which is a separate entry. So total primes listed in the data are 35 plus 1 (the Mersenne prime) making 36? Or is the Mersenne prime part of the list? The user's data has the primes listed up to 193, and then separately 2,147,483,647. So the answer would be 35 primes in the list, plus 1 more if that's included. But the user's instruction says "pergunta;resposta" in Portuguese. So the question is about the list in "Fatos sobre n√∫meros primos", which includes the 35 primes and 2,147,483,647? Wait, the user's data shows the primes up to 193, then the Mersenne prime is listed separately. So the count is 35 primes in the list, and the Mersenne is an additional one. But the user's data shows the primes listed in the Turtle triples as separate entries. For example, <http://dbpedia.org/resource/2,147,483,647> ns1:factorization <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Prime_number> . So that's another prime. So total primes listed in the data are 35 (from the list) + 1 (the Mersenne) = 36. But I need to check the exact count. Let me recount the primes in the data:
