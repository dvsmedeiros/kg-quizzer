Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to generate 10 CSV pairs of questions and answers based on the provided context about the Yuan Dynasty. First, I need to parse the context and the facts given. The main points are that the Yuan Dynasty was founded by Kublai Khan in 1271, it's a Mongol dynasty, and it lasted until 1368. There are also various facts about battles, people, and events related to the dynasty.

I need to make sure each question is unique and covers different aspects. Let me list possible questions. For example, who founded it? When was it established? What was the capital? What was the currency? Which battles involved the Yuan Dynasty? Who were some key figures? What was the dissolution year? What was the territory? Any notable events or places?

Looking at the facts, there are mentions of battles like Battle of Bạch Đằng, Battle of Lake Poyang, and the Mongol conquest of China. Also, there are references to emperors like Kublai Khan and his death place. The dynasty's dissolution year is 1368. The capital was Khanbaliq, and the currency was banknotes. There's also the Red Turban Rebellions mentioned.

I need to ensure each question is distinct. Let's start with the founding and establishment. Then move to key figures, events, locations, and other attributes. Check that each answer is directly from the context. Avoid repetition. Let me structure the CSV pairs accordingly, making sure the format is correct with semicolons and Portuguese language. Let me verify each answer is accurate based on the provided data.
