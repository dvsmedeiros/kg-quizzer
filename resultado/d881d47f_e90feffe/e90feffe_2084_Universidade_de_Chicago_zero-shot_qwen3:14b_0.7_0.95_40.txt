Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the context provided, which is about the University of Chicago. Let me start by recalling what I know about the University of Chicago. 

First, the university is located in Chicago, Illinois, USA. That's a basic fact, so maybe a question about its location. Next, the university was founded in 1890, so that's another point. The university is known for its strong programs in economics, business, and law. The Booth School of Business is a notable part of the university. The university has a strong research focus, especially in the social sciences. The main campus is on the South Side of Chicago. The university has produced many Nobel laureates, including economists like Milton Friedman. The mascot is the "Maroons," and the athletic teams are called the "Chicago Maroons." The university is part of the Association of American Universities. The library system includes the Regenstein Library, which is a major research library.

Now, I need to make sure each question is unique and covers different aspects. Let me list out possible questions:

1. Where is the University of Chicago located?
2. When was the University of Chicago founded?
3. Which school of business is part of the University of Chicago?
4. What is the nickname of the University of Chicago's athletic teams?
5. What is the name of the main library on the University of Chicago campus?
6. Which Nobel laureate in economics is associated with the University of Chicago?
7. What is the primary research focus area of the University of Chicago?
8. In which state is the University of Chicago located?
9. What is the name of the university's mascot?
10. Which organization is the University of Chicago a member of?

Now, checking if these questions are varied and cover different aspects. Location (questions 1, 8), founding date, schools, nickname, library, Nobel laureate, research focus, state, mascot, and membership in AAU. That seems good. Also, ensuring that each answer is directly from the context. For example, the main library is Regenstein Library, the mascot is Maroons, the state is Illinois, etc. I need to make sure that each answer is correct and directly supported by the context. Also, avoid repeating similar questions. Now, format each pair as CSV with semicolons. Let me write them out.
