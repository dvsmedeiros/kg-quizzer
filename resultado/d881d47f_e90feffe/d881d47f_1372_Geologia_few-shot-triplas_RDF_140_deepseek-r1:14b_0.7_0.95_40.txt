Okay, so I need to generate 10 question and answer pairs based on the examples provided. The questions are about geology, focusing on rocks and plate tectonics. Let me start by reviewing the example pairs to understand the pattern.

The examples include questions like "Uma rocha ígnea é uma rocha que cristaliza de quê?" with answers related to magma or lava. Another one is about how sedimentary rock can turn into metamorphic rock, and so on. The questions seem to target key concepts in geology, such as the types of rocks, processes that form them, and significant discoveries related to plate tectonics.

I should ensure each question has a clear and concise answer, sticking to the main points without extra details. I'll need to cover topics like rock types, their formation processes, changes between rock types due to heat and pressure, major geological discoveries, and components of the Earth's structure related to tectonic plates.

Let me list possible questions first:

1. What is the primary process involved in the formation of igneous rocks?
2. How do sedimentary rocks form?
3. What happens when metamorphic rocks are exposed to high heat and pressure?
4. Which scientist is credited with the continental drift theory?
5. What evidence supports the idea of seafloor spreading?
6. What is the name of the layer of Earth directly below the lithosphere?
7. What type of stress causes earthquakes along fault lines?
8. How do mid-ocean ridges form?
9. What are the two main types of plate boundaries?
10. Which theory explains the movement of tectonic plates?

Now, I'll formulate these into questions and answers following the example format.

Wait, let me check if these cover all necessary points as per the examples. The initial response had some specific terms like "derretimento" (melting), which relates to igneous rocks forming from magma or lava. Also, it included questions about plate tectonics discoveries and Earth's layers.

I think including a mix of rock types, their formation processes, and plate tectonics would be good. Let me adjust the list to ensure variety:

1. What are the three main types of rocks?
2. How do sedimentary rocks form from pre-existing materials?
3. Name the process by which igneous rocks form.
4. What changes a sedimentary rock into a metamorphic one?
5. What discovery was key in understanding seafloor spreading?
6. Which part of the Earth is directly under the crust?
7. What causes the movement of tectonic plates?
8. What happens at divergent plate boundaries?
9. How do mountain ranges like the Andes form?
10. What evidence showed that continents were once connected?

Now, I'll translate these into Portuguese and format them as per the examples, making sure each answer is a short phrase or term.
