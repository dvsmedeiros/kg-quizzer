Okay, I need to generate 10 CSV pairs of questions and answers based on the provided context and facts about Warsaw. Let me start by understanding the context and the facts given.

First, the context mentions that Warsaw is the capital and largest city of Poland, located on the Vistula River. It has a population of around 1.7 million, and it's known for its historical significance, including the Warsaw Uprising and its reconstruction after WWII. It's also a hub for education, industry, and cultural institutions like the National Theatre and the Opera. The city has been designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Additionally, it's home to Frontex, the European Union's border agency, and has various rankings in habitability and business friendliness.

Now, looking at the facts, there are a lot of names of people who were born or died in Warsaw, locations of institutions, sports events, and some weather data. The examples provided in the query include questions about the largest city in Poland, the river, distance from the Baltic Sea, population, and rankings. I need to create similar questions but ensure they are varied and cover different aspects of the content.

I should avoid repeating the same type of questions. For example, if I already asked about the largest city, I shouldn't ask another question about population. Instead, I can focus on different aspects like historical events, landmarks, sports, institutions, and weather data.

Let me brainstorm possible questions. 

1. Which river flows through Warsaw? (Answer: Vístula)
2. What is the name of the UNESCO World Heritage Site in Warsaw? (Answer: Centre Historique de Varsóvia)
3. Which organization is headquartered in Warsaw? (Answer: Frontex)
4. What is the population of Warsaw according to the 2012 estimate? (Answer: 1,716,855)
5. What is the nickname of Warsaw due to its history and reconstruction? (Answer: Phoenix City)
6. What is the name of the bridge in Warsaw associated with Sigismund Augustus? (Answer: Sigismund Augustus Bridge)
7. Which famous landmark is located in Warsaw? (Answer: Coluna de Sigismundo)
8. What is the name of the football stadium in Warsaw? (Answer: Stadion Dziesięciolecia)
9. What is the name of the Polish university located in Warsaw? (Answer: Universidade de Varsóvia)
10. What is the highest recorded temperature in Warsaw during June? (Answer: 36.2°C)

Wait, I need to check if these answers are directly from the context or facts. For example, the Centre Historique de Varsóvia is mentioned in the context as a UNESCO site. The Stadion Dziesięciolecia is listed in the facts. The Universidade de Varsóvia is mentioned. The temperature data is in the facts. The Sigismund Augustus Bridge is mentioned. The nickname Phoenix City is from the context. Frontex is mentioned as the agency in Warsaw. The Coluna de Sigismundo is a landmark. The football stadium is in the facts. The population number is from the context. 

I need to make sure each question is unique and covers different aspects. Let me verify if all answers are correctly inferred from the provided content. Also, ensure that the questions are phrased clearly and the answers are specific. Avoid any repetition. Let me compile these into the CSV format as specified.
