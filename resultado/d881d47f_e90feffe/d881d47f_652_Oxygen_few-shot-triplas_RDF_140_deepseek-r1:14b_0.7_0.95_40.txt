Okay, so I've been given this task to generate 10 question and answer pairs based on the context provided about oxygen. The output needs to be in CSV format with each line containing a question and its correct answer separated by a semicolon.

First, I need to carefully read through the entire context provided. It's pretty detailed, covering the chemical properties of oxygen, its discovery, and various applications. There are also some RDF facts which link different DBpedia resources to oxygen, but those might not be directly relevant for the questions unless they provide specific data points.

I should make sure that each question is unique and covers different aspects of the content. The examples provided give a good template: number atomic, abundance, atmospheric composition, chemical properties, etc.

Let me list out potential areas to cover in the questions:
1. Basic facts (atomic number, symbol)
2. Abundance in universe and Earth
3. Atmospheric composition
4. Physical states
5. Reactivity and compounds
6. Discovery history
7. Applications
8. Comparison with other elements (like helium)

I need to ensure that each question is clear and the answers are concise and correct based on the context.

Looking back at the examples, I notice some repetition and areas where questions could be more varied. For instance, there's a focus on atomic number, abundance, and atmospheric composition in several examples. To add variety, I can include questions about physical properties, chemical behavior, and historical facts.

I should also make sure that each question is distinct and doesn't overlap too much with others. Additionally, the answers should be specific—like numbers or exact terms from the context.

Now, let's draft 10 unique questions covering these areas:

1. What is the atomic number of oxygen?
2. In what state does oxygen commonly exist at room temperature?
3. What are oxygen and ozone examples of in terms of allotropes?
4. Which group in the periodic table belongs to oxygen?
5. What is another name for the chalcogen group, which includes oxygen?
6. Besides supporting life, what other crucial role does oxygen play on Earth?
7. Who was one of the discoverers of oxygen?
8. Approximately, how much of the Earth's crust is composed of oxygen by mass?
9. What percentage of dry air is oxygen?
10. What are the two main forms in which elemental oxygen exists?

I think these cover a broad range of topics related to oxygen and should provide a comprehensive set of questions without overlapping too much.

Here is the CSV output with 10 unique question-answer pairs based on the context about oxygen:

```
O que é o número atômico do oxigênio?;8.
