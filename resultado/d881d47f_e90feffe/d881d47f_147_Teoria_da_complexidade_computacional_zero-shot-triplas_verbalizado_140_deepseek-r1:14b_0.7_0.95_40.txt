Okay, so I need to generate 10 pairs of questions and answers based on the provided context about computational complexity theory. Let me start by reviewing the facts given.

First, I see that Nikolai Sergeevich Bakhvalov is known for computational complexity theory. That could be a question asking who is associated with it, and the answer would be his name.

Next, there's mention of hiperônimo Branch as a hypernym for the field. So a question about what Computational Complexity Theory belongs to could use that.

The type PsychologicalFeature100023100 is listed, so I can create a question asking what type it is, with that as the answer.

There's a title called Computational complexity classes, which seems important enough to be a key aspect of the field. So a question about its main focus could point to that.

Looking at the models used on Wikipedia pages, like Template:Computer science, I can form a question about which template is used for the page.

Jelani Nelson and others are listed as people who actua na disciplina, so several questions can be made about specific individuals involved, each with their respective names as answers.

There are multiple models mentioned such as Template:Quote, Template:Garey-Johnson, etc. Each of these could form a question about which template is used for the page.

Imagens representativas like Complexity subsets pspace.svg and Sorting quicksort anim.gif are noted, so questions can ask about specific images associated with the theory.

I also notice that several people are listed multiple times, but I need to make sure each question is unique. So I'll focus on different aspects rather than repeating the same person in similar questions.

Lastly, there's mention of various categories and types like WikicatAlgorithms and Abstraction100002137. These can be used to create questions about classifications or types related to the theory.

Now, organizing all these points into distinct questions ensuring each is unique and covers different aspects: people, models, templates, images, titles, categories, etc.
