Alright, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs based on the given data about Jacksonville, Florida. Let me start by understanding what information is available in the provided RDF data.

First, I see that Jacksonville is a city in Duval County, Florida. It has some geographical and demographic details like area land, temperature records, population rank, etc. There are also mentions of various entities related to the city—people, places, institutions, events, and more. The examples given in the prompt show questions about population, demographics, geography, history, and notable figures.

I should focus on extracting key facts from the data that can form the basis of questions. For instance, Jacksonville's population rank being 12th in the U.S., its area land, temperature records like record high and low temperatures in different months, and historical aspects such as Fort Caroline and the Timucua people.

I need to ensure each question is clear and directly relates to a specific piece of information from the data. The answers should be concise, using only the exact data points provided without making assumptions beyond what's given.

Let me start drafting some questions:

1. What is the population rank of Jacksonville in the United States? - 12th

Next, I can ask about the area land to get a sense of the city's size.

2. What is the land area of Jacksonville in square kilometers? - The data shows "areaLand" as "1935498000.0", which I think needs to be converted into square kilometers. Wait, that number seems too large. Maybe it's in square meters or another unit. Since 1935498000.0 is likely in square meters (as 1 km² = 1,000,000 m²), so dividing by 1,000,000 gives approximately 1935.5 km².

But the example response uses commas for numbers like "1.345.596", which suggests using a dot as a thousand separator in Portuguese. So maybe I should present it as 1.935,5 km².

Wait, no, perhaps the data is already in square kilometers? Let me check: The value is 1935498000.0, but without context on units. Given that Jacksonville's area is known to be around 2,769 square kilometers (from general knowledge), this number doesn't align. So perhaps there's a mistake in the data or misunderstanding of units. Since I can't verify, I'll proceed with what's given.

3. What was the population of Jacksonville in 2010? - The example answer is "1.345.596", so that's straightforward.

4. What is the record high temperature in January for Jacksonville? - 85°F

5. What is the record low temperature in February? - 10°F

For historical aspects:

6. Which river flows through Jacksonville? - St. Johns River (from example)

7. Name a significant historical figure associated with Jacksonville's naming. - Andrew Jackson

8. What was the name of the French colony established in 1564? - Fort Caroline

9. Who were the original inhabitants of the area now known as Jacksonville before the French arrived? - The Timucua people

Now, I need two more questions. Perhaps about geographical features or other historical events.

Looking back at the data, there's mention of the Timucuan Ecological and Historic Preserve, so maybe:

10. What is the name of the ecological preserve in Jacksonville? - Timucuan Ecological and Historic Preserve

Alternatively, considering the examples provided, perhaps a question about the consolidation year with Duval County.

Wait, the example already includes "Em que ano a consolidação fez com que Jacksonville se tornasse parte do Condado de Duval?" which translates to "In what year did the consolidation make Jacksonville part of Duval County?" The answer is 1968. So that's another question.

So adjusting, I'll include that as one of the questions.
