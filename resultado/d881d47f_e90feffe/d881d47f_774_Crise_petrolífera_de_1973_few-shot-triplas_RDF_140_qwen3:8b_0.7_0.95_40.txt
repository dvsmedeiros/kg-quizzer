Okay, I need to generate 10 CSV pairs of questions and answers based on the provided context about the 1973 oil crisis. Let me start by understanding the context thoroughly.

The crisis began in October 1973 when OPEC members imposed an embargo on nations supporting Israel during the Yom Kippur War. The initial targets were Canada, Japan, Netherlands, UK, and the US, later expanding to Portugal, Rhodesia, and South Africa. The oil price rose from $3 to around $12 by March 1974, with higher prices in the US. It's called the "first oil shock," followed by the 1979 crisis as the "second."

Now, I need to create varied questions covering different aspects. Let me list possible angles: start date, price changes, countries involved, reasons for the embargo, effects, terms used, duration, expansion of the embargo, US response, and the second crisis.

First question: When did the crisis start? Answer: October 1973.

Second: What was the oil price in March 1974? Answer: Around $12.

Third: Which countries were initially targeted? Answer: Canada, Japan, Netherlands, UK, and the US.

Fourth: Why did OPEC impose the embargo? Answer: Because of support for Israel during the Yom Kippur War.

Fifth: What was another term for this crisis? Answer: First oil shock.

Sixth: Which countries joined the embargo later? Answer: Portugal, Rhodesia, and South Africa.

Seventh: How did the US respond? Answer: Nixon negotiated with Israel to withdraw from Sinai and Golan.

Eighth: When did Kissinger negotiate the Sinai withdrawal? Answer: January 18, 1974.

Ninth: When did OPEC lift the embargo? Answer: March 1974.

Tenth: When was the second oil crisis? Answer: 1979.

Wait, the user provided examples that include some of these, like the start date and the second crisis. Need to ensure not to repeat similar questions. Let me check the examples again to avoid duplication. The examples include questions about the start date, price in March 1974, second crisis, embargo proclamers, reasons for separation, Nixon's negotiation, Kissinger's date, embargo lift, and US withdrawal from Bretton Woods. So I need to avoid those. Let me adjust.

Maybe focus on the embargo expansion, the terms used, the impact on prices, the duration, the countries involved, the reason for the embargo, the US response, the duration, and the second crisis. Let me make sure each question is unique and covers different aspects. Let me structure the CSV accordingly.
