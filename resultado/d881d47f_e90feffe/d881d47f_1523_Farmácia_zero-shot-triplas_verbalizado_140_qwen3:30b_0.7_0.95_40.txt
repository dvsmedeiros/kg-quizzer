Okay, I need to generate 10 pairs of questions and answers in Portuguese based on the given context and facts. Let me start by understanding the context. The context defines "Farmácia" as the science practiced by pharmacists, studying drugs and their interaction with users. The facts list various entities related to Pharmacy, like organizations, companies, models, images, etc.

First, I should identify different aspects from the context and facts. The questions need to be varied, covering different elements like definitions, examples, models, images, industries, etc. I need to make sure each question is unique and not repetitive.

Looking at the facts, there are mentions of organizations like Australian Pharmaceutical Formulary, American Society of Consultant Pharmacists, and companies like Big B Drugs, Apollo Hospitals, etc. There are also models like Template:Pharmacy, images like 42-aspetti di vita quotidiana, medicine, Taccuino Sanitatis.jpg, and others.

I need to form questions that ask about these elements. For example, "O que é Farmácia?" (What is Pharmacy?) and the answer would be the definition from the context. Then, "Quais são exemplos de organizações que atuam na área de Farmácia?" (What are examples of organizations working in Pharmacy?) with answers like Australian Pharmaceutical Formulary, American Society of Consultant Pharmacists, etc.

I should check that each answer is directly from the facts provided. Also, ensure that each question is distinct. Let me list possible questions:

1. Definition of Pharmacy.
2. Examples of organizations in Pharmacy.
3. Models used by Pharmacy.
4. Images associated with Pharmacy.
5. Industries related to Pharmacy.
6. Professional roles in Pharmacy.
7. Disciplines or areas of Pharmacy.
8. Specific companies or pharmacies.
9. Categories or topics related to Pharmacy.
10. Types of activities or sectors Pharmacy is involved in.

Now, I need to pick 10 unique ones. Let me make sure not to repeat similar questions. For example, one about organizations, another about models, another about images, etc. Each answer should be a direct match from the facts.

I need to structure each pair as "pergunta;resposta" in CSV format. Let me verify each answer is correct based on the facts provided. For example, "Pharmacy usa modelo de página wiki Template:Pharmacy" becomes a question about models used. Similarly, "Pharmacy possui imagem representativa 42-aspetti..." becomes a question about images.

I'll go through each fact and pick different aspects to form the questions. Make sure there are 10 unique pairs without repetition. Avoid using the same fact twice. Check for variety in the types of questions.
