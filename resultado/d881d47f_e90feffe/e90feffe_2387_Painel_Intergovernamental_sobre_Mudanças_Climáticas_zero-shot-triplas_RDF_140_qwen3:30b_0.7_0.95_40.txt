Okay, I need to generate 10 question and answer pairs in Portuguese based on the given context and facts. Let me start by carefully reading the context provided.

The context is about the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change). It mentions that it was created in 1988 by the UN Environment Programme and the World Meteorological Organization. Its main goal is to summarize and disseminate the latest knowledge on climate change, focusing on global warming, causes, effects, and solutions. It doesn't do original research but synthesizes existing work. They've produced five major reports since 1990, and they won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2007.

Now, the facts are in a structured format with various properties. For example, some people are linked to the IPCC, like Bert Bolin, Filippo Giorgi, etc. Also, the IPCC's headquarters are in Geneva, Switzerland. The organization has different classifications, like being a panel, an agency, etc. There are also some templates and categories associated with it.

The user wants 10 pairs of questions and answers, each in Portuguese, separated by semicolons. The questions should be varied, covering different aspects of the content. The answers must be directly from the context or inferable from it. No repetition of similar questions.

Let me brainstorm possible questions:

1. What is the full name of IPCC in Portuguese? (Answer: Painel Intergovernamental sobre Mudanças Climáticas)
2. When was IPCC established? (Answer: 1988)
3. Which organizations founded IPCC? (Answer: PNUMA and OMM)
4. What is the main objective of IPCC? (Answer: Synthesize and disseminate knowledge on climate change)
5. How many major reports has IPCC produced? (Answer: Five)
6. When was the first report published? (Answer: 1990)
7. Where is IPCC's headquarters? (Answer: Geneva, Switzerland)
8. Who is the current chair? (Answer: Hoesung Lee)
9. What prize did IPCC receive in 2007? (Answer: Nobel Peace Prize)
10. What is the type of IPCC according to the data? (Answer: Panel)

Wait, need to check the facts for accuracy. The context says the first report was in 1990 and the last in 2014. The facts mention that the IPCC's headquarters are in Geneva, Switzerland. The leaderName is Hoesung Lee, and the leaderTitle is "Chair". The type is "Panel".

Also, the context mentions that it's a scientific-political organization, not producing original research. So maybe another question about that.

Another possible question: What does IPCC not do? (Answer: Produce original research)

But need to ensure that the answers are directly from the context. Let me check each answer against the provided context and facts.

Yes, the answers should be based on the given information. Let me structure the 10 pairs now, making sure they are varied and cover different aspects.
