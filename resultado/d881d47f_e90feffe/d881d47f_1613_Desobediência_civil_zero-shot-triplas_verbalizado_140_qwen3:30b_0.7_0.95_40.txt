Okay, the user wants me to generate 10 pairs of questions and answers in CSV format based on the provided context and facts about civil disobedience. Let me start by understanding the requirements.

First, the context mentions that civil disobedience is a form of peaceful protest against unjust laws or oppressive governments. It was formulated by Henry David Thoreau and used by Gandhi and Martin Luther King. The facts list various events and models related to civil disobedience. 

I need to create 10 unique questions, each with a correct answer derived from the context or facts. The questions should cover different aspects. Let me scan through the facts to find key points.

Looking at the facts, there's mention of specific events like the 2021 End SARS protest, the Assam Movement, and the Kyrgyz Revolution of 2020. Also, there are references to models used on Wikipedia, people associated like Tony Milligan and Veliyankode Umar Khasi, and concepts like nonviolence and direct action.

Possible questions could be about the origin (Thoreau), notable figures (Gandhi, MLK), definitions, examples of events, models used, categories, and specific facts from the data. I need to ensure each question is distinct and not repetitive.

For example, one question could be about the originator, another about a key event, another about a related category, and so on. I should check that each answer is directly from the context or facts provided. Avoid making up information not present.

Also, need to make sure the CSV format is correct, with semicolons and no extra text. Let me draft each pair, verify against the context, and ensure they are varied. Let me count to make sure there are exactly 10.
