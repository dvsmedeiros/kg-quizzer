Okay, I'm trying to figure out how to generate these 10 pairs of questions and answers based on the context provided about Southern California. Let me start by understanding the task.

The user has given a detailed context about Southern California, including various facts about its geography, population, organizations, and more. They want exactly 10 CSV-formatted lines with each line containing a question and its correct answer separated by a semicolon. The questions should be varied, covering different aspects of the content without repeating similar ones.

First, I'll review the context to identify key points that can form the basis of these questions. From the facts provided, there's information about the region's boundaries, population, transportation (railroads), cultural elements like music and TV stations, sports teams, and notable people born there.

I need to make sure each question is clear and relates directly to one fact. For example, a question about the population in 2019 would have the answer "23,8 milhões de pessoas." Another could be about the largest city or significant transportation lines like I-8 or I-10.

It's important to vary the topics—maybe include questions about geography, economy, culture, and demographics. I should avoid repetition and ensure each question is unique in its focus.

Let me list out potential questions:

1. What was Southern California's population in 2019?
2. Which railroad operates in Southern California?
3. Which radio station serves the region?
4. Where did actor Nolan Bushnell grow up?
5. Name a major highway in Southern California.
6. What is Southern California's largest city?
7. Which TV network covers the area?
8. Which county is part of Southern California?
9. Where is the band The Joneses from?
10. Which avocado organization is based there?

Now, I'll make sure each question has a clear answer from the provided context and that they cover different aspects without overlapping too much.
