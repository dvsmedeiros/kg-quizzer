Okay, I need to generate 10 pairs of questions and answers based on the given context about civil disobedience. Let me first understand what civil disobedience is from the provided information.

Civil disobedience is a form of protest where people oppose government actions perceived as unjust or oppressive without using violent force. It was initially discussed by Henry David Thoreau and has been used in various countries, like India for independence, the US for racial segregation, etc.

The context also lists several instances across different regions—such as Russia, Montenegro, Iran, and more. Each of these had their own civil disobedience movements leading to protests.

Now, I need to create 10 questions that cover a range of aspects related to civil disobedience based on the provided facts. The answers should be direct and unique, explaining what happened in each case or describing key points about the movement.

Let me think about different angles: historical examples, how it's used as protest, its application in various countries, notable individuals involved, etc.

1. What led to the 2017 protests in Montenegro? - This relates to the context where the Montenegrin crisis was addressed through civil disobedience.
2. How does civil disobedience differ from nonviolent resistance? - While both aim for change without violence, their methods and outcomes can vary based on the situation.
3. In which year did Gandhi successfully use civil disobedience in India? - Gandhi used it effectively to get laws passed against British rule.
4. Which historical figure formalized the concept of civil disobedience? - Thoreau wrote "On Civil Disobedience," formalizing this idea.
5. How was the2018–2019 Iranian protests a form of civil disobedience? - They opposed government actions like mandatory hijab, using nonviolent methods.
6. What example is given for the global application of civil disobedience in the context provided? - The 2021 End SARS protest in Nigeria is an example where it was used to oppose government reforms.
7. Which organization is associated with a specific form of civil disobedience? - The Committee of 100 used nonviolent protests against British laws.
8. What caused George Floyd's protests to escalate globally? - Police violence against African Americans led the movement to use civil disobedience worldwide.
9. Where was Henry David Thoreau's original example of civil disobedience set? - It happened in Concord, Massachusetts where he refused to pay taxes opposing the war.
10. Which historical event used a form of civil disobedience to achieve independence? - The 1998 Russian miners strike via methods like civil disobedience.

I think these cover various points from definitions, examples, applications across different regions, key figures, and outcomes. I'll structure them as questions with clear single answers based on the context provided.
