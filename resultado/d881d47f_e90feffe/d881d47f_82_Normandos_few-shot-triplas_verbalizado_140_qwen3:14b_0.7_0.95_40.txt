Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the provided context and facts. The context is about the Normans, their origins, historical significance, and related details. The facts include things like their religion, languages, related places, battles, and even some Wikipedia templates they use.

First, I need to make sure each question is unique and covers different aspects. Let's start with the basics. The first fact mentions that Normans are from the North of France, so a question about their origin could be good. Then, their relation to Vikings, since the context says their aristocracy descended from Vikings. That's another point.

Next, their religious beliefs. The facts mention Norse paganism and Christianity. Maybe a question on which religion they followed. Then, the language they spoke, which is Old Norse. Also, some battles they were involved in, like the Battle of Olivento or the Siege of Mahdia. The user might want questions about these events.

There's also mention of specific places like St. Mary's Church in Mortehoe and St. Bride's Church, which follow the Norman architectural style. That could be a question on architecture. Additionally, the Normans' role in the Crusades, as mentioned in the context. Also, their influence in Sicily and southern Italy.

I need to avoid repeating similar questions. For example, if I ask about a battle, another could be about a place they occupied, like Kells Castle. Also, the fact that they used certain Wikipedia templates, but maybe that's too technical. The user probably wants more historical and cultural aspects.

Let me list out possible questions:

1. De onde os normandos descendiam principalmente? (Origin from Vikings)
2. Qual era a religião principal dos normandos antes da conversão ao cristianismo? (Norse paganism)
3. Qual é a origem do termo "normando"? (Northmen)
4. Em quais regiões os normandos tiveram influência significativa? (Normandy, England, Sicily, Southern Italy)
5. Que batalha teve como combatentes os normandos? (Battle of Olivento)
6. Qual é o estilo arquitetônico associado aos normandos? (Norman style)
7. Quais são alguns exemplos de catedrais ou castelos construídos pelos normandos? (St Mary's Church, Mortehoe)
8. Quem era um conhecido personagem normando? (Richard of Salerno)
9. Qual era o idioma falado pelos normandos? (Old Norse)
10. Qual evento histórico destacou a participação dos normandos nas Cruzadas? (Crusades)

Now, checking the facts to ensure accuracy. The context says they descend from Vikings, so question 1 is covered. The religion before Christianity was Norse paganism, so question 2. The term "Norman" comes from Northmen, question 3. Their influence in Normandy, England, Sicily, etc., question 4. Battle of Olivento is listed, question 5. Architecture style is Norman, question 6. St Mary's Church is mentioned, question 7. Richard of Salerno is a person, question 8. Old Norse is their language, question 9. Crusades as an event, question 10.

That makes 10 questions. Now, I need to format them correctly in CSV with semicolons. Let me make sure each answer is directly from the context or facts provided. For example, the answer to the origin is "viquingues da Escandinávia" as per the context. The religious answer is Norse paganism, and so on. Also, checking for any repetition or similar questions. Looks good. Now, translating the answers into Portuguese as required.
