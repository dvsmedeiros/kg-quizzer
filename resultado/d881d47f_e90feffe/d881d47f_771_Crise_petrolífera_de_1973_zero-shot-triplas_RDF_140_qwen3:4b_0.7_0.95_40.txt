Okay, the user wants me to generate 10 pairs of questions and answers in CSV format based on the provided context about the 1973 oil crisis. Let me start by carefully reading the context to ensure I understand all the key points.

First, the crisis started in October 1973 when OPEP members imposed an embargo on countries supporting Israel during the Yom Kippur War. The countries affected initially were Canada, Japan, the Netherlands, the UK, and the US, later expanding to Portugal, Rhodesia, and South Africa. The oil price increased from $3 to $12 per barrel, with even higher prices in the US. This caused a "oil shock" with various global economic and political effects. It's known as the first oil shock, followed by the 1979 crisis as the second.

Now, I need to create 10 different questions that cover various aspects of this information. Let me brainstorm possible questions:

1. When did the 1973 oil crisis begin?
2. Which organization imposed the oil embargo?
3. What was the initial target of the embargo?
4. Which countries were initially affected by the embargo?
5. What was the price of oil before and after the embargo?
6. What was the name given to the 1973 crisis?
7. What were the long-term effects of the crisis?
8. What was the price of oil in the US during the crisis?
9. Which countries joined the embargo later?
10. What was the impact of the embargo on the global economy?

I need to make sure each question is unique and covers different aspects. Let me check if these are all covered in the context. The first question is about the start date, which is clearly stated. The second is about the organization, which is OPEP. The third is the reason for the embargo, which is supporting Israel. The fourth lists the initial countries. The fifth is the price change. The sixth is the name of the crisis. The seventh could be about the effects, but the context mentions both short and long-term effects. The eighth is the US price. The ninth is the countries that joined later. The tenth is the impact on the global economy.

Wait, the user specified that the answers must be explicitly or inferable from the context. Let me verify each answer against the provided text.

1. October 1973 – correct.
2. OPEP – correct.
3. Countries supporting Israel – correct.
4. Canada, Japan, Netherlands, UK, US – correct.
5. $3 to $12 – correct.
6. First oil shock – correct.
7. The context mentions "many effects, short or long-term" but the answer should be specific. The user's context says "causou uma crise, ou 'choque' de petróleo, com muitos efeitos, de curto ou longo prazo, na política e economia global." So maybe the answer should be that it caused a crisis with both short and long-term effects. But the question might need to be phrased to get that answer.
8. US prices were even higher – correct.
9. Portugal, Rhodesia, South Africa – correct.
10. The impact was on the global economy and politics – correct.

I need to make sure each answer is accurate. Also, check for any possible repetition. The questions seem to cover different aspects. Now, I need to format them as CSV with each pair separated by a semicolon. Let me structure them properly without any markdown, just the CSV.
