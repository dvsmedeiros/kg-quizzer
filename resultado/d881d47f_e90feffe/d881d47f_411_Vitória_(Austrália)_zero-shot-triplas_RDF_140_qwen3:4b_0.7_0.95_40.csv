pergunta;resposta
Alternatively, maybe the depictions are four separate answers. Let me structure them properly. Also, ensure that the questions are in Portuguese. Wait, the user didn't specify the language, but the initial data is in Portuguese. Wait, the instruction says "Gere agora os 10 pares pergunta;resposta conforme as instruções e regras acima." So the user is asking for the answers in Portuguese, but the initial data is in Portuguese. So the questions and answers need to be in Portuguese.
But I need to check if these are accurate. The depictions are four images, so maybe each can be a question. However, the user might not want to list each image separately. Alternatively, the answer could be the list of images. But the user might prefer each image as a separate answer. However, the instruction says "10 pares pergunta;resposta", so maybe 10 distinct questions, each with a unique answer.
