Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the given context and facts. The context is about British Satellite Broadcasting (BSB), its incorporation into BSkyB, and some related data from the RDF triples.

First, I need to extract key information from the context and the facts. The main points are:

- BSB was incorporated in November 1990 to form BSkyB.
- BSB started transmitting on March 25, 1990.
- BSB was a company based in London, UK.
- It merged with Sky Television to form BSkyB.
- Some channels and media related to BSB are listed in the RDF data (like Galaxy, Now, The Movie Channel, etc.).
- BSB was established in 1986, founded on December 11, 1986.
- It was based in Marco Polo House, London, England.
- The successor company is Sky UK.
- BSB is categorized under various topics like 1980s and 1990s UK television, mergers in 1990, etc.

Now, I need to create varied questions covering different aspects. Let's brainstorm possible questions:

1. When was BSB incorporated to form BSkyB? (Answer: November 1990)
2. When did BSB start transmitting? (March 25, 1990)
3. Where was BSB based? (London, UK)
4. What was the result of BSB merging with Sky Television? (BSkyB)
5. Which company is the successor of BSB? (Sky UK)
6. What year was BSB established? (1986)
7. What was the founding date of BSB? (December 11, 1986)
8. Which building was BSB's location? (Marco Polo House)
9. What category does BSB belong to? (Defunct mass media companies of the UK)
10. Which channels did BSB own? (Galaxy, Now, The Movie Channel, etc.)

Wait, need to make sure answers are from the provided data. Let me check the facts again.

The RDF mentions several channels owned by BSB: Galaxy, Now, The Movie Channel, The Power Station, The Computer Channel, etc. So a question about channels owned by BSB would be valid.

Also, the successor is Sky UK, and the merging happened in 1990. The founding date is 1986, and the location includes Marco Polo House in London.

Need to ensure each question is unique and covers different aspects. Let's structure them properly and ensure the answers are accurate based on the context and facts provided.
