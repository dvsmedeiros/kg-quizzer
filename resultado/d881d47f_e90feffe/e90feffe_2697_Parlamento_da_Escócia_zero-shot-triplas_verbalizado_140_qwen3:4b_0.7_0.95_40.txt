Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the provided context and facts about the Scottish Parliament. First, I need to make sure I understand the requirements.

The user specified that each question must be unique and cover different aspects of the content. They also mentioned that answers should be directly from the given facts. I need to go through the facts and identify key points that can be turned into questions.

Looking at the facts, there are several important details: the Scottish Parliament is unicameral with 129 members, located in Holyrood, Edinburgh, established in 1999, has a leader (First Minister), a Presiding Officer, and various committees. Also, the last election was in May 2016, and there are different constituencies and political parties involved.

I need to create questions that test knowledge of these points. For example, asking about the location, the number of members, the type of legislature, the leader's role, the election date, and the structure of constituencies. Also, the fact that the Scottish Parliament has a specific image and color code should be included.

I should avoid repeating similar questions. For instance, one question about the location, another about the number of members, another about the type of legislature, and so on. Also, the fact that the Scottish Parliament is unicameral and has a leader (First Minister) who answers to it. 

I need to check the facts again to ensure accuracy. The last election was in May 2016, but the user mentioned the next election is in May 2021. Wait, the facts say the last election was 2021-05-06, so maybe there's a mistake here. But the user's context mentions the last election in 2016, but the facts have the last election as 2021. Need to verify which one is correct. The context says "A última eleição geral para o parlamento escocês foi realizada em 5 de Maio de 2016." But the facts say "Scottish Parliament possui data da última eleição 2021-05-06". There's a contradiction here. However, the user's instruction says to base the answers strictly on the provided facts. So I should use the fact that the last election is May 2021.

Another point is the number of members, which is 129. The type of legislature is unicameral. The leader is the First Minister, who answers to the Scottish Parliament. The Presiding Officer is another leader. The image is "Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II at the opening of the Scottish Parliament.jpg". The color is #500791. The location is Edinburgh, Scotland. The first session was in May 1999. The Scottish Parliament has committees like Transport, Health, and Justice. Also, the Scottish Government is responsible for it.

Now, I need to structure 10 questions. Let me list possible questions:

1. Where is the Scottish Parliament located?
2. How many members does the Scottish Parliament have?
3. What is the type of legislature for the Scottish Parliament?
4. Who is the leader of the Scottish Parliament?
5. When was the last election for the Scottish Parliament?
6. What is the name of the image representing the Scottish Parliament?
7. What is the color code of the Scottish Parliament?
8. What is the location of the meeting place of the Scottish Parliament?
9. What is the name of the first session of the Scottish Parliament?
10. What is the role of the Scottish Government in relation to the Scottish Parliament?

I need to check if these are all covered in the facts. Yes, each of these points is present. Now, I'll format them into the CSV format as specified, ensuring each pair is separated by a semicolon and in Portuguese.
