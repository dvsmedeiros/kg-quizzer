Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to generate 10 CSV pairs of questions and answers based on the provided context about the Yuan Dynasty. First, I need to parse through the given content carefully.

The context mentions the Yuan Dynasty was founded by Kublai Khan, grandson of Genghis Khan, in 1271. The facts provided include various RDF triples, which I need to extract relevant information from. For example, there are entries about battles involving the Yuan Dynasty, notable people associated with it, and its establishment and dissolution years.

I should start by identifying key facts. The founding year is 1271, the founder is Kublai Khan, and the dynasty lasted until 1368. There are mentions of battles like the Battle of Bạch Đằng and the Mongol conquest of China. Also, there are references to the capital cities like Khanbaliq and Shangdu, and the currency used was banknotes.

Now, I need to form questions that cover different aspects. Let me make sure each question is unique and covers various points. For example, questions about the founder, establishment year, dissolution year, capital, currency, notable battles, associated languages, and related dynasties.

I need to check the examples provided to ensure the format is correct. The answers should be concise and directly from the data. Avoid any extra information. Let me list out possible questions:

1. Who founded the Yuan Dynasty?
2. When was the Yuan Dynasty established?
3. What was the capital of the Yuan Dynasty?
4. What currency was used during the Yuan Dynasty?
5. Which dynasty came before the Yuan Dynasty?
6. Which dynasty succeeded the Yuan Dynasty?
7. What was the name of the Mongol Empire's capital?
8. Which notable battle involved the Yuan Dynasty?
9. What languages were commonly used during the Yuan Dynasty?
10. Who was the grandfather of Kublai Khan?

Wait, the examples already have some of these, like the founder and establishment year. I need to ensure the questions are varied. Let me verify the data again. The dissolution year is 1368, so that's another question. Also, the dynasty's name in Chinese is Dà Yuán. There's mention of the Red Turban Rebellion as an event. 

I should make sure each answer is accurate based on the provided triples. For example, the capital is mentioned as Shangdu and Khanbaliq. The currency is banknotes. The dynasty before was the Song, and after was the Ming. The grandfather of Kublai Khan is Genghis Khan. 

I need to avoid repeating the same questions as the examples. Let me check the examples again. The user provided examples like "Who started the Yuan Dynasty?" and "When did Khan declare the dynasty?" So I need to ensure my questions are different but still cover the key points. Maybe include the dissolution year, the capital cities, the currency, and the Red Turban Rebellion. 

Also, there's a mention of the "Time Granting Calendar" as the calendar used, which could be another question. However, the user might prefer more straightforward questions. Let me focus on the most important facts. 

I think I have enough to form 10 unique questions. Now, I'll structure them into CSV format with the correct answers, ensuring they match the examples' style and accuracy.
