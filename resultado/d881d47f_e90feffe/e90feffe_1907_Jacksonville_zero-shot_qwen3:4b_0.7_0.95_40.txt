Okay, the user wants me to generate 10 objective questions and answers based on the context of "Jacksonville." Let me start by recalling what I know about Jacksonville. It's a city in Florida, USA. I need to make sure the questions cover different aspects of the city. Let me think of different areas: history, geography, culture, economy, notable landmarks, sports teams, population, nearby attractions, and maybe something about the weather or climate.

First, I should check if there are any specific facts about Jacksonville that I can use. The city was founded in 1822, so that's a good starting point for a question. Then, its location on the Atlantic coast is important. The Jacksonville Beach is a well-known area. The city is part of the Jacksonville Beach-Marche-Saint-Charles metropolitan area. The population is around 900,000, and it's known for the Jacksonville Sharks, a professional team. The city has a significant port and is a major tourist destination. There's also the Florida Museum of Science and History, and the Jacksonville Zoo and Gardens. The climate is subtropical, with hot summers and mild winters.

Now, I need to create 10 unique questions. Let me list possible topics:

1. Founding year
2. Location (coastal)
3. Nearby area (metropolitan area)
4. Population
5. Professional team
6. Notable landmark (beach)
7. Tourism attraction (zoo)
8. Climate
9. Port significance
10. Historical event (founder)

Wait, the user said to use the provided context. But the context given is just "Jacksonville," so I have to rely on general knowledge. However, the user might expect that the assistant uses the context given, which is just the city name. But since there's no additional context, I have to use general facts about Jacksonville. The user might have intended that the assistant uses the information they know about Jacksonville. Let me make sure each question is based on correct information. Let me verify each point:

- Founded in 1822: Correct.
- Located on the Atlantic coast: Correct.
- Part of the Jacksonville Beach-Marche-Saint-Charles metropolitan area: Yes.
- Population around 900,000: Yes.
- Jacksonville Sharks: Correct.
- Jacksonville Beach: Correct.
- Jacksonville Zoo and Gardens: Yes.
- Subtropical climate: Correct.
- Port of entry: Yes, it's a major port.
- Founded by John G. T. Jackson: Correct.

Now, I need to structure each question to be clear and have a single correct answer. Let me check for duplicates or similar questions. For example, the first question is about founding year, then location, then metropolitan area, population, team, beach, zoo, climate, port, and founder. That's 10 different aspects. I think that's good. Let me make sure the answers are accurate. For example, the founder is John G. T. Jackson. The population is around 900,000. The port is a major one. The climate is subtropical. The shark team is a professional team. The zoo and gardens are a tourist spot. The beach is a key area. The metropolitan area includes nearby cities. The founding year is 1822. The founder is John G. T. Jackson. That should cover all 10 points. Now, format them into the CSV as per the instructions, making sure each line is in the correct format with semicolons and no extra text.
