Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs based on the provided data about the Scottish Parliament. Let me start by looking through the data to find relevant information.

First, the data includes various properties like the establishment date, key acts, legislative powers, and historical context. The examples given mention the 1997 referendum, the Scotland Act 1998, and the role of the UK Parliament. 

I should check the "dcterms:subject" for categories like 1999 establishments, Government of Scotland, Parliaments by country, etc. The "ns2:lastElectionDate" is "2021-05-06" and "ns1:election" is "2021-05-13". There's also info about the number of members, location, and committees.

The user's examples have questions about when the current parliament was convened, the act that defined its powers, legislative competence, reserved powers, and historical context. I need to create similar questions but ensure they are distinct.

Possible questions:
1. When was the Scottish Parliament established? (From 1999 establishments)
2. What act granted it legislative powers? (Scotland Act 1998)
3. What areas can it legislate on? (Specific areas mentioned in the data)
4. Which body has reserved powers? (UK Parliament)
5. How many members does it have? (129)
6. Where is it located? (Edinburgh, Scotland)
7. What is the name of its building? (Scottish Parliament Building)
8. When was the last election? (2021-05-06)
9. Who is the current leader? (Alison Johnstone, Nicola Sturgeon)
10. What committees does it have? (List from the data)

I need to make sure the answers are accurate based on the data provided. For example, the "ns2:numberOfMembers" is "129", and the "ns1:meetingPlace" includes Edinburgh, Scotland. The "ns2:leader" is Alison Johnstone, but there's also mention of Nicola Sturgeon as the First Minister. The committees are listed as "Committee on The Scottish Government's Handling of Harassment Complaints against Former Ministers", "Europe and External Relations", etc.

I should avoid repeating the same structure as the examples. For instance, instead of asking about reserved powers, maybe ask about the number of members or the location. Also, check for any other unique details like the "commons" field being "yes" or the "wikiPageUsesTemplate" entries.

Another angle: the Scottish Parliament's role in specific areas like healthcare, education, or transport. However, the data doesn't specify those, so better stick to the given info. Maybe ask about the name of the building or the election dates.

I need to ensure 10 distinct questions. Let me list them:

1. When was the Scottish Parliament established?
2. What act granted it legislative powers?
3. What areas can the Scottish Parliament legislate on?
4. Which body has reserved powers for Scotland?
5. How many members does the Scottish Parliament have?
6. Where is the Scottish Parliament located?
7. What is the name of the building where the Scottish Parliament meets?
8. When was the last election held for the Scottish Parliament?
9. Who is the current Presiding Officer of the Scottish Parliament?
10. What are some of the committees of the Scottish Parliament?

Now, verify answers against the data:

1. 1999 (from dcterms:subject Category:1999_establishments_in_Scotland)
2. Scotland Act 1998 (from the examples, but need to check data. The examples mention "Lei da Escócia de 1998" which is the Scotland Act 1998)
3. The data says "competência legislativa" but the answer should be "em que ele pode fazer leis" (from the examples, but need to check. The data mentions "legislative powers" but the exact areas aren't listed, so maybe answer as per the examples)
4. UK Parliament (Parlamento do Reino Unido)
5. 129 members (ns2:numberOfMembers)
6. Edinburgh, Scotland (ns1:meetingPlace)
7. Scottish Parliament Building (ns1:meetingPlace)
8. Last election was 2021-05-06 (ns2:lastElectionDate)
9. Alison Johnstone (ns2:leader) and Nicola Sturgeon as First Minister (but the question is about Presiding Officer, which is a different role. The data mentions "Presiding Officer of the Scottish Parliament" as a leader type. The answer should be Alison Johnstone as per the data)
10. Committees listed in ns1:committees: "Committee on The Scottish Government's Handling of Harassment Complaints against Former Ministers," "Europe and External Relations", etc.

Now, check for any possible errors. The answer for question 9: The data has "ns2:leader" as Alison Johnstone, but the "leader1Type" is Presiding Officer. So the Presiding Officer is Alison Johnstone. The First Minister is Nicola Sturgeon, but that's a different role. So the answer for 9 is Alison Johnstone.

Okay, that should cover 10 questions. Now, format them as per the examples.
