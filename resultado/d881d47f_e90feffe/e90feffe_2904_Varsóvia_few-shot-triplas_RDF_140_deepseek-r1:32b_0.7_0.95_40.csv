Okay; so I need to generate 10 question and answer pairs based on the given data about Warsaw. Let me start by looking through all the triples provided. 
Looking at the attributes; there's a "marPrecipitationMm" of 29. That likely refers to average precipitation in March. So another question could ask for that value.
Warsaw has an official URL provided; which is about the city guide. So another question could ask for the official website.
The wordnet_type points to a synset related to monuments; so I can create a question about what category Warsaw falls into.
