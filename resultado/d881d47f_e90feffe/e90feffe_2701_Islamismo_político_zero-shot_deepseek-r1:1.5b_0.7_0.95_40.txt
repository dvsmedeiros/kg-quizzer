Okay, the user has asked me to generate a quiz based on "Islamismo_pol√≠tico" with exactly 10 pairs of questions and answers. They provided an example CSV output, which shows each question followed by a single correct answer separated by a semicolon.

First, I need to identify what topics are relevant within Islamism or political Islamism. Possible subjects include:

1. **Religious practices**: Things like Islamic holidays, prayer times, rituals.
2. **Political policies**: Tax laws, currency issues, defense strategies.
3. **Cultural aspects**: Importance of family, community, education in Islam.
4. **Ethical issues**: Moral dilemmas related to Islamic teachings or practices.

I should ensure each question has a unique answer that directly relates to the content provided. Since no specific facts are given, I can create hypothetical scenarios based on common themes.

For example:

- "What month marks the beginning of Ramadan?" (Answer: May 5th)
- "Which religious holiday is celebrated in China before Christmas?" (Answer: Xmas Day)

I need to avoid repeating questions, so each response must be unique. Let me structure 10 different questions with clear, straightforward answers.

Finally, I'll format them into a CSV table as per the user's instructions.
