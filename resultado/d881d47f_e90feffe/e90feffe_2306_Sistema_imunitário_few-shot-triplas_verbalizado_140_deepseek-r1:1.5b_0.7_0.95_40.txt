Okay, let me try to figure out how to generate these questions and answers based on the context provided. So, first, I need to understand what exactly is expected here. The user provided a detailed context about the immune system and some facts related to it. They also gave an example of how the output should look when 10 pairs are generated.

Alright, so for each pair, I have to create a question that relates to one of the topics and a corresponding answer that is correct. The questions should be varied but cover different aspects of the immune system as outlined in the context. Each answer needs to be clear and straightforward, directly addressing the question without any extra explanations.

Looking at the example provided:
- Question: O sistema imunológico protege os organismos contra o que?
  - Answer: doenças.
This makes sense because it's a direct follow-up question about what the immune system protects against. The answer is simple and clear, linking the question to something tangible like diseases.

Another example:
- Question: Qual é o sistema imunológico do cérebro conhecido como?
  - Answer: системы neuroimune.
This reinforces the concept by asking about a specific part of the immune system and its name. It ensures that the learner can distinguish between different systems within the immune response.

I should analyze each fact provided in the context to identify potential questions. The context mentions various imunological aspects, including types of antibodies, mechanisms of action, examples of pathogens, etc. I need to create 10 unique questions, so I'll have to make sure they cover a broad range without repetition.

Let's list out some ideas:

1. What is the main function of the immune system?
2. Which type of immunity involves cell-mediated responses?
3. Can you name an example of a pathogen that causes a common disease?
4. Explain the process by which antibodies recognize target proteins.
5. What are two types of immune cells, and what do they do?
6. Name an organism that requires a specific system for immune defense.
7. How does the adaptive immune response differ from the non-adaptive one?
8. Provide an example of a situation where adaptive immunity is demonstrated.
9. What is the difference between primary and secondary immune responses?
10. Can you give an example of an organism that has both innate and adaptive immune systems?

Now, I'll take each question and craft a clear answer that directly addresses it without adding unnecessary details.

For instance:

- Question: O sistema imunológico protege os organismos contra o que?
  - Answer: Doenças.
This is straightforward and relates to the main function of the immune system.

Another one:
- Question: Qual é o tipo principal da anti-s surface?
  - Answer: Anti-s surface e anti-s cell.
Again, it's a direct question with a clear answer, ensuring that each pair is accurate and relevant.

I should also ensure that the answers are in Portuguese as per the user's instructions. I'll need to double-check each answer to make sure there are no typos or grammatical errors.

Additionally, I need to verify that each pair follows the CSV format with a semicolon separating the question and answer lines. So, 10 pairs should result in two separate CSV files: one for the questions and another for the answers.

I also need to avoid any markdown formatting beyond what's specified. The final output should be clean and simple, without any additional text or explanations beyond the data itself.

Lastly, I'll make sure that all facts mentioned in the context are included as possible questions. For example, knowing about macrophages, T cells, dendritic cells, etc., will help create relevant and varied questions.
