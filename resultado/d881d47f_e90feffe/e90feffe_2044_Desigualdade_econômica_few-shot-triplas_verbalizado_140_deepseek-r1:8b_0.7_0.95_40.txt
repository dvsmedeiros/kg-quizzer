Okay, I need to generate 10 pairs of questions and correct answers in CSV format based on the given context about economic inequality. Let me start by understanding the key points from the context.

First, I'll review the context provided:

- Economic inequality refers to the distribution of wealth and income among people.
- It can be measured using tools like the Gini coefficient and the HDI adjusted for inequality.
- Globalization has reduced global inequality between nations but increased inequality within countries.
- There are various movements and studies related to economic inequality, such as Oxfam's reports and books by authors like Piketty.

Now, I'll look at the facts provided:

- Economic inequality is associated with many images and SVG charts, like the Kuznets curve.
- It's mentioned in contexts such as Occupy Atlanta, Capital in the Twenty-First Century, and The Rich and the Rest of Us.
- There are studies by Branko Milanović and Richard G. Wilkinson on this topic.

The examples given in the problem can help me frame my questions:

1. Questions about percentages of global wealth held by the top 1% or similar groups.
2. References to specific organizations like Oxfam and their findings.
3. Details about income distribution metrics, such as the Gini index.
4. Movements and protests related to economic inequality, such as Occupy Wall Street.

I'll start by creating questions that target these areas. Each question should be unique and cover different aspects of economic inequality.

1. How much wealth does the top 1% hold globally?
2. What did Oxfam report regarding wealth ownership?
3. What is the Gini coefficient used for?
4. Which countries have higher income inequality?
5. What movement focuses on economic inequality in cities like Los Angeles?

I need to ensure each question has a clear, correct answer based on the context. Let me check the facts again to confirm.

Looking back, I see mentions of Oxfam's reports and the Gini coefficient, as well as images related to wealth distribution. Also, movements like Occupy Wall Street are associated with economic inequality issues.

Now, structuring each question to extract information from these points:

1. How much of global wealth is held by the top 1%? Answer: Approximately 40%.
2. What percentage of people own the same wealth as the richest 85? Answer: About 3.5 billion.
3. What measure is used for income inequality? Answer: Gini coefficient.
4. Which cities have high income inequality? Answer: Los Angeles.
5. Which country has a higher Gini index than others? Answer: Brazil.
6. What study discusses the impact of inequality on growth? Answer: No direct mention, but context says it's not about growth rate, so maybe another angle.
7. Who did Oxfam's wealth report question? Answer: They found 1% own half.
8. How much wealth did "10 millionaires" have in 2008? Answer: Almost $41 trillion.
9. What is the income share of the top 1%? Answer: 40%.
10. What group has higher income in China compared to Europe and USA? Answer: Top earners.

I need to ensure each pair is unique and covers different aspects, avoiding repetition of similar questions. Let me list them out:

1. How much wealth does the top 1% hold globally?
2. What did Oxfam report about wealth ownership?
3. What is the Gini coefficient used for?
4. Which countries have higher income inequality? (Examples: USA vs China)
5. What movement focuses on economic inequality in cities like Los Angeles?
6. What study discusses the relationship between inequality and growth? (No direct info, maybe refer to impact on duration)
7. Who did Oxfam's wealth report target? (1% owning half)
8. What was the combined wealth of "10 millionaires" in 2008?
9. What percentage of income is earned by the top 1%? (40%)
10. Which group has higher income in China compared to others? (Top earners)

I think these cover a range of topics from measurements, studies, specific reports, and social movements related to economic inequality. Now, I'll structure them as per the required CSV format.
