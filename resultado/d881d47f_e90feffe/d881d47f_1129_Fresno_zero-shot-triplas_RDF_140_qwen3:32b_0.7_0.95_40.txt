Okay, let's tackle this. The user provided a bunch of RDF data about Fresno, California. They want me to generate 10 question-answer pairs based on the information in that data. First, I need to parse through all the triples and find relevant information that can form meaningful questions and answers.

Looking at the data, the main entity is "Fresno, California". It has various properties like area, population, location, and so on. Also, there are links to other entities related to Fresno, such as sports teams, events, and notable people. 

First, I should identify key facts. For example, the areaTotalKm is 300.43, which can be a question about the area. The populationMetro is 1,008,654, so a question about the metropolitan population. The populationDensityKm is 1823.43, which can be a question on population density. The location within Fresno County is another point. 

Then there are some events and places related to Fresno, like the UFC Fight Night and the Big Fresno Fair. Also, notable people born or died there, such as William Saroyan. Selland Arena is located there, which could be a venue question. The United States District Court for the Eastern District of California is another entity linked to Fresno.

I need to make sure each question is specific and the answer is directly from the data. Avoid questions that can't be answered with the given info. Also, check for any unique properties or interesting facts. For example, the areaLand and areaTotal in square meters, but maybe converting to square kilometers would be more understandable. The metropolitan population is a key demographic stat.

Let me list out possible questions:

1. What is the total area of Fresno in square kilometers?
2. What is the population density of Fresno per square kilometer?
3. What is the metropolitan population of Fresno?
4. Where is Fresno located in terms of administrative regions?
5. What is the demonym for people from Fresno?
6. In which district is the United States District Court for the Eastern District of California located?
7. What is the name of the annual event held in Fresno?
8. Which notable person died in Fresno, known for their literary works?
9. What is the name of the arena in Fresno?
10. What is the code or classification of Fresno according to the data?

Wait, checking the data again: the areaTotalKm is 300.43. The areaTotal is 300,430,000 square meters. The areaLand is 297,304,700 square meters. So converting square meters to square kilometers would be 297.3047 km² for land area and 300.43 total. But the user's data already has areaTotalKm as 300.43, so that's the total in km². So the total area is 300.43 km².

For the population density, the data has populationDensityKm as 1823.43 per km². That's a direct answer.

The metropolitan population is 1,008,654, which is a key figure.

Location: the administrative subdivision is "Fresno, California" under "Metropolitan Fresno" with subdivisionName. Also, it's in the Eastern District of California.

The demonym is "Fresnan".

Notable people: William Saroyan, who died there and was an author.

Events: The Big Fresno Fair is an annual event.

Venues: Selland Arena is located there.

Also, the UFC Fight Night event was held in Fresno.

Another point: the data mentions that Fresno is part of the San Joaquin Valley, so a question about the region could be relevant.

Let me structure these into 10 pairs, ensuring each is distinct and directly answerable from the data provided.
