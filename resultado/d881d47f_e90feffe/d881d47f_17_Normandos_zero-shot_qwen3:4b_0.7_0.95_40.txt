Okay, the user wants me to generate 10 objective questions and answers in CSV format based on the context provided, which is about the Normans. Let me start by recalling what I know about the Normans.

First, I need to make sure I cover different aspects of the Normans. That includes their origin, their migration, their influence on Europe, their role in the Norman Conquest, their culture, and their legacy. I should avoid repeating similar questions.

Let me brainstorm possible questions. For example, where did the Normans originate? Their migration route? How did they affect Europe? Who was their leader? What was the Norman Conquest? Their cultural contributions? Their relationship with the Church? Their impact on architecture? Their connection to the Danelaw? And maybe their legacy in modern times.

Now, I need to check if these questions are based on the context provided. The user mentioned the Normans, so I should stick to factual information. Each question must have a clear, correct answer that's either explicitly stated or inferable from the context. Since the context is just "Normandos," I have to rely on general knowledge about them. But the user might be referring to a specific text, so maybe I should assume that the context includes key points like their origin in Scandinavia, migration to France, William the Conqueror, the Norman Conquest of England, cultural influence, etc.

I need to make sure the questions are varied. Let me list them:

1. Origin of the Normans.
2. Migration route.
3. Influence on Europe.
4. Leader of the Normans.
5. Norman Conquest of England.
6. Cultural contributions.
7. Relationship with the Church.
8. Impact on architecture.
9. Connection to the Danelaw.
10. Legacy in modern times.

Wait, the user might have a specific context, but since it's only "Normandos," I have to use general knowledge. Let me verify each answer to ensure they are correct. For example, the Normans originated in Scandinavia, migrated to France, William the Conqueror led them, the Norman Conquest was in 1066, they influenced architecture, the Church was important, Danelaw was a region in England, and their legacy includes things like the Normans in the US.

I need to make sure each answer is accurate. Also, check for any possible duplicates or similar questions. For example, the Danelaw and the Norman Conquest are different, so they can be separate questions. 

Now, structure each question and answer in the CSV format as specified. Make sure the separator is semicolon, and each line has the question and answer. No extra text, just the CSV. Let me put them in order and check for 10 pairs.
