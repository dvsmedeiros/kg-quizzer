Okay, so I need to create a CSV file with exactly 10 pairs of questions and answers about Warsaw based on the provided context. The user has given me some examples, but now I have to do it myself without any prior information. Let me think through how to approach this.

First, I should understand what kind of information is available about Warsaw. From general knowledge, I can recall that Warsaw is the capital of Poland, located on the Vistula River, and has a rich history including periods under different rulers like the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, partitions by neighboring powers, and significant events during World War II.

I should structure my questions to cover various aspects: geography, history, culture, architecture, notable landmarks, population, and interesting facts. Each question must have one correct answer based on factual information about Warsaw.

Let me brainstorm possible questions:

1. **Geography:** What river flows through Warsaw? (Vistula River)
2. **History:** When was Warsaw liberated from Nazi occupation? (1945)
3. **Culture:** What is the currency used in Warsaw? (Polish Złoty)
4. **Landmarks:** What is the name of the iconic castle in Warsaw? (Warsaw Royal Castle)
5. **Population:** Approximately how many people live in Warsaw? (Around 1.7 million)
6. **Transportation:** Which metro system is known for its unique architecture? (Warsaw Metro)
7. **Events:** Name a famous market square in Warsaw. (Market Square, Rynek Starego Miasta)
8. **Museums:** What's the name of the museum located in the Royal Palace? (Palace of Culture and Science)
9. **Districts:** Which district is known for its Jewish history? (Warsaw Ghetto or District I)
10. **Languages:** What language is primarily spoken in Warsaw? (Polish)

Now, I'll structure each as a question followed by the correct answer, ensuring they are clear and directly related to facts about Warsaw.
