Okay, I need to help the user by generating a CSV file with exactly 10 pairs of questions and answers based on the provided context about Huguenots. Let me start by understanding the requirements.

First, the context explains that Huguenotes were French Protestants during the religious wars in France in the second half of the 16th century. They left France after persecutions under Louis XIV and the revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685. They were mainly Calvinists, part of the Reformed Church, while others in regions like Alsace, Moselle, and Montbéliard were Lutherans.

Looking at the facts provided, there are RDF triples linking Huguenots to other concepts like Catholic Church in France and Scotch-Irish Americans. There's also mention of places named after them, like Camisards and specific locations in New York and Staten Island.

I need to create 10 varied questions that cover different aspects: who they were, when key events happened, their religious affiliations, where they settled, etc. Each question should have a single correct answer from the context.

Let me think of possible questions:

1. Who were the Huguenots? (They were French Protestants)
2. When was the Edict of Nantes revoked? (October 18, 1685)
3. What religion did most Huguenots practice? (Calvinism)
4. Which regions had Lutheran Huguenots? (Alsace, Moselle, Montbéliard)
5. Why did many leave France after 1685? (Persecutions and revocation of Edict)
6. Which group faced separation from the Catholic Church in France? (Huguenots)
7. What was a key event causing their persecution? (Revocation of Nantes)
8. Where is there a Huguenot cemetery? Cork, Ireland
9. Name an ethnic group related to them: Scotch-Irish Americans
10. Which French religious groups were linked to them? Reformed Church

I should ensure each question and answer are clear and directly tied to the context. Also, avoid repeating similar questions.

Now, I'll structure these into CSV format with semicolons as separators.
