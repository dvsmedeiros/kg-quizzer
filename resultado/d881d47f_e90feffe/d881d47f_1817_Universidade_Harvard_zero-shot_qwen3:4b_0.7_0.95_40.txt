Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the context provided, which is "Universidade_Harvard". Let me start by understanding what the user is asking for.

First, the user wants exactly 10 pairs, each with a question and a correct answer. The questions should be varied and cover different aspects of the given context. The answers must be directly or inferentially derived from the context. Also, no repetitions of similar questions. The output should be in CSV format with semicolons as separators, in Portuguese.

But wait, the context provided is just "Universidade_Harvard". That's a bit vague. The user might be expecting information about Harvard University, but since the context is just the name, I need to make sure I don't make up information. However, the user might have intended that the context is the name of a university, and the questions should be about it. But without more specific information, I need to assume that the context is the name of the university, and the questions should be about general facts related to Harvard University.

So, the task is to create 10 questions and answers about Harvard University. Let me think of different aspects: history, location, notable alumni, academic programs, famous buildings, admissions, research, etc.

Let me start brainstorming possible questions:

1. Where is Harvard University located?
2. When was Harvard University founded?
3. What is the main campus of Harvard University known for?
4. Who is a famous alumnus of Harvard University?
5. What is the name of the central library at Harvard?
6. What is the name of the Harvard Medical School?
7. What is the name of the Harvard Business School?
8. What is the name of the Harvard Graduate School of Arts and Sciences?
9. What is the name of the Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences?
10. What is the name of the Harvard School of Public Health?

Wait, but the context is only "Universidade_Harvard". Maybe the user expects the answers to be in Portuguese. Let me check the instructions again. The user says the answers should be in Portuguese, as per the language requirement. So I need to make sure the answers are in Portuguese.

But the original context is in Portuguese, but the information about Harvard University is in English. However, the user might expect the answers to be in Portuguese, even if the context is in Portuguese. Wait, the user provided the context in Portuguese as "Universidade_Harvard", but the actual information about Harvard is in English. However, the user wants the answers in Portuguese. So I need to translate the answers into Portuguese.

Wait, but the user is asking for the answers to be correct based on the context. If the context is just the name "Universidade_Harvard", which is the Portuguese name for Harvard University, then the answers should be about the actual university in English, but presented in Portuguese. For example, the answer to "Where is Harvard University located?" would be "Em Cambridge, Massachusetts, nos Estados Unidos". So I need to make sure the answers are in Portuguese but based on actual facts about Harvard University.

So, I need to generate 10 questions in Portuguese, each with a correct answer in Portuguese, based on real facts about Harvard University.

Let me check the possible questions again, translating them into Portuguese and ensuring the answers are accurate.

1. Em que cidade está localizada a Universidade de Harvard? -> Resposta: Em Cambridge, Massachusetts, nos Estados Unidos.
2. Quando foi fundada a Universidade de Harvard? -> Resposta: Em 1636.
3. Qual é o nome do principal centro de estudos da Universidade de Harvard? -> Resposta: O Harvard Yard.
4. Quem é um famoso aluno da Universidade de Harvard? -> Resposta: Bill Gates.
5. Qual é o nome do principal biblioteca da Universidade de Harvard? -> Resposta: The Harvard Library.
6. Qual é o nome da faculdade de medicina da Universidade de Harvard? -> Resposta: Harvard Medical School.
7. Qual é o nome da faculdade de negócios da Universidade de Harvard? -> Resposta: Harvard Business School.
8. Qual é o nome da faculdade de ciências humanas e sociais da Universidade de Harvard? -> Resposta: Harvard Graduate School of Arts and Sciences.
9. Qual é o nome da faculdade de engenharia e ciências aplicadas da Universidade de Harvard? -> Resposta: Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences.
10. Qual é o nome da faculdade de saúde pública da Universidade de Harvard? -> Resposta: Harvard School of Public Health.

Wait, but the answers need to be in Portuguese. Let me check if these answers are correct in Portuguese. For example, "Harvard Yard" is the name of the central area, but in Portuguese, it's often referred to as "Harvard Yard" as a proper noun, so maybe that's okay. Also, the names of the schools are usually kept in English, but maybe translated. For example, "Harvard Medical School" in Portuguese would be "Escola de Medicina da Universidade de Harvard".

But the user might expect the answers to be in Portuguese, even if the names are in English. However, the instructions say the answers should be correct based on the context. Since the context is "Universidade_Harvard", which is the Portuguese name, the answers should be in Portuguese but based on the actual facts of Harvard University.

So, I need to make sure that the answers are accurate in Portuguese. Let me verify each one:

1. Cidade: Cambridge, Massachusetts, EUA. Correct.
2. Fundação: 1636. Correct.
3. Centro de estudos: Harvard Yard. Correct.
4. Aluno famoso: Bill Gates. Correct.
5. Biblioteca principal: Harvard Library. Correct.
6. Faculdade de medicina: Harvard Medical School. Correct.
7. Faculdade de negócios: Harvard Business School. Correct.
8. Faculdade de ciências humanas e sociais: Harvard Graduate School of Arts and Sciences. Correct.
9. Faculdade de engenharia: Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences. Correct.
10. Faculdade de saúde pública: Harvard School of Public Health. Correct.

These answers are accurate in Portuguese, even if the names of the schools are in English. The user might expect that since the context is in Portuguese, the answers should be in Portuguese, but the proper nouns (names of schools) are kept in English as they are official names. Therefore, the answers are correct.

Now, I need to ensure that the questions are varied and cover different aspects. The questions cover location, founding year, central area, notable alumni, main library, and different schools. That's 10 questions. Each is a different aspect. That should meet the user's requirements.

I need to present them in CSV format, with each pair in the format "pergunta;resposta", and no additional text. The user has specified to generate exactly 10 pairs, so I need to make sure that there are exactly 10 lines in the CSV.
