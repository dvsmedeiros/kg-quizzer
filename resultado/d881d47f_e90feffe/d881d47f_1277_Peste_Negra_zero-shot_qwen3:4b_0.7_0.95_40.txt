Okay, the user wants me to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the context provided, which is about the Black Death. Let me start by recalling the key points about the Black Death. It was a pandemic in the 14th century, caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis, primarily spread by fleas on rats. It had three main forms: bubonic, septicemic, and pneumonic. The pandemic led to a significant population decline in Europe, around 30-60% of the population. It's also known as the Great Plague, and the Bubonic plague is the most common form. The Black Death is considered the first major pandemic in recorded history, and it had social and economic impacts, including labor shortages and changes in social structures.

Now, I need to create 10 different questions that cover various aspects. Let me brainstorm possible questions. First, the cause of the Black Death. Then, the main form of the plague. The year it started. The main animal involved in its spread. The percentage of population decline. The name of the bacterium. The three forms of the plague. The social and economic impacts. The nickname for the plague. And the name of the disease in Latin.

Wait, the user specified that the context is "Peste_Negra", which translates to Black Death. So I should make sure all questions are in Portuguese. Let me check each point again to ensure they are accurate. The Black Death is also called the Great Plague, and the three forms are bubonic, septicemic, and pneumonic. The bacterium is Yersinia pestis. The main animal was rats, but the fleas that spread it were on rats. The percentage decline is around 30-60%, as per historical data. The social impacts include labor shortages and changes in social hierarchy. The economic impact is the shift in labor markets, leading to higher wages. The nickname is "Black Death" because of the blackened skin from the bubonic plague.

I need to ensure each question is unique and covers different aspects. Let me list them out:

1. What was the main cause of the Black Death?
2. What is the primary form of the Black Death?
3. In which year did the Black Death begin in Europe?
4. What was the main animal that carried the plague?
5. What percentage of the population was affected by the Black Death?
6. What is the name of the bacterium that causes the Black Death?
7. What are the three main forms of the Black Death?
8. What were the social and economic consequences of the Black Death?
9. What is the nickname for the Black Death?
10. What is the name of the disease in Latin?

Now, I need to translate these into Portuguese and ensure the answers are correct. Let me verify each one. For example, the Bubonic plague is the most common form. The year is 1347, but the pandemic started in 1347 and lasted until 1351. The main animal is rats, but the fleas that spread it were on rats. The percentage is 30-60%. The bacterium is Yersinia pestis. The three forms are bubonic, septicemic, and pneumonic. The social and economic consequences include labor shortages and changes in social structures, as well as economic shifts. The nickname is "Black Death" because of the blackened skin. The Latin name is "Peste Nigra".

I think that's all. Now, I'll structure them into the CSV format as specified, making sure each line is a question followed by the correct answer, separated by a semicolon, and in Portuguese.
