Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the provided context and facts about Jacksonville, Florida. First, I need to go through the context and facts carefully.

The context gives general info about Jacksonville: it's the most populous city in Florida, located in Duval County, founded in 1791, population in 2020, geographical details, historical background, and mentions the Super Bowl in 2005. The facts list a bunch of specific data points, like temperature records, events, people born or died there, sports teams, locations, etc.

I need to make sure each question is unique and covers different aspects. Let me start by picking different categories. For example, population, founding date, geographical location, historical events, temperature records, notable events, etc.

First question: What is the population of Jacksonville according to the 2020 census? The answer is nearly 950,000. That's from the context.

Second: When was Jacksonville founded? The context says founded in 1791.

Third: What is the geographical location? The context mentions it's on the St. Johns River, near Georgia and Miami.

Fourth: What is the historical significance of Fort Caroline? The context says it was a French colony in 1564.

Fifth: What's the highest temperature recorded in January? The facts say 85°F.

Sixth: When was the Super Bowl held in Jacksonville? The context mentions 2005.

Seventh: What's the official name? The facts mention "City of Jacksonville and Duval County".

Eighth: What's the lowest temperature in February? The facts state 10°F.

Ninth: What's the area in square miles? The context says 1935498000.0, but that's in square feet? Wait, the user might want the area in square miles. But the fact says "área terrestre 1935498000.0" which is 1,935,498,000 square feet. But maybe the user wants the answer as given. Alternatively, maybe the user expects the area in square miles, but since the fact is in square feet, I'll use that.

Tenth: What's the rank in population in the US? The context says 12th.

Wait, but the user said "exatamente 10 pares" and the example shows "posicao no ranking populacional 1". Wait, the context says "a 12ª mais populosa do país", so 12th. But in the facts, "Jacksonville, Florida possui posição no ranking populacional 1". That's conflicting. Wait, the context says "a 12ª mais populosa do país", but the fact says "posição no ranking populacional 1". That's a contradiction. Which one to use? The user probably wants to stick to the context, but the fact says 1. Maybe the fact is incorrect, but as per instructions, I should use the provided data. Wait, the user says "exclusivamente a partir do conteúdo fornecido". So I need to check if the fact is part of the context. Wait, the user provided "Contexto" and "Fatos" as separate sections. The facts are separate. So the user might have included conflicting data. But the instruction is to generate based on the context and facts. So if the fact says "posicao no ranking populacional 1", but the context says 12th, which is correct? Maybe the fact is a mistake, but as per the user's data, I have to use the facts. Wait, the user's instruction says "Gerar exatamente 10 pares... a partir do conteúdo fornecido". The content includes both the context and the facts. So I need to check both. The context says "a 12ª mais populosa do país", but the facts have "Jacksonville, Florida possui posição no ranking populacional 1". Which is correct? Maybe the fact is incorrect, but I have to use it as per the user's data. So perhaps the answer is 1st. But that's conflicting. Hmm. This is a problem. Maybe the user made a mistake, but I have to follow the data given. So for the question about ranking, the answer would be 1st based on the fact, even though the context says 12th. Alternatively, maybe the fact is referring to something else. But without more info, I have to go with the data provided. So I'll use the fact's "1" as the answer.

But this might be an error. However, the user said to generate based on the content provided, so I have to include that.

So, compiling the 10 pairs:

1. Pergunta: Qual é a população de Jacksonville segundo o censo de 2020? Resposta: Quase 950 mil habitantes.
2. Pergunta: Em que ano Jacksonville foi fundada? Resposta: 1791.
3. Pergunta: Onde está localizada Jacksonville geograficamente? Resposta: Na margem do Rio St. Johns, a 110 km da fronteira com a Geórgia e a 300 km de Miami.
4. Pergunta: Qual é a significância histórica de Fort Caroline? Resposta: Foi uma colônia francesa em 1564.
5. Pergunta: Qual é o recorde de temperatura mais alta em janeiro? Resposta: 85°F.
6. Pergunta: Quando foi realizado o Super Bowl em Jacksonville? Resposta: Em 2005.
7. Pergunta: Qual é o nome oficial de Jacksonville? Resposta: City of Jacksonville and Duval County.
8. Pergunta: Qual é o recorde de temperatura mais baixa em fevereiro? Resposta: 10°F.
9. Pergunta: Qual é a área terrestre de Jacksonville? Resposta: 1.935.498.000 pés quadrados.
10. Pergunta: Em que posição Jacksonville está no ranking populacional nos EUA? Resposta: 1º.

Wait, but the fact says "posicao no ranking populacional 1", but the context says 12th. This is conflicting. But since the user included both, I have to check if the fact is part of the content. Since the user included the facts, I have to use that. So the answer is 1st. However, this might be an error, but as per the instructions, I have to follow the data given.

I think that's it. Let me check again for uniqueness and coverage of different aspects.
