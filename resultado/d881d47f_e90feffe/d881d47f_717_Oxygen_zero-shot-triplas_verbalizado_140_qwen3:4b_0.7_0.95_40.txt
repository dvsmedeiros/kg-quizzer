Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the provided context and facts. First, I need to make sure I understand the context thoroughly. The text is about oxygen, covering its properties, uses, discovery, and related topics.

Looking at the facts provided, there's a lot of information about oxygen's atomic structure, its role in the atmosphere, its discovery by Scheele and Priestley, its uses in various industries, and its related concepts like ozone, photosynthesis, and medical applications. Also, there are mentions of images, templates, and other related terms.

I need to generate 10 unique questions that cover different aspects. Let me start by listing possible topics: atomic number, discovery, uses, atmospheric composition, medical uses, chemical properties, related compounds (like ozone), historical context, and maybe some of the images or models mentioned.

Wait, the user specified that the questions should be in Portuguese and based on the given context. I need to ensure each question is distinct and not repetitive. Let me check the facts again to find specific points. For example, the atomic number is 8, the symbol O, and its position in the periodic table. The discovery by Scheele and Priestley, the role in photosynthesis, uses in medical applications, the ozone layer, and so on.

I should also make sure that the answers are directly derived from the context. For instance, the fact that oxygen is the third most abundant element in the universe, or that it's used in breathing gases. Also, the mention of the ozone layer and its relation to UV radiation. The uses in industry, like steel production, and in space.

Let me structure each question to cover different aspects. Let me count: 1. Atomic number and symbol. 2. Discovery by Scheele and Priestley. 3. Uses in medical applications. 4. Role in the atmosphere. 5. Ozone layer. 6. Photosynthesis. 7. Industrial uses. 8. Chemical properties. 9. Related compounds. 10. Historical context.

Wait, I need to check if all these points are covered in the context. For example, the context mentions that oxygen is used in breathing gases, medical applications, and in the atmosphere. Also, the ozone layer is part of the context. The atomic number is 8, symbol O. The fact that it's a reactive nonmetal. The uses in steel production, welding, etc.

I should avoid repeating the same topic. Let me make sure each question is unique. Let me also check the examples given in the context to ensure accuracy. For example, the discovery by Scheele in 1773 and Priestley in 1774, with Priestley being prioritized. The ozone layer's role in protecting from UV radiation. The uses in space, medicine, and industry.

Now, I need to translate these points into Portuguese, ensuring that each question is clear and the answer is directly from the context. Also, make sure that the answers are correct and not inferred beyond the given text. For example, the answer for the use in breathing gases should be based on the context's mention of "aplicações habituais do oxigênio incluem... terapias de oxigénio e sistemas de suporte à vida..." and "breathing gas está relacionado a Oxygen".

I think that's all. Now, I'll structure the 10 pairs accordingly, ensuring they are in CSV format with semicolons and no extra text.
