Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format about the IPCC based on the provided context and facts. First, I need to parse the context and the RDF facts to extract relevant information.

Starting with the context: The IPCC was established in 1988 by UNEP and WMO under the UN. It doesn't conduct original research but synthesizes scientific findings. It has produced five major reports, the last in 2014. It received the Nobel Peace Prize in 2007.

Now, looking at the facts from the RDF data: The headquarters is in Geneva, Switzerland. The current chair is Hoesung Lee. Parent organizations are UNEP and WMO. There are mentions of various individuals associated with the IPCC, like Bert Bolin, Filippo Giorgi, etc. Also, the IPCC has a report on renewable energy and climate change mitigation.

Possible questions could be about the establishment year, parent organizations, headquarters, current chair, Nobel Prize, number of reports, the role of the IPCC, its founding members, the 2007 award, and the 2014 report.

Need to ensure that each question is unique and covers different aspects. Also, check that answers are directly from the context or facts. For example, the headquarters is Geneva, Switzerland, the current chair is Hoesung Lee, the Nobel Prize was in 2007, etc.

Avoid repeating similar questions. Make sure each answer is accurate. For example, the number of major reports is five, the last in 2014. The parent organizations are UNEP and WMO. The abbreviation is IPCC. The main function is synthesizing and disseminating scientific knowledge on climate change.

Need to make sure that the answers are concise and directly answer the question without extra information. Also, use the correct terminology, like "PNUMA" for UNEP in Portuguese and "OMM" for WMO.

Double-checking the facts: The first report was in 1990, the last in 2014. The Nobel Peace Prize was awarded in 2007. The chair is Hoesung Lee, and the headquarters is in Geneva, Switzerland.

Alright, compiling the 10 pairs now, ensuring variety and correctness.
