Okay, the user wants me to generate 10 pairs of questions and answers in CSV format based on the provided context and facts. Let me start by understanding the context and the facts given.

The context talks about steam engines, their function in thermal machines, and their use in various vessels and contexts. The facts list numerous ships, ferries, and other vessels that use steam engines as their propulsion or power source. There are also mentions of images, categories, and other related information.

I need to create questions that are relevant to the content. The key points from the context are that a steam engine is a thermal machine using steam pressure, it's based on thermodynamics, and it's used in various applications like ships, reactors, etc. The facts list a lot of specific examples of vessels and their propulsion types.

So the questions should be about the general concept of steam engines, their applications, and specific examples from the facts. I need to make sure each question is unique and covers different aspects. For example, one question could be about the principle of steam engines, another about their use in modern times, another about specific ships that use them, and so on.

I should check that each answer is directly from the context or the facts provided. For example, the fact that the USS Montclair has a steam engine, so a question could ask which vessel uses steam engine propulsion. Similarly, the context mentions that steam engines are used in reactors for electricity generation, so a question about that could be asked.

I need to avoid repeating the same type of question. For instance, if I ask about a specific ship, I shouldn't ask about another ship in the same category unless they are different. Also, the answers should be precise, like the correct category or the specific example from the list.

Let me start drafting the questions. First, the principle of steam engines. Then, the use in modern times (reactors). Then, specific ships like USS Montclair, SS Maui, etc. Also, maybe questions about images or categories associated with steam engines. Also, the fact that Thomas Newcomen is known for the steam engine. And the image representations mentioned.

I need to make sure that each question is unique and that the answers are correctly derived from the provided facts. Let me check each fact to ensure accuracy. For example, the USS General G. W. Goethals uses steam engine propulsion. The SS Ohio also uses steam engine propulsion. The category for steam engines is mentioned. The image representations are listed as well.

So, compiling all these into 10 distinct questions. Let me make sure that each question is different and covers various aspects: principle, application, examples, categories, images, historical figures, etc.
