Okay, the user wants me to generate 10 CSV question-answer pairs based on the context about "Vitória (Austrália)". Let me start by recalling the key points about Victoria, Australia. 

First, I need to make sure the questions are varied and cover different aspects. Let me think about the main topics: location, capital, population, landmarks, government, economy, history, culture, education, and maybe some unique facts.

Wait, the user specified that the context is "Vitória_(Austrália)", so I should focus on information related to the state of Victoria. Let me list possible questions:

1. What is the capital of Victoria? The answer is Melbourne.
2. What is the population of Victoria? Around 6.6 million.
3. What is the largest city in Victoria? Melbourne.
4. What is the official name of the state? Victoria.
5. What is the main economic activity? Tourism, manufacturing, agriculture.
6. What is the famous landmark? The Great Ocean Road, maybe the Mornington Peninsula.
7. What is the official language? English.
8. When was Victoria established as a state? 1851.
9. What is the highest point? Mount Buffalo or something else? Wait, maybe the highest point is Mount Baw Baw.
10. What is the nickname? The Garden State or something like that.

Wait, I need to check the accuracy of these facts. For example, the capital is indeed Melbourne. The population might be around 6.6 million. The largest city is Melbourne. The official name is Victoria. The economy includes tourism, manufacturing, agriculture. The Great Ocean Road is a famous landmark. The official language is English. Established in 1851. Highest point could be Mount Baw Baw. Nickname might be "The Garden State" or "The Sun City". 

I need to ensure each question is unique and covers different aspects. Let me structure the CSV with these points, making sure each pair is correct and follows the user's format. No markdown, just plain CSV. Also, check for any repeated questions. Alright, that should cover 10 varied questions.
