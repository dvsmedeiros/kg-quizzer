Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the provided context and facts about the Black Death. First, I need to make sure I understand the requirements thoroughly.

The context given is about the Black Death, its origins, spread, impact, and some details about the bacteria involved. The facts include a lot of technical information like categories, models, images, and other metadata, but the user emphasized that the questions must be based on the context and not the facts. Wait, no—the instructions say to generate questions based on both the context and the facts provided. Wait, no, looking back, the user says: "Gere pares de perguntas e respostas relevantes e corretas, exclusivamente a partir do conteúdo fornecido." So, only from the provided content. But the content includes both the context (in Portuguese) and the facts (which are in a structured format, possibly from a Wikipedia page or similar). However, the user's instruction says to generate questions based on the context and the facts. But I need to check the original query again.

Wait, the user says: "Gere pares de perguntas e respostas relevantes e corretas, exclusivamente a partir do conteúdo fornecido." So, the content includes both the context (the paragraph about the Black Death) and the facts (which are a list of key-value pairs, like "Black Death possui assunto Category:Plague pandemics", etc.). However, the user's instruction says that the questions must be related to the context presented below. Wait, in the original query, the user provided two sections: "Contexto" and "Fatos". The instruction says to generate questions based on the context and the facts. But the user's initial instruction says that the questions must be based on the context and the facts. However, in the "Regras" section, it says "As perguntas devem ser claramente relacionadas ao conteúdo apresentado abaixo." The "conteúdo apresentado abaixo" refers to the context and the facts. Wait, the context is the paragraph in Portuguese, and the facts are the structured data. But the user might have meant that the questions should be based on the context paragraph, not the facts. Because the facts are more technical metadata. However, the user included both the context and the facts as part of the content. So perhaps the questions can be based on both, but the context is the main source. However, the user's initial instruction says "exclusivamente a partir do conteúdo fornecido", which is the context and the facts. But the facts are more like metadata, not the main content. The user might have intended that the questions are based on the context paragraph, not the facts. But I need to check the original query again.

Looking back, the user's instruction says: "Gere pares de perguntas e respostas relevantes e corretas, exclusivamente a partir do conteúdo fornecido." The "conteúdo fornecido" includes both the context and the facts. However, the context is the main part, and the facts might be supplementary. However, the user might have intended that the questions are based on the context. The facts might include additional data that can be used. For example, the fact that the Black Death is categorized under "Category:Plague pandemics" could be a question. But the user might have wanted the questions to be based on the context paragraph. But the user didn't specify. However, the example in the initial query shows that the context is the main source, and the facts are additional metadata. The user might have intended that the questions are based on the context paragraph, not the facts. However, to be safe, I should consider both the context and the facts as possible sources for the questions. But the user's instruction says "exclusivamente a partir do conteúdo fornecido", which includes both parts. However, the facts are not in a narrative form but in key-value pairs. So perhaps the main source is the context paragraph. Let me proceed with that.

Now, the user wants 10 questions in CSV format, each with a question and answer. Each question must be relevant to the context, not repeated, and have a single correct answer that's explicit or inferable from the context. The answers must be in Portuguese, and the format is CSV with semicolons. Let me start by parsing the context.

The context mentions that the Black Death was the most devastating pandemic, causing 75-200 million deaths in Eurasia, peaking in Europe between 1347-1351. The cause was Yersinia pestis, with bubonic being the most common form. It was the first major European outbreak and the second pandemic. It led to religious, social, and economic upheavals. The origin was in Central or Eastern Asia, spread via the Silk Road, reaching Crimea in 1343, then spread by fleas on rats in Genoese merchant ships. It killed 30-60% of Europe's population, reducing the world population from 475M to 350-375M in the 14th century. Europe took 200 years to recover, with some regions like Florence recovering only in the 19th century. The plague returned multiple times until the early 20th century.

So, possible questions could be:

1. What was the estimated death toll of the Black Death in Eurasia?
2. What is the primary cause of the Black Death?
3. Which region was the origin of the Black Death?
4. How did the Black Death spread from Asia to Europe?
5. What percentage of Europe's population did the Black Death kill?
6. How long did it take for Europe's population to recover after the Black Death?
7. What was the impact of the Black Death on Europe's economy and society?
8. What are the three forms of plague caused by Yersinia pestis?
9. When did the Black Death reach Europe?
10. What was the estimated world population reduction due to the Black Death in the 14th century?

Now, I need to ensure that the answers are in Portuguese, and that each question is unique and not repeated. Also, the answers must be directly from the context or inferable. Let me check each point.

1. Death toll: 75-200 million (context says "morte de 75 a 200 milhões de pessoas na Eurásia").
2. Cause: Yersinia pestis (context says "bactéria Yersinia pestis").
3. Origin: Central or Eastern Asia (context says "originou na Ásia Central ou na Ásia Oriental").
4. Spread via Silk Road and fleas on rats (context says "spread via the Silk Road, reaching Crimea in 1343, then spread by fleas on rats in Genoese merchant ships").
5. 30-60% of Europe's population (context says "matar 30-60% da população europeia").
6. 200 years (context says "tomou 200 anos para recuperação").
7. Religious, social, and economic upheavals (context says "causou perturbações religiosas, sociais e econômicas").
8. Three forms: bubonic, septicemic, pneumonic (context mentions "bubônica sendo a mais comum", but the three forms are implied as it's the most common, and the other two are septicemic and pneumonic, though the context doesn't explicitly list them. Wait, the context says "três formas de cólera" (wait, no, in the context, it's "três formas de cólera" is not correct. The user's context says "três formas de cólera" but that's a mistake. Wait, the actual text in the context is "três formas de cólera" but that's incorrect. Wait, no, the user's context says "três formas de cólera" but that's a mistake. Wait, the user's context says: "três formas de cólera" but that's not correct. Let me check again. The user's context says: "três formas de cólera" but that's a typo. The correct term is plague, not cholera. The original context in Portuguese says: "três formas de cólera" but that's a mistake. Wait, looking back, the user's context says: "três formas de cólera" but that's a mistake. The correct term is "plague" (cólera is cholera). So that's a mistake in the user's context. However, the user's context says: "três formas de cólera" but that's a mistake. Wait, the actual text in the user's context is: "três formas de cólera" but that's incorrect. The correct term should be "plague" (cólera is cholera). So that's a mistake in the user's input. However, the user's context says "três formas de cólera" but that's a mistake. Therefore, the correct term is "plague", so the three forms would be bubonic, septicemic, and pneumonic. However, the context may not explicitly list all three, only mentions bubonic as the most common. Therefore, the question about the three forms may not be answerable from the context. So that might not be a valid question. Therefore, that question would be invalid. So I need to avoid that.

So, going back, the user's context may have a typo, but I have to work with what's provided. Assuming that "três formas de cólera" is a mistake and should be "plague", but the user's context may have intended that. However, if I take the user's context as written, then the answer would be "cólera", but that's incorrect. However, the user's context says: "a bactéria Yersinia pestis, com a forma bubônica sendo a mais comum". So, the three forms are not listed, but the context only mentions bubonic as the most common. Therefore, the question about the three forms might not be answerable from the context. So that's a problem. Therefore, I need to avoid that question.

So, the valid questions are the ones listed above, excluding the one about the three forms. Let me check again.

So, the 10 questions would be:

1. What was the estimated death toll of the Black Death in Eurasia?
2. What is the primary cause of the Black Death?
3. Which region was the origin of the Black Death?
4. How did the Black Death spread from Asia to Europe?
5. What percentage of Europe's population did the Black Death kill?
6. How long did it take for Europe's population to recover after the Black Death?
7. What was the impact of the Black Death on Europe's economy and society?
8. When did the Black Death reach Europe?
9. What was the estimated world population reduction due to the Black Death in the 14th century?
10. What was the name of the most common form of plague caused by Yersinia pestis?

Now, translating these into Portuguese and ensuring the answers are from the context.

But the user's context is in Portuguese, so the questions and answers need to be in Portuguese. Wait, the user's instruction says the answers must be in Portuguese. Wait, no, the user's instruction says "respostas" in Portuguese, but the questions can be in Portuguese or English? The user's instruction says that the questions and answers should be in Portuguese, but the original context is in Portuguese, so the questions and answers should be in Portuguese. Wait, the user's instruction says: "respostas" in Portuguese, but the questions? The user's instruction says: "Gere agora os 10 pares `pergunta;resposta` conforme as instruções e regras acima." So the questions and answers are in Portuguese. Therefore, the questions and answers must be in Portuguese.

Therefore, the 10 questions in Portuguese would be:

1. Qual foi a estimativa da quantidade de mortos pela Peste Negra na Eurásia?
2. Qual é a causa principal da Peste Negra?
3. Qual região foi a origem da Peste Negra?
4. Como a Peste Negra se espalhou da Ásia para a Europa?
5. Qual percentual da população europeia a Peste Negra matou?
6. Quanto tempo levou para a população europeia se recuperar após a Peste Negra?
7. Qual foi o impacto da Peste Negra na economia e sociedade europeias?
8. Quando a Peste Negra chegou à Europa?
9. Qual foi a estimativa da redução da população mundial devido à Peste Negra no século XIV?
10. Qual era o nome da forma mais comum de cólera causada pela bactéria Yersinia pestis?

But wait, in the context, the user says "formas de cólera" which is a mistake. Assuming that the correct term is "plague", so the answer to question 10 would be "formas de cólera" but that's incorrect. However, the user's context says "formas de cólera", but that's a mistake. Therefore, the answer to question 10 would be "formas de cólera" but that's not correct. However, the user's context may have intended "plague", so the answer would be "a forma bubônica sendo a mais comum". Therefore, the answer to question 10 is "a forma bubônica".

So, adjusting the questions and answers accordingly.

Now, I need to ensure that each answer is directly from the context. For example:

1. Qual foi a estimativa da quantidade de mortos pela Peste Negra na Eurásia? → "75 a 200 milhões de pessoas"

2. Qual é a causa principal da Peste Negra? → "bactéria Yersinia pestis"

3. Qual região foi a origem da Peste Negra? → "Ásia Central ou na Ásia Oriental"

4. Como a Peste Negra se espalhou da Ásia para a Europa? → "via a Rota da Seda, chegando à Crimeia em 1343, e depois se espalhou por pulgas em ratos em navios mercantis genoveses"

5. Qual percentual da população europeia a Peste Negra matou? → "30-60% da população europeia"

6. Quanto tempo levou para a população europeia se recuperar após a Peste Negra? → "tomou 200 anos para recuperação"

7. Qual foi o impacto da Peste Negra na economia e sociedade europeias? → "causou perturbações religiosas, sociais e econômicas"

8. Quando a Peste Negra chegou à Europa? → "chegou à Europa entre 1347 e 1351"

9. Qual foi a estimativa da redução da população mundial devido à Peste Negra no século XIV? → "a população mundial reduziu-se de 475 milhões para 350-375 milhões"

10. Qual era o nome da forma mais comum de cólera causada pela bactéria Yersinia pestis? → "a forma bubônica"

But I need to check the context again to ensure that the answers are accurate. For example, in the context, it says "chegando à Crimeia em 1343, e depois se espalhou por pulgas em ratos em navios mercantis genoveses". So that's the answer for question 4.

Also, the context says "tomou 200 anos para recuperação" for question 6.

Now, the user's instruction says to generate 10 pairs, so I need to make sure that there are exactly 10, each unique, and the answers are from the context.

I think that covers all the necessary points. Now, translating these into Portuguese and formatting them as per the user's request.
