Okay, I need to generate 10 pairs of questions and answers based on the provided context about the Yuan Dynasty. Let me start by understanding the information given.

The context mentions that the Yuan Dynasty was established in 1271 by Kublai Khan, a descendant of Genghis Khan. It also lists various facts such as notable figures, events, locations, and related terms.

I should create questions that cover different aspects: dates, rulers, key events, territories, etc. Each question must have a clear, single correct answer derived from the context.

First, I'll think about important dates. The dynasty was founded in 1271 and fell in 1368. That's two questions right there.

Next, who were the founders? Kublai Khan is mentioned as the founder, so that's another question.

Looking at significant events or battles, there are mentions like the Battle of Lake Poyang and the Red Turban Rebellion. These can be turned into questions about major conflicts during their rule.

I also see that important figures like Emperor Gong of Song died during this dynasty. That could be a question about notable deaths.

The Yuan Dynasty used specific titles; for example, Kublai Khan held certain titles which I can include in a question.

I should vary the types of questions: some about dates, others about people, events, and territories. This ensures each question is unique and covers different aspects.

Let me list out potential questions:

1. When was the Yuan Dynasty established?
   - 1271

2. Who founded the Yuan Dynasty?
   - Kublai Khan

3. In which year did the Yuan Dynasty end?
   - 1368

4. What major battle took place during the Yuan Dynasty?
   - Battle of Lake Poyang

5. Which rebellion occurred under the Yuan rule?
   - Red Turban Rebellion

6. Who was a significant figure that died in the Yuan period?
   - Emperor Gong of Song

7. What title did Kublai Khan hold in the Yuan Dynasty?
   - Great Khan

8. How large was the Yuan territory in square kilometers?
   - 11,000,000

9. Which rebellion is associated with the fall of Yuan?
   - Red Turban Rebellion

10. What notable person died during this period?
    - Emperor Gong of Song

I need to make sure each answer is directly from the context and that there are no repeated questions. Also, the questions should be clear and varied.
