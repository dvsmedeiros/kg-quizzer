Okay, I need to generate 10 CSV pairs based on the provided context and facts about the Huguenots. Let me start by understanding the content thoroughly.

First, the main context is about the Huguenots being French Protestants during the religious wars in the late 16th century. They faced persecution under Louis XIV, leading to their exodus after the revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685. They were mostly Calvinist, part of the Reformed Church, while some in Alsace, Moselle, and Montbéliard were Lutheran. 

Looking at the facts, there are a lot of Wikipedia template references, image captions, categories, and related topics. For example, the Edict of Nantes was revoked in 1685, leading to their expulsion. The term "Huguenot" comes from a French term for "Huguenot," possibly from a person named Hugues. There's mention of the Massacre of St. Bartholomew's Day in 1572, which was a significant event. Also, the Huguenots had a diaspora, with communities in places like Orange County, New York, and Staten Island. 

Now, the user wants 10 distinct questions and answers. They need to be varied and cover different aspects. Let me brainstorm possible questions:

1. When was the Edict of Nantes revoked? (Answer: 1685)
2. What was the main religion of the Huguenots? (Answer: Calvinism)
3. Which event in 1572 is associated with the Huguenots? (Answer: Massacre of St. Bartholomew's Day)
4. Which French king persecuted the Huguenots? (Answer: Louis XIV)
5. Where were the Huguenots mainly located in France? (Answer: Southern and central regions)
6. What was the main reason for the Huguenots' exodus? (Answer: Revocation of the Edict of Nantes)
7. Which group was the Huguenot community in Alsace, Moselle, and Montbéliard mainly associated with? (Answer: Lutheran)
8. Which American location was named after the Huguenots? (Answer: Orange County, New York)
9. What was the name of the conspiracy against the House of Guise? (Answer: Amboise Conspiracy)
10. What is the origin of the term "Huguenot"? (Answer: Derived from a French term for a person named Hugues)

Wait, I need to ensure each question is unique and covers different aspects. Let me check the facts again. There's also mention of the French Wars of Religion, which were from 1562-1598. The Edict of Nantes was issued in 1598, ending the wars. The Huguenots were part of the Reformed Church, which is Calvinist. The term "Huguenot" might come from a person named Hugues, as in Besançon Hugues. The Massacre of St. Bartholomew's Day is a key event. 

Let me structure the questions to cover these points. Also, need to avoid repetition. For example, the Edict of Nantes is mentioned in both context and facts. The answer to the first question is 1685. The second could be their main religion, Calvinism. Third, the massacre in 1572. Fourth, Louis XIV. Fifth, their location in France. Sixth, the reason for exodus. Seventh, the Lutheran group. Eighth, Orange County. Ninth, the Amboise Conspiracy. Tenth, the origin of the term.

I need to make sure the answers are accurate and directly from the context. Also, check that the questions are clear and not redundant. Let me list them out again to confirm. Each question should have one correct answer. That should make 10 distinct pairs. Now, format them into CSV as specified.
