Okay, I need to create a CSV with 10 question-answer pairs based on the provided context and facts about the IPCC. Let me start by carefully reading through all the information given.

The context explains that the IPCC was founded in 1988 by the UN, specifically by UNEP and WMO. Its main goal is to synthesize climate change knowledge, not produce original research. It's known for its reports every few years and won a Nobel Peace Prize in 2007.

Looking at the facts section, there are various details like the IPCC's type classifications (e.g., Organisation, Agent), its leaders (like Hoesung Lee), associated individuals (Julie Arblaster, etc.), and other related organizations (WMO, UNEP). Also, it mentions that the IPCC is a panel and has specific categories like WikicatClimateChangeOrganizations.

Now, I need to come up with 10 varied questions covering different aspects. Let's brainstorm possible topics:

1. Formation details: year founded, by whom.
2. Purpose/mission: why it was created.
3. Reports: how often or when they're produced.
4. Recognition: Nobel Prize.
5. Structure: leaders, working groups.
6. Affiliated organizations: WMO, UNEP.
7. Headquarters location.
8. Types/classifications of the IPCC.
9. Key individuals associated with it.
10. Its role in climate change discussions.

I should ensure each question has a clear, single correct answer based on the provided data. Let me draft them one by one and check against the facts to confirm accuracy.

Wait, some points might be overlapping or too similar. I need to vary the questions to cover different aspects without repetition. For example, instead of asking about leaders twice, focus on different roles or structures each time.

Also, making sure that the answers are specific—like exact years, names, or locations where applicable. Avoid vague questions that could have multiple interpretations.

Let me structure them now:

1. When was the IPCC established? → 1988
2. What is its main goal? → Synthesize climate change knowledge.
3. How often does it release reports? → Every few years (though specific intervals vary).
4. Where is its headquarters? → Geneva, Switzerland.
5. Who won a Nobel Prize related to the IPCC? → The IPCC itself in 2007.
6. Which organizations created it? → UNEP and WMO.
7. What type of entity is the IPCC classified as? → Organisation, Agent, etc.
8. Name one leader: → Hoesung Lee (current Chair).
9. What does the acronym IPCC stand for? → Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.
10. Which individuals are associated with it? → Julie Arblaster, Filippo Giorgi.

Wait, I think some of these might not directly align with the facts. For instance, point 3 mentions reports every few years, but in the context, it says five major reports since its founding, with the last in 2014. Maybe a better question would be about the number or timeframe of reports.

Also, for point 5, it's the IPCC that won the Nobel Peace Prize, not an individual. So phrasing is crucial there.

I should ensure each answer is directly supported by the information given. Let me adjust:

1. Year founded: 1988
2. Main purpose: Assess climate change impacts.
3. Number of major reports: Five as of the context.
4. Headquarters location: Geneva, Switzerland.
5. Nobel Prize year: 2007.
6. Founder organizations: UNEP and WMO.
7. Leader's name: Hoesung Lee (Chair).
8. Type classifications: Organisation, Agent, etc.
9. Full form of IPCC: Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.
10. Key individuals associated: Filippo Giorgi.

This way, each question is unique and covers different aspects without overlap. I'll make sure the answers are concise and accurate based on the provided data.
