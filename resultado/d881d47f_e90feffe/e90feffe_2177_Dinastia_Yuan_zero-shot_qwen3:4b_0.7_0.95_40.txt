Okay, the user wants me to generate 10 pairs of questions and answers in CSV format based on the context provided, which is about the Yuan Dynasty. Let me start by recalling what I know about the Yuan Dynasty.

First, the Yuan Dynasty was established by Kublai Khan, right? So a question could be about the founder. Then, the capital was Dadu, which is now Beijing. That's a key point. The Mongol Empire's influence, especially with Genghis Khan's legacy, is important. The Yuan Dynasty's reign lasted from 1271 to 1368, so a question on that time period makes sense.

The Mongols were the ruling group, so that's another point. The Yuan Dynasty's impact on China, like the use of paper money and the Great Wall's role, could be topics. Also, the Pax Mongolica, which was a period of relative peace and trade, might be a question. The influence of Islamic culture in the Yuan era is another aspect. The end of the Yuan Dynasty was due to internal conflicts and peasant uprisings, so that's a possible question.

I need to make sure each question is unique and covers different aspects. Let me list out possible questions:

1. Founder of the Yuan Dynasty.
2. Capital city of the Yuan Dynasty.
3. Ruler who established the Yuan Dynasty.
4. Time period of the Yuan Dynasty.
5. Ruling group during the Yuan Dynasty.
6. Impact of the Yuan Dynasty on China.
7. The Great Wall's role during the Yuan Dynasty.
8. Pax Mongolica and its significance.
9. Influence of Islamic culture in the Yuan Dynasty.
10. Cause of the end of the Yuan Dynasty.

Now, I need to check if these are all based on the given context. The user provided the context as "Dinastia_Yuan", but since there's no actual content provided, I have to rely on my existing knowledge. However, the user might have intended that the context is the information I have. Let me make sure each answer is accurate. For example, the capital was indeed Dadu, and the ruler was Kublai Khan. The time period is correct. The Pax Mongolica was a period of peace and trade under the Mongols. The Great Wall was rebuilt during the Yuan, and Islamic culture had an influence due to the Mongol Empire's reach.

I should avoid repeating similar questions. For instance, not asking about the founder and then the ruler again. Each question should be distinct. Also, the answers should be concise and directly answer the question. Let me structure them into the CSV format as specified, ensuring the separator is a semicolon and no extra text.
