pergunta;resposta
Next; I need to form questions that ask about these properties. The user wants questions that start with "Which private school...?" and the answers should be the school name. Each question should target a different property or aspect. 
- ns2:schooltype: St. Andrew's Episcopal School; Tri-City Christian School
I'll proceed to generate 10 pairs; using the unique properties where possible and then using the general type property for others.
   **Resposta:** Saint Pius X College; Bodo City
