Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs based on the provided context and facts. Let me start by carefully reading through the context and facts to identify key points that can form the basis of the questions.

First, the context mentions the IPCC was established in 1988 by the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). That's a key point. Also, it's important to note that the IPCC doesn't conduct original research but synthesizes existing scientific knowledge. The Nobel Peace Prize in 2007 is another significant detail.

Looking at the facts, there's a lot of information about the IPCC's structure, such as its chairperson (Hoesung Lee), its location (Geneva, Switzerland), and its parent organizations (UNEP and WMO). There are also mentions of specific people associated with the IPCC, like Filippo Giorgi and Julie Arblaster. The organization has produced five major reports, with the last one in 2014.

I need to ensure the questions are varied and cover different aspects. Let's start with the establishment date and the organizations involved. Then, move to its location, leadership, the Nobel Prize, the number of reports, its role in policy-making, and specific individuals associated with it.

Wait, the facts mention that the IPCC is abbreviated as IPCC. That's a bit redundant, but maybe a question about the acronym could be useful. Also, the fact that it's a Panel and a Working Group, but I should check the context for that. The context says it's a scientific-political organization, so maybe a question on its nature.

I need to avoid repeating similar questions. For example, if I ask about the founding organizations, I shouldn't have another question on the same topic. Let me list possible questions:

1. When was the IPCC established?
2. Which organizations established the IPCC?
3. Where is the IPCC headquartered?
4. Who is the current chairperson of the IPCC?
5. What prize did the IPCC receive in 2007?
6. How many major reports has the IPCC produced?
7. What is the primary role of the IPCC?
8. Which individuals are associated with the IPCC?
9. What is the acronym for the IPCC?
10. What are the parent organizations of the IPCC?

Now, cross-referencing with the facts and context to ensure accuracy. For example, the answer to question 2 is UNEP and WMO. The headquarters are in Geneva. The Nobel Peace Prize in 2007. Five major reports, with the last in 2014. The acronym is IPCC. The parent organizations are UNEP and WMO. The chairperson is Hoesung Lee. The role is synthesizing and disseminating scientific knowledge on climate change. Associated individuals include Filippo Giorgi, Julie Arblaster, etc.

I need to make sure each answer is directly from the provided information. Also, avoid making up details not mentioned. For example, the context says the IPCC has produced five major reports, so the answer should be five. The last report was in 2014, so that's a separate question.

Now, structuring each question and answer pair, ensuring they are in Portuguese and follow the CSV format. Let me check the examples provided to match the style. The examples use semicolons and have concise answers. Also, the answers should be specific and not include extra information beyond what's given.

Double-checking for any repetition. Each question should cover a different aspect. For example, one question about the establishment date, another about the founding organizations, another about the headquarters, and so on.

I think that's all. Now, compiling the 10 pairs accordingly.
