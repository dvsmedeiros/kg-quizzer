Okay, I need to generate 10 CSV pairs of questions and answers based on the provided context about the Huguenots. Let me start by understanding the context and facts given.

The context mentions that Huguenots were French Protestants during the religious wars in the late 16th century. They faced persecution under Louis XIV, leading to their expulsion after the revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685. They were mainly Calvinist, part of the Reformed Church, and some in Alsace, Moselle, and Montbéliard were Lutheran. There are also mentions of their diaspora, places named after them, and some RDF data about their history and related topics.

The facts include various RDF triples, like Camisards being a subset of Huguenots, the Catholic Church in France having separations from Huguenots, and places in the US named after them. Also, there are URLs, dates, and categories related to their history and diaspora.

Now, I need to create 10 varied questions. Let me list possible questions:

1. What were the Huguenots?
   - Answer: French Protestants during the religious wars in the 16th century.

2. When was the Edict of Nantes revoked, leading to their persecution?
   - Answer: 1685.

3. What was the main religion of the Huguenots?
   - Answer: Calvinism.

4. Which regions had Lutheran Huguenots?
   - Answer: Alsace, Moselle, and Montbéliard.

5. Who was responsible for the persecution under the revocation of the Edict of Nantes?
   - Answer: Louis XIV.

6. What is the name of the diaspora associated with Huguenots?
   - Answer: French diaspora.

7. Which US location is named after Huguenots?
   - Answer: Orange County, New York (and Staten Island).

8. What is the significance of the Camisards in relation to Huguenots?
   - Answer: They are a subset or related group.

9. What are some notable places associated with Huguenots in the US?
   - Answer: Orange County, New York; Staten Island.

10. What is the historical context of the Huguenots' persecution?
    - Answer: Religious wars in France, leading to their expulsion.

Wait, some of these might overlap. Let me check for repetition. For example, questions 7 and 9 might be similar. I need to ensure each question is distinct. Also, the answer to question 7 should be specific, like "Orange County, New York" and "Staten Island." 

Another point: the answer to question 3 should be "Calvinism" as they were majoritarily Calvinist. Question 4 should mention the regions. Question 5 is about Louis XIV. Question 6 is French diaspora. Question 10 can be more specific about the religious wars and expulsion.

I need to make sure each question is unique and covers different aspects. Let me adjust the questions to ensure variety and correctness based on the context provided. Let me finalize the 10 pairs.
