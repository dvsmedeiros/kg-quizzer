Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to generate 10 pairs of questions and answers in CSV format based on the provided context and facts about the IPCC. The main points to remember are that the questions must be varied, cover different aspects of the content, and the answers must be directly from the context or inferable from it. Also, no repetition of similar questions.

First, I need to go through the context and facts provided. The context gives information about the IPCC's establishment, purpose, structure, key people, and achievements. The facts are in a structured format with various properties like headquarter, leaders, parent organizations, etc.

I should start by identifying key facts. For example, the IPCC was created in 1988 by UNEP and WMO. It's part of the UN, has a headquarters in Geneva, and has had several leaders. There's mention of the Nobel Peace Prize in 2007, the number of reports (five), and some names of people associated with it.

Now, I need to form questions that cover these points. Let's list possible question topics:

1. Establishment details (year, founding organizations)
2. Purpose and role
3. Structure and leadership (headquarters, leaders, their roles)
4. Achievements (Nobel Prize, reports)
5. Key people (names, their roles)
6. Organizational details (parent organizations, classifications)

I need to ensure each question is unique and covers different aspects. Let's start drafting:

1. When was the IPCC established? Answer: 1988.
2. Which UN agencies founded the IPCC? Answer: UNEP and WMO.
3. What is the main objective of the IPCC? Answer: To synthesize and disseminate knowledge on climate change.
4. Where is the IPCC headquartered? Answer: Geneva, Switzerland.
5. Who was the first chairperson of the IPCC? Answer: Bert Bolin.
6. Which organization is the IPCC part of? Answer: United Nations.
7. How many major reports has the IPCC published? Answer: Five.
8. When did the IPCC receive the Nobel Peace Prize? Answer: 2007.
9. What is the name of the current chairperson? Answer: Hoesung Lee.
10. What is the primary focus of the IPCC's work? Answer: Climate change, specifically global warming.

Wait, some of these might be too similar. For example, the first and second questions are about establishment. Need to check for variety. Also, ensure answers are strictly from the context. Let me cross-verify each answer against the context and facts.

The context says: "criada em 1988 no âmbito das Nações Unidas (ONU) pela iniciativa do Programa das Nações Unidas para o Meio Ambiente (PNUMA) e da Organização Meteorológica Mundial (OMM)." So the answer for question 2 is PNUMA and OMM. The first question's answer is 1988.

The purpose is "sintetizar e divulgar o conhecimento mais avançado sobre as mudanças climáticas... aquecimento global, apontando suas causas, efeitos e riscos..." So the answer for question 3 is that.

Headquarters: "Geneva" as per the facts. The current chair is Hoesung Lee, as per the facts. The first chair was Bert Bolin, as per the facts. The Nobel was in 2007. The number of reports is five, as per the context. The primary focus is climate change, specifically global warming.

I need to make sure each question is distinct. Let me check the examples provided. The examples include questions about the organization's structure, leaders, dates, etc. So I should follow that pattern but ensure no repetition.

Another possible question: What is the role of the IPCC in climate policy? Answer: It's the main basis for global and national climate policies.

But the context says "tem sido a principal base para as políticas climáticas globais e nacionais." So that's a valid question.

Another one: What is the abbreviation for the IPCC? Answer: IPCC (from the facts, ns2:abbreviation "IPCC").

But the user's examples include "Quais organizações da ONU estabeleceram o IPCC?" so similar structure.

I need to ensure 10 unique questions. Let me compile them now, checking against the context and facts to ensure accuracy.
