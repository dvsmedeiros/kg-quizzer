Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs based on the provided data about Fresno, California. Let me start by looking through the data to find relevant information.

First, the data includes various properties like area, population, historical facts, and some examples. The examples given are about the fifth largest city, distance to LA, meaning of the name, flag symbols, pronunciation, railway establishment year, reasons for migration, incorporation year, number of streetcars in 1931, and the entity that spurred growth.

I need to create similar questions but ensure they are different from the examples. Let me check the data again for other details. There's info on the area, population density, metro population, and some landmarks like Selland Arena, The Big Fresno Fair, and the United States District Court. Also, there are mentions of people born or died in Fresno, like William Saroyan and Tom Seaver.

I can ask about the population of Fresno, the area in square miles, the name of the court, the founder of the city, the main industries, the nickname, the number of neighborhoods, the main river, the average temperature, and the main economic sectors. Wait, but I need to make sure the answers are present in the data.

Looking at the data, the population metro is 1,008,654. The area total is 300.43 km². The United States District Court for the Eastern District of California is located there. The city's name comes from the Spanish word for ash tree. The nickname is "The Fresno". The main industries might be agriculture, as Fresno is known for that. The main river is the San Joaquin River. The average temperature isn't directly mentioned, but maybe the climate type? The data doesn't have that. The economic sectors could be agriculture, manufacturing, etc., but not sure. The number of neighborhoods? The data mentions "Metropolitan Fresno" as a subdivision, but not specific neighborhoods. Maybe the number of schools or something else?

I need to ensure that each question has a clear answer in the data. Let me list possible questions:

1. What is the population of Fresno, California? Answer: 506,455 (from the data, but wait, the data says "populationMetro" is 1,008,654. The city's population might be different. Wait, the data for the city of Fresno might have a different number. But the data provided here doesn't have the city's population, only the metro. So maybe I can't use that. Hmm.)

Wait, the data for the city of Fresno includes "populationMetro" as 1,008,654. But the actual city population might be different. However, since the data only provides metro, maybe I can ask about the metro population.

Another point: The data says "areaTotalKm" is 300.43. So a question could be "What is the total area of Fresno in square kilometers?" Answer: 300.43.

Another example: "What is the population density of Fresno in people per square mile?" The data has "populationDensitySqMi" as 4722.6.

What about the name of the court? "United States District Court for the Eastern District of California" is located there.

The nickname "The Fresno" is mentioned as "populationDemonym" is "Fresnan", but the nickname might be "The Fresno".

The data mentions "Metropolitan Fresno" as a subdivision, so maybe "What is the subdivision name of Fresno?" Answer: Metropolitan Fresno.

The data also has "wikiPageUsesTemplate" with templates like "Template:USPopulousCities", so maybe "Which template is used on Fresno's Wikipedia page?" But that's more technical and might not be a common question.

Another point: The data includes "Selland Arena" as a location. So "What is the name of the major arena in Fresno?" Answer: Selland Arena.

"The Big Fresno Fair" is mentioned, so "What is the name of the annual fair in Fresno?" Answer: The Big Fresno Fair.

The data also lists people born or died there, like William Saroyan. So "Who is a famous person born in Fresno?" Answer: William Saroyan.

But need to check if the data has that. Yes, "William_Saroyan" has "deathPlace" as Fresno.

Another question: "What is the main river that flows through Fresno?" The data doesn't explicitly mention a river, but Fresno is in the San Joaquin Valley, so maybe the San Joaquin River. But the data doesn't have that. Maybe not safe to assume.

Alternatively, the data mentions "Las Palmas, Fresno, California" with type "Fresno, California". Not sure.

Another idea: The data includes "areaLand" as 297,304,700.0 and "areaTotal" as 300,430,000.0. So "What is the land area of Fresno in square meters?" Answer: 297,304,700.0. But that's specific and maybe not commonly asked.

Alternatively, "What is the total area of Fresno in square meters?" Answer: 300,430,000.0.

But the user might prefer more standard units. Since the data has "areaTotalKm" as 300.43, maybe use that.

So possible questions:

1. What is the total area of Fresno in square kilometers? Answer: 300.43.

2. What is the population density of Fresno in people per square mile? Answer: 4722.6.

3. What is the name of the major arena in Fresno? Answer: Selland Arena.

4. What is the name of the annual fair held in Fresno? Answer: The Big Fresno Fair.

5. Which federal court is located in Fresno? Answer: United States District Court for the Eastern District of California.

6. What is the nickname of Fresno? Answer: The Fresno.

7. What is the population of the Fresno metropolitan area? Answer: 1,008,654.

8. What is the birthplace of William Saroyan? Answer: Fresno, California.

9. What is the subdivision name of Fresno? Answer: Metropolitan Fresno.

10. What is the meaning of the name Fresno in Spanish? Answer: Ash tree (freixo).

Wait, the data says "O que o nome Fresno significa em espanhol?;freixo" in the examples. So that's covered. But maybe a different angle: "What is the origin of the name Fresno?" Answer: Spanish for ash tree.

I need to make sure the answers are exactly as per the data. For example, the data says "populationDemonym" is "Fresnan", so a question could be "What is the demonym for residents of Fresno?" Answer: Fresnan.

Another question: "What is the area of Fresno in square meters?" Answer: 300,430,000.0 (from "areaTotal").

But maybe the user prefers more common units. However, the data provides these numbers, so it's valid.

So compiling 10 questions:

1. What is the total area of Fresno in square kilometers?;300.43

2. What is the population density of Fresno in people per square mile?;4722.6

3. What is the name of the major arena in Fresno?;Selland Arena

4. What is the name of the annual fair held in Fresno?;The Big Fresno Fair

5. Which federal court is located in Fresno?;United States District Court for the Eastern District of California

6. What is the nickname of Fresno?;The Fresno

7. What is the population of the Fresno metropolitan area?;1008654

8. What is the birthplace of William Saroyan?;Fresno, California

9. What is the subdivision name of Fresno?;Metropolitan Fresno

10. What is the meaning of the name Fresno in Spanish?;freixo

I need to check if these are all present in the data. For example, "The Big Fresno Fair" is mentioned, yes. "Selland Arena" is there. The court is listed. The subdivision name is "Metropolitan Fresno". The demonym is "Fresnan", but the question here is about the nickname. The examples have "Fresno" as the fifth largest city, so maybe the nickname is "The Fresno" as per the data.

Yes, this should cover 10 valid pairs.
