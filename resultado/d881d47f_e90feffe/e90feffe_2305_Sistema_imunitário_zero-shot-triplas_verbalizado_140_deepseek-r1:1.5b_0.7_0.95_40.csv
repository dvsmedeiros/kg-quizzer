What are the primary functions of macrophages in the immune system?;Macrophages help in dealing with infection by destroying infected cells.
Which type of cell is primarily responsible for recognizing and responding to pathogens?;Adaptive T-Cells (ACT) recognize and respond to pathogens.
How do adaptive T-cells generate antibodies to target pathogens?;Adaptive T-cells produce specific antibodies that can cross the blood-brain barrier to attack antigens on target cells.
What procedure helps enhance the immune response by stimulating T-cell LNs?;The T-cell LNM procedure involves inducing a stronger immune response through T-cells.
Which cells are part of the lymphatic system and play a key role in immune responses?;T-Cell Lymph Node Stimulation (T-cell LNS) is a procedure that uses T-cells to stimulate the immune system, aiding in immune response enhancement.
What does natural killer cells (NKT) do in the immune response process?;NKT cells are fast killing cells that target specific pathogens and trigger adaptive immunity.
How are macrophages involved in the fight against infections?;Macrophages play a critical role by engulfing, destroying, and breaking down infected cells during the infection process.
Which part of the immune system is responsible for activating T-cells to recognize antigens?;Adaptive T-Cells (ACT) activate T-cells to recognize and target pathogens.
What cells are considered primary immune response molecules?;Antigens are proteins or small organic molecules that present themselves to the immune system, while cells like macrophages and T-cells form complexes with them to initiate an immune response.
How do white blood cells help in recognizing and attacking pathogens?;White blood cells, including macrophages, neutrophils, monocytes, basophiles, and lymphocytes, recognize pathogens by engulfing, destroying, or breaking down infected cells.
