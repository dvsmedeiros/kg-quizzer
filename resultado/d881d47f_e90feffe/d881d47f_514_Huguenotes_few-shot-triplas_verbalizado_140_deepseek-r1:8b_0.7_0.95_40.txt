Okay, I need to create 10 pairs of questions and correct answers in CSV format based on the given context about Huguenots. Let me start by understanding the key points from the context.

The Huguenots were French Protestants during the Religious Wars in the second half of the 16th century. They faced persecution, especially after Louis XIV revoked the Edict of Nantes in 1685. Around 300,000 Huguenots fled France, many settling in other regions like South and central France.

I should make sure each question is unique and covers different aspects of their history. Let me brainstorm some possible questions:

1. **Where was most of the Huguenote population in France?** - Southern and central areas.
2. **What was the proportion of Huguenots to Catholics at peak?** - About an eighth.
3. **When did the Religious Wars take place?** - From 1562 to 1598.
4. **Which treaty ended the Religious Wars?** - The Edict of Nantes.
5. **What did this edict grant Huguenots?** - Substantial religious, political autonomy.
6. **What was the original term for Huguenote used as a slur?** - Derision.
7. **Which Swiss politician is associated with the Calvinist movement?** - Besançon Hugues.
8. **What city was the center of Calvinism in Switzerland?** - Geneva.
9. **What was the name of the conspiracy to overthrow the House of Guise?** - Amboise.
10. **When did this attempt occur?** - 1560.

Now, I'll ensure each question is clear and directly related to the context. Also, check that each answer is accurate based on the provided facts.
