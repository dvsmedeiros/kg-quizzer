Okay, the user wants me to generate 10 objective questions and answers in CSV format based on the context provided, which is about the immune system. Let me start by recalling the key points about the immune system.

First, I need to make sure each question is unique and covers different aspects. Let me think of different areas: types of immune cells, roles of antibodies, parts of the immune system, how it responds to pathogens, differences between innate and adaptive, functions of lymph nodes, antigens, types of immunity, and maybe something about vaccines.

Wait, the user specified that the context is "Sistema_imunitário", so I need to make sure all the questions are within that scope. Let me list possible questions:

1. What are the two main types of immune responses?
2. What is the primary function of B cells?
3. Which part of the immune system is responsible for producing antibodies?
4. What is the role of the thymus gland?
5. What is the difference between innate and adaptive immunity?
6. What are antigens?
7. What is the function of lymph nodes?
8. What is the role of T cells?
9. What is passive immunity?
10. What is the primary role of the spleen?

Now, I need to check if these are all based on the provided context. The context is the immune system, so these are all relevant. Each question should have a clear, correct answer. Let me make sure each answer is either explicit or can be inferred from general knowledge about the immune system.

For example, the two main types are innate and adaptive. B cells produce antibodies, which is correct. The thymus develops T cells. Innate is immediate, adaptive is specific. Antigens are substances that trigger an immune response. Lymph nodes filter lymph and activate immune cells. T cells attack infected cells. Passive immunity is from antibodies, and the spleen filters blood.

I need to format each as "pergunta;resposta" without any extra text. Let me structure them in CSV format as requested, ensuring there are exactly 10 pairs. No markdown, just the CSV. Let me double-check that each question is unique and covers different aspects. Looks good. Now, write them out in the correct format.
