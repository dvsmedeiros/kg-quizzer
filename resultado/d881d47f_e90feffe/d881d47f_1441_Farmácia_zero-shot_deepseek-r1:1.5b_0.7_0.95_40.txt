Okay, I need to help the user generate 10 questions and answers based on a context provided about a prescription farm. Let me start by understanding what's given.

The context is about a prescription farm, which includes activities like farming, production, distribution, marketing, and customer service. The user wants exactly 10 pairs in CSV format with specific structure. I should focus only on the farm aspects without adding any extra information or adjectives.

First question: What are the primary activities of this farm? That's straightforward. It should be clear and directly related to the context.

Second question: How many employees does the farm employ? This is a quantifiable activity that ties into the farm itself, providing relevant data.

Third question: What is the main product offered by the farm? This addresses the primary output of farming operations, which are products like crops or livestock.

Fourth question: Who employs the farm's employees to harvest their produce? This links directly to the labor force and their role in producing food, making it a clear activity.

Fifth question: What is the weekly average number of hours worked by each employee during farming? It provides a specific metric about labor efficiency, which is useful for assessing productivity.

Sixth question: How many hours does each employee work per day? This breaks down the weekly time into daily figures, offering more granular data on labor commitment.

Seventh question: What's the average number of hours an employee works in a week? It aggregates the previous day's information, giving a broader view of daily productivity.

Eighth question: How many days does each employee work per week? This adds another layer of detail about the schedule and duration of employment.

Ninth question: What is the total weekly number of hours worked by all farm employees during farming season? It combines multiple factors to assess overall labor effort.

Tenth question: What is the average number of hours all farm employees work per day in the farming season? This provides a consistent daily productivity measure, useful for monitoring performance.

I need to ensure each answer is clear and directly related to the context provided without adding any extra fluff. Also, separating each question with a semicolon and ensuring the CSV format as specified.
