Okay, so I need to create 10 pairs of questions and answers based on the provided data about the Scottish Parliament. Let me first understand the structure of the data.

Looking at the data, it's a detailed description of the Scottish Parliament in RDF format. It includes information about its leaders, election dates, committees, location, and more. There are also some properties related to structure, voting systems, and committees.

I'll start by identifying key pieces of information that can form factual questions. For example, knowing when the last election was or who the leader is would be good starting points. Also, details about the parliamentary building and the voting system could make for informative Q&A pairs.

Let me list out some potential areas:
1. Election dates
2. Leadership roles
3. Location of the parliament
4. Voting system used
5. Structure (unicameral)
6. Committees or focus areas
7. The name or title of the parliament

Now, I'll formulate questions and answers based on these points.

First question: When was the last election for the Scottish Parliament? From the data, it says "2021-05-06", so that's straightforward.

Next, who leads the Scottish Parliament? The data mentions Alison Johnstone as a leader along with George Adam. I should mention both but clarify that Alison is the primary leader.

Location: It's in Edinburgh and Scotland. So, where is it located?

Voting system: Additional member system, which is commonly used for proportional representation.

Structure: It's unicameral, meaning it has only one chamber.

Committees: There are several listed, like Economy, Energy and Tourism, Education, etc. I can list a few to give an idea.

Name of the parliament: The official name given is "Scottish Parliament".

The presiding officer role: Mentioned as Presiding Officer with a link to more info.

Elections dates in 2021: There are two mentioned, May 13 and 20. I'll note both.

Parliament building: Located at the Scottish Parliament Building in Edinburgh.

I think these cover a good range of topics that would be helpful for someone looking to understand the basics about the Scottish Parliament.
