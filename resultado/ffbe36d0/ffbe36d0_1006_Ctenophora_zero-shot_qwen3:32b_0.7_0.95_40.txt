Okay, I need to create 10 question-answer pairs about Ctenophora based on the provided context. Let me start by recalling what I know about Ctenophores. They are marine invertebrates, often called comb jellies. Their name comes from the Greek words meaning "comb" and "hairs," referring to the cilia they use for movement. They are transparent and have a gelatinous body. 

First question: What is another common name for Ctenophores? Answer: Comb jellies. That's straightforward.

Second: What is the origin of the name Ctenophora? The name comes from Greek words for comb and hairs. The Greek for comb is 'kten' and for hair is 'phoros,' meaning bearing. So the answer would be from the Greek 'kten' (comb) and 'phoros' (bearing).

Third: What type of locomotion do Ctenophores use? They use cilia arranged in rows called comb rows. So the answer is cilia arranged in comb rows.

Fourth: What is the primary feature of Ctenophores' body structure? They have a gelatinous, transparent body. So the answer is gelatinous and transparent.

Fifth: Do Ctenophores have a centralized nervous system? I think they have a nerve net, which is a decentralized system. So the answer is no, they have a diffuse nerve net.

Sixth: What is the main component of their diet? They primarily feed on small plankton and other tiny organisms. So the answer is small plankton and other tiny marine organisms.

Seventh: Are Ctenophores found in all oceanic environments? They are mostly marine, found in all oceans, including deep seas. So yes, found in all oceanic environments.

Eighth: Do Ctenophores have a respiratory system? They rely on diffusion through their bodies, so no specialized respiratory system. Answer: No, they use body surface for gas exchange.

Ninth: What is the function of the comb rows in Ctenophores? The comb rows help in locomotion by moving through the water. So answer: Aid in movement through water.

Tenth: How do Ctenophores capture their prey? They have colloblasts, sticky cells that trap prey. So answer: Using colloblasts to adhere to prey.

Wait, I need to make sure each answer is either explicit or inferable from the context. Let me check again. For example, colloblasts might be a specific term, but if the context mentions they use sticky cells to capture prey, then that's okay. Also, verifying the nerve net vs. centralized nervous system. Yes, Ctenophores have a nerve net. Also, their body structure is indeed gelatinous and transparent. The Greek origin is correct. They do use cilia in comb rows. So I think these 10 questions cover different aspects: common names, etymology, locomotion, body structure, nervous system, diet, habitat, respiratory system, comb rows function, and prey capture method. That should be 10 unique questions without repetition. Let me count again. Yes, each is a different aspect. I think this meets the requirements.
