Okay, so I need to create 10 question-answer pairs based on the given context and facts about the Law of the European Union (LEU). Let me start by understanding what's provided.

First, the context explains that the EU's legal framework includes rules operational in member states since the establishment of the ECSC after WWII. It mentions promoting peace, values, and well-being, with political institutions, social, and economic policies beyond nation-states for cooperation and human development. The EU's judiciary sees it as a new international law order.

Looking at the facts section, there are RDF triples indicating relationships between resources. For example, Common Market Law Review is related to LEU as an academic discipline, Henry Schermers specializes in LEU, John Bell works on LEU, and Wikipedia pages link to DBpedia entries for LEU.

The examples provided show questions about definitions, sources of law, effects on member states, legislative organs, and other aspects. So I need to vary the questions across different facets of LEU without repetition.

Let me brainstorm possible question types:

1. Definition-based: What is the EU's legal framework?
2. Historical: When was it established?
3. Purpose: Why was it created?
4. Structure: What are its components?
5. Impact: How does it affect member states?
6. Governance: Who enforces or interprets it?
7. Legal sources: Primary vs secondary laws.
8. Scholars/experts: Who studies LEU?
9. Jurisdictional effects: Direct/indirect impact.
10. Comparison with other legal systems.

Now, I'll map these to the context and facts:

1. Definition: The EU's legal framework is a system of rules operational in member states since ECSC post-WWII, aiming for peace and well-being. So question about its objective or purpose.

2. Historical: Established after WWII with ECSC. But how specific can I be? Maybe when was the foundation?

Wait, context says "since the foundation...after WWII," but doesn't give a year. So maybe not a direct fact here.

3. Purpose: To promote peace, values, and well-being. That's clear in the first sentence.

4. Structure: Includes political institutions, social, economic policies beyond nation-states. So question about its structure or components.

5. Impact on member states: The legal rules operate within them for cooperation and development. Maybe effects on national laws?

6. Governance: Institutions like EU Parliament, Council, judiciary? Or who enforces the law?

7. Legal sources: Treaties as primary, regulations/directives as secondary. Mentioned in examples.

8. Scholars: Henry Schermers and John Bell are scholars in LEU. So question about notable experts or subdisciplines.

9. Jurisdictional effects: The legal framework can have direct or indirect effects on member states' laws. From the context, it's mentioned that EU law has an effect on national laws.

10. Comparison with other legal systems: It's a new order of international law, so maybe how is it different?

Now, considering the facts, Henry Schermers and John Bell are linked to LEU as academic disciplines or subdisciplines. So questions about scholars or their fields can be included.

Also, Common Market Law Review is an academic journal in this field, which could relate to sources of information but maybe not necessary for a question.

Now, let me structure the questions:

1. What is the primary objective of the EU's legal framework?
   - To promote peace, its values, and well-being.

2. When was the foundation of the precursor to the EU established?
   - After WWII with ECSC. But exact year? Maybe not necessary, just context.

3. Which scholars are known for their work in LEU?
   - Henry Schermers and John Bell.

4. What are the main components of the EU's legal framework beyond nation-states?
   - Political institutions, social, economic policies.

5. How does EU law affect national laws of member states?
   - Direct or indirect effects.

6. Name two scholars who specialize in LEU.
   - Henry Schermers and John Bell.

7. What is considered a new order in international law according to the EU's judiciary?
   - The EU represents it.

8. Which academic journal is related to LEU?
   - Common Market Law Review.

9. What are the main sources of primary law in the EU?
   - Treaties establishing the Union.

10. How does the EU contribute to human development?
    - Through cooperation and development policies beyond nation-states.

I think that's a good mix covering different aspects without repetition. Now, I'll structure them into 10 pairs, ensuring each has a unique angle.
