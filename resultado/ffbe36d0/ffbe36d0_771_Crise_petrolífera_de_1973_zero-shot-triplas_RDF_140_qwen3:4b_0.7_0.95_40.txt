Okay, the user wants me to generate 10 objective question-answer pairs based on the provided context about the 1973 oil crisis. Let me start by carefully reading the context and facts given.

First, the context mentions that the crisis began in October 1973 when OPEC members imposed an oil embargo on countries supporting Israel during the Yom Kippur War. The countries affected initially were Canada, Japan, the Netherlands, the UK, and the US, expanding later to Portugal, Rhodesia, and South Africa. The oil price rose from $3 to $12 per barrel, with even higher prices in the US. The crisis is called the "first oil shock," followed by the 1979 crisis as the "second oil shock."

Now, I need to create 10 varied questions that cover different aspects of this information. Let me list out possible angles: the start date, the reason for the embargo, the countries involved, the price increase, the name of the crisis, the impact, the duration, the organizations involved, the main conflict, and the economic effects.

I need to ensure each question is unique and directly relates to the content. Let me check for possible overlaps. For example, the embargo's reason is related to the Yom Kippur War and support for Israel. The countries affected are listed, so I can ask about them. The price change is a key point. The crisis is referred to as the first oil shock, so that's a fact. The duration from October 1973 to March 1974 is another detail. The OPEC is mentioned, so that's part of the organization involved. The conflict is the Arab-Israeli conflict, specifically the Yom Kippur War. The economic effects include the oil shock and its long-term impacts.

Wait, the user mentioned the "first oil shock" and the "second oil shock" in 1979. So that's another point. Also, the expansion of the embargo to other countries like Portugal and South Africa. I need to make sure each question is distinct. Let me count: start date, reason, countries initially affected, price increase, name of the crisis, duration, OPEC, conflict, expansion of embargo, economic effects, and the second oil shock.

That's 10 points. Now, I need to phrase each question in Portuguese, making sure the answers are correct and directly from the context. Let me check each fact again to avoid errors. For example, the embargo started in October 1973, the reason was support for Israel during the Yom Kippur War, the initial countries were the ones listed, the price went from $3 to $12, the first shock is the 1973 crisis, the second in 1979, the duration was until March 1974, OPEC is the organization, the conflict was Arab-Israeli, and the embargo expanded to other countries. The economic impact is the oil shock.

I think that covers all the points. Now, I need to structure each question and answer correctly. Make sure not to include any extra information or explanations. Just the question and the answer. Let me draft them now.
