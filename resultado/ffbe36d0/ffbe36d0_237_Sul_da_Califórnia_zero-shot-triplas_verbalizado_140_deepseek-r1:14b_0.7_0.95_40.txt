Okay, so I need to generate 10 pairs of questions and answers based on the provided context about Southern California. The user has given me a detailed set of facts, including geographical information, population data, and various entities associated with the region. My task is to create relevant and varied questions that cover different aspects of this content.

First, I'll go through the context and identify key points. The main facts include:

- Southern California's location and borders.
- Population figures from 2019 and 2020.
- Various companies, organizations, and individuals associated with Southern California.
- Geographical features like mountains, rivers, and roads.
- Natural events such as earthquakes and oil spills.
- Cultural aspects like music festivals and sports teams.

I need to make sure each question is unique and covers different topics. Let me start by brainstorming possible questions:

1. What is the approximate population of Southern California in 2019?
   - Answer: Around 23.8 million people.

2. Which US state shares a border with Southern California to the east?
   - Answer: Arizona.

3. What earthquake in 1987 affected Southern California?
   - Answer: The Whittier Narrows earthquake.

4. Name one of the sports teams based in Southern California.
   - Answer: USC Trojans men's rugby or Los Angeles Dodgers (but Dodgers are mentioned, so maybe better to use another team if possible).

Wait, looking back at the facts, I see "USC Trojans men's rugby pertence à região Southern California" which translates to USC Trojans men's rugby is part of Southern California. So that's a valid answer.

5. Which supermarket chain serves Southern California?
   - Answer: Pavilions or Ralphs.

6. What earthquake in 2008 affected Southern California?
   - Answer: The Chino Hills earthquake.

7. Name one of the counties in Southern California.
   - Answer: Los Angeles County, San Bernardino County, Orange County, etc.

8. Which ice cream company serves Southern California?
   - Answer: Fosselman's Ice Cream Company.

9. What is the name of a highway in Southern California mentioned?
   - Looking at the facts, I see "US 95 (1961 cutout).svg" and "I-215 (CA).svg", but perhaps more specific ones like Route 66 or others might be better, but based on given data, maybe mention one of the highways listed.

Wait, in the facts, there's "US 95 (1961 cutout).svg" and "I-215 (CA).svg", so perhaps a question about a highway in Southern California could refer to these. Alternatively, Route 66 passes through Southern California, but it's not explicitly mentioned here.

Alternatively, considering the mention of "I-8 (CA).svg", that could be a specific highway.

But maybe better to pick one from the facts provided.

Looking back, I see "Southern California possui geometria WGS84 POINT(-117 34)" which is about coordinates but not a highway. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps mention the Santa Monica Pier as an image, but that's more of a landmark.

Wait, another approach: What mountain range is in Southern California? The context mentions "San Gabriel Mountains", so that could be a question.

10. Name one singer or band with origins in Southern California.
    - Answer: The Beach Boys (not listed), but from the facts, maybe someone like Michael Shabaz or others mentioned, but perhaps better to refer to one explicitly listed.

Wait, in the facts, "Jill Barnett nasceu em Southern California" and other individuals. So perhaps asking about a person born there.

Alternatively, using the fact that "The Grilled Cheese Truck atende à região Southern California", which is a food truck.

Let me structure these questions properly:

1. What is the approximate population of Southern California as of 2019?
   - Answer: Approximately 23.8 million people.

2. Which US state forms the eastern border of Southern California?
   - Answer: Arizona.

3. Name one supermarket chain that serves Southern California.
   - Answer: Pavilions or Ralphs.

4. What earthquake in 1987 affected Southern California?
   - Answer: The Whittier Narrows earthquake.

5. Which sports team is based in Southern California?
   - Answer: USC Trojans men's rugby.

6. Name one singer who was born in Southern California.
   - Answer: Jill Barnett or Diane Michelle.

7. What is the name of a highway located in Southern California?
   - Answer: I-8 (CA) or Route 66 (though not explicitly mentioned, but I think it's acceptable).

Wait, checking the facts again, "US 95 (1961 cutout).svg" and "I-215 (CA).svg" are mentioned. So maybe better to refer to one of these.

8. Name a radio station located in Southern California.
   - Answer: KUSC or KPFK.

9. Which county is part of Southern California?
   - Answer: Los Angeles County, Orange County, etc.

10. What earthquake in 2008 affected Southern California?
    - Answer: The Chino Hills earthquake.

I think these cover a range of topics including population, geography, natural events, companies, sports, people, highways, radio stations, and other entities.
