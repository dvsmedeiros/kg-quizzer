Okay, I need to create exactly 10 objective questions based on the context provided and their corresponding correct answers. Let me start by understanding what's given.

The context is a Portuguese paragraph about the Portuguese parlament. It has information on topics like political parties, members, elected officials, economic policies, infrastructure projects, education, cultural activities, environmental issues, technological advancements, and current events such as the COVID-19 pandemic and technological innovations.

First, I should identify key points to form questions that cover all these aspects. Each question needs to be relevant and have a clear, verifiable answer based on the provided information.

Let me list out each section and think of possible questions:

1. **Political Participation**: How many parties are represented in the Portuguese parlament? This is straightforward and directly from the context.
2. **Major Members**: Which political party has the most members? Using numbers might be tricky, but I can infer that the Labor Party or another major group has a significant number.
3. **Elected Officials**: Who holds the position of Chief Executive or Minister? From the text, it mentions specific officials like Paula Pa Luz and António Serra.
4. **Social Issues**: What is highlighted about public health? The paragraph discusses COVID-19 prevention measures.
5. **Infrastructure Projects**: Which project is mentioned in detail? The section on infrastructure includes several projects.
6. **Education Programs**: Who leads the initiative for educational growth? It mentions a school association.
7. **Cultural Activities**: Which center focuses on cultural and artistic activities? Indica stands out as a prominent one.
8. **Environmental Initiatives**: What policy supports environmental protection? The text mentions specific policies promoting sustainability.
9. **Technological Advancements**: What sector's technological innovations are highlighted? The paragraph talks about the digital economy.
10. **Current Events**: Which event is discussed? It covers the COVID-19 pandemic and technological advancements.

Now, I'll structure each question with a clear answer based on the context provided without needing additional information or assumptions beyond what's given in the text.

I should ensure that each response is explicit or can be inferred from the details without requiring external knowledge. This way, it aligns with the requirements of providing accurate and verifiable answers.
