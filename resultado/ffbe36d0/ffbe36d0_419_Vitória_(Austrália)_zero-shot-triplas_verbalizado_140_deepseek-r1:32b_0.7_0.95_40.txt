Okay, so I need to generate 10 question and answer pairs based on the given context about Victoria, Australia. The user has provided a detailed background and some specific facts. Let me start by understanding what's required.

First, I should focus on key points from the context. Victoria is the smallest mainland state and the second most populous, with Melbourne as its capital. It was part of New South Wales before becoming a separate colony in 1851. The economy is diverse, and Melbourne is a major cultural hub with significant landmarks like the Melbourne Cricket Ground.

Looking at the facts section, there are various entities associated with Victoria—people born or died there, places located within the state, institutions headquartered there, etc. These can be great sources for questions.

I need to make sure each question is unique and covers different aspects. Let's brainstorm possible questions:

1. What is Victoria known as in English?
2. When did Victoria gain self-government?
3. Which river's mouth is in Victoria?
4. Where was Peter Nugent born?
5. What's the GDP per capita of Victoria?
6. Where is the Trafalgar High School located?
7. Who leads the Labor Party in Victoria?
8. Which lake is near Melbourne?
9. Where was James Ryan O'Neill educated?
10. What type of region is Victoria?

Wait, some of these might be too specific or not covered well in the context. Let me cross-check with the provided facts and context.

For example, the GDP per capita isn't explicitly mentioned, but I can infer it from the context about PIB per capita. Also, checking if all questions are answerable within the given data is crucial to avoid inaccuracies.

I'll structure each question to have a clear single correct answer based on the content. Ensuring variety in topics—geography, history, culture, education, economy—to cover different aspects of Victoria.

Now, I'll draft the 10 pairs, making sure they're varied and each answers a distinct aspect without repetition.
