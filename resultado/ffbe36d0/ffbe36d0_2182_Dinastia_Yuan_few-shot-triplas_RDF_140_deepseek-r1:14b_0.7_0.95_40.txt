Okay, I need to create exactly 10 pairs of questions and answers based on the provided context about the Yuan dynasty. The context is in Chinese, so I have to make sure I understand it correctly.

First, I'll read through the facts given. It starts with the dynasty's name in Mongolian, Chinese, and English, mentions Kublai Khan as the founder, and notes that it was established in 1271. Then there are a lot of RDF triples about various people, battles, places associated with the Yuan dynasty.

I should focus on extracting key information from these facts to form varied questions. The examples provided by the user can guide me on what types of questions to ask. For instance, they asked about names, origins, dates, and significant events.

Looking at the context more carefully, I see details about Kublai Khan's lineage, battles the Yuan dynasty was involved in, places where they established temples or provinces, notable figures associated with them, and their administrative details like currency and capitals. Also, there are mentions of when the dynasty began and ended.

I need to make sure each question is unique and covers different aspects of the dynasty. Let me brainstorm possible questions:

1. What was the name of Kublai Khan's grandfather?
2. Which Chinese dynasty preceded the Yuan?
3. When was the Yuan dynasty officially established?
4. Name one of the significant battles the Yuan participated in.
5. What religious practices were present during the Yuan period?
6. Where was the capital of the Yuan dynasty?
7. What was a notable structure built by the Yuan in Dadu?
8. Which Mongol leader founded the Yuan dynasty?
9. How long did the Yuan dynasty last approximately?
10. What event marked the end of the Yuan dynasty?

Wait, some of these might not be directly supported by the facts provided. For example, I don't see specific information about structures built in Dadu except that two lakes were built there.

I should cross-reference the facts to ensure accuracy. The context mentions that Kublai Khan is the founder, his grandfather was Genghis Khan, the dynasty started in 1271, ended in 1368, and had various religious practices as listed. Battles include the Battle of Yamen and the Mongol conquest of the Song.

I can structure questions around these points. I must avoid repeating similar questions from the examples provided by the user, like asking about Kublai Khan's role or the dynasty's name again.

Let me list out 10 unique questions based on this:

1. What is the Chinese name for the Yuan dynasty?
2. Who was the founder of the Yuan dynasty?
3. When was the Yuan dynasty officially established?
4. Which Chinese dynasty preceded the Yuan?
5. How long did the Yuan dynasty last approximately?
6. Name one significant battle associated with the Yuan dynasty.
7. What religious practices were prevalent during the Yuan period?
8. Where was the capital of the Yuan dynasty?
9. Who was Kublai Khan's grandfather?
10. What event marked the end of the Yuan dynasty?

I think these cover a good range, from names and dates to battles and cultural aspects.
