Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs based on the given data about Harvard University. Let me start by looking at the provided data and examples to understand what's needed.

First, the data includes various facts about Harvard, like its establishment, notable figures, organizations founded, and statistics about its libraries. The examples given are questions about historical events, notable people, and specific facts like the number of libraries or Nobel laureates.

I should make sure each question is clear and the answer is directly from the data. Let me check the data again for possible questions.

From the data:
- The university was founded in 1636.
- John Harvard is the namesake.
- The Harvard Library is the largest academic library system.
- It has 79 libraries with 18 million volumes.
- 8 U.S. presidents are alumni.
- 150 Nobel laureates are alumni.
- Charles W. Eliot transformed it into a research university.
- James Bryant Conant led during the Great Depression and WWII.
- The American Universities Association was founded in 1900.
- The university has a statue of John Harvard.

Now, I need to form questions that match these points. Let me think of different angles. For example, instead of just "When was it founded?" maybe "In which year was Harvard University established?" 

Also, check for any other details. The data mentions that the university has a depiction in Wikimedia, but that might not be useful for questions. The sameAs link to VIAF might not be relevant here.

Avoid repeating the same structure as the examples. For instance, the example about the largest library system can be phrased as "What is the largest academic library system in the world?" 

Let me list possible questions:

1. When was Harvard University founded?
2. Who is the university named after?
3. What is the largest academic library system in the world?
4. How many libraries are part of the Harvard Library system?
5. How many volumes are in Harvard's library?
6. How many U.S. presidents are alumni of Harvard?
7. How many Nobel laureates are among Harvard's alumni?
8. Who transformed Harvard into a modern research university?
9. Who was the leader during the Great Depression and WWII?
10. Which organization did Harvard found in 1900?

Now, check the answers against the data. The answers should be precise. For example, the answer to the founding year is 1636. The name is John Harvard. The library system is Harvard Library. The number of libraries is 79, volumes 18 million. Presidents: 8, Nobel laureates: 150. The president who transformed it was Charles W. Eliot. The leader during the mentioned periods was James Bryant Conant. The organization founded in 1900 is the American Universities Association.

Now, phrasing the questions to be distinct and clear. Avoid using the same wording as the examples. For instance, instead of "What organization Harvard found in 1900?" maybe "Which organization was established by Harvard in 1900?"

Let me put them together as 10 pairs.
