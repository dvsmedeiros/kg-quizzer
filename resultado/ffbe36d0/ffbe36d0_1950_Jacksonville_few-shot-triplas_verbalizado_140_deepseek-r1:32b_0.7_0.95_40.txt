Okay, so I need to help the user by generating 10 question-answer pairs based on the provided context about Jacksonville, Florida. Let me start by carefully reading and understanding the content.

First, I'll go through the context to identify key points that can form the basis of questions. The city's population rank in the U.S., its location relative to other cities like Miami and Georgia, historical facts like when it was founded, and notable events such as hosting the Super Bowl are all important details.

Looking at the facts section, there are mentions of various people born or died in Jacksonville, which can lead to questions about famous individuals from there. Also, structures like bridges and stadiums are mentioned, so those could be good topics for questions too.

I need to ensure each question is unique and covers different aspects of the content without repetition. I'll vary the types of questions—some might be about population stats, others about history or geography, and a few about notable events or people.

Let me list out possible questions:

1. Where is Jacksonville located in relation to Miami?
