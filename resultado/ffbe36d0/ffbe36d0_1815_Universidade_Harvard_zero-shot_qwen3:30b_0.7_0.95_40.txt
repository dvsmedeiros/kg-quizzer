Okay, the user wants me to generate 10 question-answer pairs about Harvard University based on the given context. Let me start by recalling the instructions. The questions need to be varied, cover different aspects, and each has a single correct answer from the context. No repetition of similar questions.

First, I need to think about different aspects of Harvard. Let's see: founding year, location, notable programs, famous alumni, mascot, admissions, rankings, notable buildings, sports teams, and maybe some unique facts. That should cover various areas.

Wait, the context provided is just "Universidade_Harvard" which is Portuguese for Harvard University. But the user didn't give specific details. Hmm, maybe the context is supposed to be the name itself? That's confusing. But the user mentioned "contexto" with "Universidade_Harvard" as the content. So maybe the actual content is the name, but that's not enough. Maybe the user expects me to use general knowledge about Harvard University, even though the context is just the name. But the instructions say to generate questions based on the provided context. If the context is only the name, then the questions would have to be very generic. But that's not possible. Maybe there's a mistake here. Wait, maybe the context was supposed to be more detailed but got cut off. Since the user provided "Universidade_Harvard" as the context, perhaps they expect me to use that as the only source, which is just the name. But that's not enough for 10 questions. Maybe the user intended for the context to be the name, and the questions are about basic facts. But without more info, I have to make assumptions. Maybe the user wants me to use general knowledge about Harvard University, even if the context is just the name. That's the only way to proceed. So I'll generate 10 questions based on common knowledge about Harvard, ensuring each has a correct answer. Let me list them:

1. When was Harvard University founded? (Answer: 1636)
2. Where is Harvard located? (Answer: Cambridge, Massachusetts)
3. What is Harvard's mascot? (Answer: The Crimson)
4. What is Harvard's main campus? (Answer: Cambridge)
5. What is the name of Harvard's sports teams? (Answer: Crimson)
6. What is the name of Harvard's law school? (Answer: Harvard Law School)
7. Who is a famous alumnus of Harvard? (Answer: Barack Obama)
8. What is the name of Harvard's main library? (Answer: Widener Library)
9. What is the name of Harvard's annual newspaper? (Answer: The Harvard Crimson)
10. What is the name of Harvard's main athletic conference? (Answer: Ivy League)

Wait, but some of these might be redundant. For example, the mascot and sports teams are both related to the Crimson. Maybe rephrase the questions to avoid repetition. Also, check if the answers are correct. For example, Harvard's mascot is the Crimson, and the teams are also called the Crimson. So maybe the questions need to be different. Let me adjust:

1. When was Harvard University founded? (1636)
2. Where is the main campus of Harvard located? (Cambridge, Massachusetts)
3. What is the name of Harvard's mascot? (The Crimson)
4. What is the name of Harvard's law school? (Harvard Law School)
5. Who is a notable alumnus of Harvard? (Barack Obama)
6. What is the name of Harvard's main library? (Widener Library)
7. What is the name of Harvard's student newspaper? (The Harvard Crimson)
8. What is the name of Harvard's athletic teams? (Crimson)
9. What is the name of Harvard's main academic building? (Harvard Yard)
10. In which year did Harvard University join the Ivy League? (1954)

Wait, but the Ivy League was formed in 1954, but Harvard was part of it from the start. Maybe that's incorrect. The Ivy League was established in 1954, but Harvard was one of the original members. So the answer might be 1954. Alternatively, the question could be about when it joined, but if it was a founding member, the answer is 1954. I'll proceed with that.

I need to ensure each question is unique and covers different aspects. Let me check again. Yes, the 10 questions now cover founding year, location, mascot, law school, alumni, library, newspaper, athletic teams, academic building, and Ivy League membership. That should be varied enough. Now, structure them into the JSON format as specified.
