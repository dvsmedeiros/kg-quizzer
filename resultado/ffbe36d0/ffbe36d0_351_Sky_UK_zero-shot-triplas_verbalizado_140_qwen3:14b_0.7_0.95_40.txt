Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs based on the provided context and facts. Let me start by carefully reading through the context and facts to identify the key points and details that can be turned into questions.

First, the context mentions that British Satellite Broadcasting (BSB) was a company based in London that started transmitting in March 1990 and was incorporated in November 1990 to form BSkyB. The facts include various details like the founding date (1986), locations (London, England, United Kingdom, Marco Polo House), mergers (with Sky Television to form BSkyB), associated TV channels (The Movie Channel, The Power Station, Galaxy), films produced (Memphis Belle, Hardware), models used in Wikipedia pages, categories, and other company types.

Now, I need to create questions that cover different aspects without repeating. Let me list possible topics:

1. Founding date of BSB.
2. Incorporation date leading to BSkyB.
3. Location (Marco Polo House, London, England).
4. Merged with Sky Television.
5. TV channels owned by BSB.
6. Films produced by BSB.
7. Wikipedia models used.
8. Categories associated.
9. Successor company (Sky UK).
10. Image representative files.

Wait, the context says "incorporada pela em novembro de 1990" which might be a typo. Maybe it's "incorporada pela BSkyB em novembro de 1990" as per the facts. The facts mention "Merged with Sky Television plc to form BSkyB" so that's the incorporation date.

For locations, the facts mention "localizado em London", "England", "United Kingdom", and "Marco Polo House". So questions can be about where it was based, specific addresses, etc.

TV channels: The Movie Channel, The Power Station, Galaxy, Now, etc.

Films: Memphis Belle, Hardware, Heil Honey I'm Home! (wait, that's a TV channel or a film? The fact says "Heil Honey I'm Home! é uma empresa do tipo British Satellite Broadcasting" which might be a mistake. Wait, no, looking back, the facts say "Heil Honey I'm Home! é uma empresa do tipo British Satellite Broadcasting". That seems odd. Maybe it's a typo, perhaps "Heil Honey I'm Home! é uma emissora do tipo British Satellite Broadcasting" or a TV channel. Alternatively, it might be a film, but the fact says "produzido por British Satellite Broadcasting" for Memphis Belle and Hardware. So maybe Heil Honey I'm Home! is a TV channel or another entity. Maybe it's a mistake in the facts, but I should take them as given.

Models used in Wikipedia: Template:Cite web, Template:Authority control, etc.

Categories: 1990 mergers and acquisitions, 1990s in British television, etc.

Successor: Sky UK.

Image files: Squarial2.jpg, Marco Polo House (brighter cropped version).jpg, British Satellite Broadcasting logo.png, BSBDishes.jpg.

Now, to form 10 unique questions. Let me list them:

1. Quando foi fundada a British Satellite Broadcasting?
   Resposta: 1986-12-11

2. Em que ano a British Satellite Broadcasting foi incorporada para formar a BSkyB?
   Resposta: 1990

3. Onde a British Satellite Broadcasting estava localizada?
   Resposta: London

4. Qual foi a empresa com a qual a British Satellite Broadcasting se fundiu para formar a BSkyB?
   Resposta: Sky Television plc

5. Quais são alguns canais de TV que a British Satellite Broadcasting possuía?
   Resposta: The Movie Channel, The Power Station, Galaxy

6. Quais filmes foram produzidos pela British Satellite Broadcasting?
   Resposta: Memphis Belle, Hardware

7. Quais modelos de página wiki são usados pela British Satellite Broadcasting?
   Resposta: Template:Cite web, Template:Authority control, Template:Reflist, Template:ISBN, Template:BSkyB, Template:Use dmy dates, Template:Use British English, Template:Infobox company, Template:Original UK satellite channels

8. Quais categorias estão associadas à British Satellite Broadcasting?
   Resposta: Category:1990 mergers and acquisitions, Category:1990s in British television, Category:1980s in the United Kingdom, Category:Mass media companies established in 1986, Category:British companies disestablished in 1990, Category:History of television in the United Kingdom

9. Qual empresa sucedeu a British Satellite Broadcasting?
   Resposta: Sky UK

10. Quais são os arquivos de imagem representativos da British Satellite Broadcasting?
    Resposta: Squarial2.jpg, Marco Polo House (brighter cropped version).jpg, British Satellite Broadcasting logo.png, BSBDishes.jpg

Now, I need to check if these questions are varied and cover different aspects, and that the answers are correctly derived from the facts. Also, ensure no repetition. The first two questions are about founding and incorporation date, then location, merger, TV channels, films, models, categories, successor, and image files. That seems to cover different aspects. Each answer is unique and based on the provided facts. The list of models might be too long, but the facts list several, so including some is okay. The categories are also listed in the facts. I think this meets the requirements.
