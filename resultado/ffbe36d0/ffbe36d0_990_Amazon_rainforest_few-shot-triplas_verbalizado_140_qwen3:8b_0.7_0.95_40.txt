Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs based on the provided context and facts about the Amazon rainforest. Let me start by reading through the context and facts carefully to understand the key points.

First, the context mentions that the Amazon covers 7 million km², with 5.5 million being tropical forest. It spans nine countries, with Brazil having 60%, Peru 13%, and others like Colombia, Venezuela, etc. The Amazon is a major biome, part of Brazil's "Amazônia Legal," and has areas designated as UNESCO World Heritage Sites. It's also considered one of the New Seven Wonders of Nature.

Looking at the facts, there are various images, categories, and other data. For example, the Amazon is associated with certain languages, has specific coordinates, and some notable people like Guillermo Cervantes and Maria Koepcke who died there. There are also mentions of deforestation, protected areas, and different ecoregions.

Now, I need to create 10 varied questions. Let me brainstorm possible angles:

1. Countries involved (number and names)
2. Area covered in Brazil
3. UNESCO designation
4. Notable people who died there
5. Biodiversity (species count)
6. Deforestation images or data
7. Protected area status
8. Ecoregions mentioned
9. Coordinates of the Amazon
10. Languages associated with the region

Wait, the examples given in the user's message included questions about the name in English, area covered, number of nations, etc. I need to ensure the questions are varied and not repetitive. Let me check the context again for specific details.

The context says the Amazon is the largest tropical forest, has the most biodiversity, and is part of the Amazon basin. The facts mention specific images related to deforestation, wildfires, and indigenous territories. Also, the Amazon is part of the New Seven Wonders of Nature.

Let me structure the questions:

1. How many countries are part of the Amazon region?
2. What is the percentage of the Amazon in Brazil?
3. Which UNESCO site is part of the Amazon?
4. Who are notable individuals who died in the Amazon?
5. What is the estimated number of tree species in the Amazon?
6. What is the significance of the Amazon in terms of biodiversity?
7. Which specific image or event is associated with deforestation in the Amazon?
8. What is the status of the Amazon as a protected area?
9. What are the coordinates of the Amazon?
10. What languages are native to the Amazon region?

Wait, but the examples had some answers like "more than half" for the percentage of tropical forests. Let me make sure the answers are accurate based on the context. For instance, the context says the Amazon represents more than half of the remaining tropical forests. The area covered in Brazil is 60% of the total area. The UNESCO site is the area mentioned in the context, which is the one designated as a World Heritage Site. The notable people are Guillermo Cervantes and Maria Koepcke. The deforestation images include specific ones like DeforestationinBrazil2.jpg or Wildfires in Brazil's indigenous territory, 2017. The protected area status is mentioned as being part of UNESCO. The coordinates are -3.0 -60.0. The languages include Portuguese (pt) and Spanish (es) as native languages.

I need to ensure each question is unique and answers are directly from the context or facts. Let me check each point again to avoid repetition. Also, the examples had some answers with specific numbers, so I should follow that. For example, the number of tree species was 16,000 in the examples, but I need to verify if that's in the context or facts. Wait, the examples had "16.000" as the answer, but the actual context or facts might not mention that. Wait, the facts do have "Amazon rainforest possui imagem representativa Climate change disturbances of rainforests infographic.jpg" but no specific number. Hmm, maybe I need to adjust. Let me focus on the context provided.

Another angle: the Amazon is the largest tropical forest, covers 7 million km², has the most biodiversity, is a UNESCO site, has specific images related to deforestation, and is part of the New Seven Wonders. Also, the native languages include Portuguese and Spanish.

So, the questions could be:

1. How many countries are part of the Amazon region?
   Answer: Nine countries.

2. What percentage of the Amazon is located in Brazil?
   Answer: 60%.

3. Which UNESCO site is part of the Amazon?
   Answer: The area designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

4. Who are notable individuals who died in the Amazon?
   Answer: Guillermo Cervantes and Maria Koepcke.

5. What is the significance of the Amazon in terms of biodiversity?
   Answer: It has the most biodiversity of any tropical forest.

6. What image or event is associated with deforestation in the Amazon?
   Answer: Deforestation in the Maranhão state of Brazil, 2016.

7. What is the status of the Amazon as a protected area?
   Answer: It includes areas designated as UNESCO World Heritage Sites.

8. What are the coordinates of the Amazon?
   Answer: -3.0 -60.0.

9. What languages are native to the Amazon region?
   Answer: Portuguese (pt) and Spanish (es).

10. What is the Amazon's status in the New Seven Wonders of Nature?
    Answer: It was nominated as one of the New Seven Wonders of Nature.

Wait, but the facts mention "Amazon rainforest usa modelo de página wiki Template:New7Wonders of Nature" which indicates it's associated with that. So the answer would be that it's part of the New Seven Wonders of Nature.

I need to ensure all answers are correctly extracted from the context and facts. Let me verify each point again.
