Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs based on the given context and facts about the 1973 oil crisis. Let me start by reading through the context carefully. The context mentions that the crisis began in October 1973 with an oil embargo by OPEC countries, targeting nations supporting Israel during the Yom Kippur War. The embargo expanded over time, leading to a significant increase in oil prices, causing economic and political impacts, and it's referred to as the first oil shock, followed by the 1979 crisis.

Now, looking at the facts provided, there are a lot of technical terms and categories, but I need to focus on the actual content. The facts include things like the embargo targets, the price increase from $3 to $12 per barrel, the effects on the global economy, and the subsequent crises. However, many of the facts are about the structure of the Wikipedia page, like templates used, categories, images, etc. But the user specified that the questions should be based on the context and facts provided, so I need to make sure I don't use the technical facts (like templates or images) unless they are relevant.

Wait, the user's instruction says: "Gerar pares de perguntas e respostas relevantes e corretas, exclusivamente a partir do conteúdo fornecido." So I have to use the context and facts provided. However, the facts listed include a lot of technical data about the Wikipedia page, like "1973 oil crisis é do tipo WikicatEmbargoes" or "1973 oil crisis possui imagem representativa No gas 1974.gif". But the context is about the actual historical event. So I need to focus on the context provided, not the technical facts. The user might have included those facts as part of the input, but the actual content is the context.

Therefore, the questions should be based on the context, not the technical facts. So I should ignore the facts that are about the Wikipedia structure and focus on the historical information given in the context. For example, the embargo was directed against countries supporting Israel, the price increase, the effects, the names of the crises, etc.

Now, I need to create 10 varied questions. Let me brainstorm possible questions:

1. What triggered the 1973 oil crisis?
   - Answer: The OPEC embargo against countries supporting Israel during the Yom Kippur War.

2. Which countries were initially targeted by the OPEC embargo?
   - Answer: Canada, Japan, Netherlands, UK, and the US.

3. How did the oil price change during the crisis?
   - Answer: It increased from $3 to around $12 per barrel.

4. What was the name given to the 1973 crisis?
   - Answer: The first oil shock.

5. Which subsequent crisis followed the 1973 crisis?
   - Answer: The 1979 crisis, known as the second oil shock.

6. Which countries were later included in the embargo?
   - Answer: Portugal, Rhodesia, and South Africa.

7. What were some of the effects of the crisis?
   - Answer: Economic and political impacts globally, leading to inflation and energy issues.

8. When did the embargo end?
   - Answer: In March 1974.

9. What was the impact on the US oil prices?
   - Answer: Prices were even higher than the global average.

10. What is the significance of the 1973 oil crisis in history?
    - Answer: It marked the first major oil shock, leading to long-term economic changes.

Wait, I need to make sure each question is unique and covers different aspects. Let me check for repetition. Also, the answers must be directly from the context. For example, the answer to question 1 should be "the OPEC embargo against countries supporting Israel during the Yom Kippur War" as per the context. The context also mentions that the embargo was declared by OPAEP (which is OPEC in Portuguese), so I should use the correct name. Wait, the context says "Organização dos Países Árabes Exportadores de Petróleo (OPAEP)" which is OPEC. So in Portuguese, the answer should mention OPEP.

Let me adjust the questions and answers accordingly. Also, check for exact wording from the context.

Another possible question: What was the main cause of the 1973 oil crisis? Answer: The OPEC embargo against countries supporting Israel during the Yom Kippur War.

Another: Which event led to the OPEC embargo? Answer: The Yom Kippur War.

But the context says the embargo was directed against countries seen as supporters of Israel during the war. So maybe rephrase.

I need to ensure that the answers are directly from the context. Let me go through the context again:

- The crisis began in October 1973 when OPAEP members declared an embargo.
- The embargo was directed at nations seen as supporters of Israel during the Yom Kippur War.
- Targeted countries: Canada, Japan, Netherlands, UK, US, later expanding to Portugal, Rhodesia, South Africa.
- Prices went from $3 to $12 per barrel.
- The embargo ended in March 1974.
- The crisis is called the first oil shock, followed by the 1979 crisis (second oil shock).

So, possible questions:

1. When did the 1973 oil crisis begin?
   Answer: October 1973.

2. Which organization declared the oil embargo?
   Answer: OPAEP (OPEC in Portuguese).

3. What was the primary reason for the OPEC embargo?
   Answer: To target nations supporting Israel during the Yom Kippur War.

4. Which countries were initially affected by the embargo?
   Answer: Canada, Japan, Netherlands, UK, and the US.

5. How did the oil price change during the crisis?
   Answer: It increased from $3 to around $12 per barrel.

6. When did the embargo end?
   Answer: March 1974.

7. What was the name given to the 1973 crisis?
   Answer: The first oil shock.

8. Which subsequent crisis followed the 1973 crisis?
   Answer: The 1979 crisis, known as the second oil shock.

9. Which countries were added to the embargo later?
   Answer: Portugal, Rhodesia, and South Africa.

10. What was one of the major consequences of the crisis?
    Answer: It caused a global economic and political crisis, leading to inflation and energy issues.

I need to make sure the answers are exact. For example, the answer to question 2 should be "Organização dos Países Árabes Exportadores de Petróleo (OPAEP)" but since the user wants the answer in Portuguese, maybe just "OPAEP" as per the context. However, the user might prefer the full name. Let me check the context: "Organização dos Países Árabes Exportadores de Petróleo (OPAEP)" so the answer should include both the full name and the acronym.

But the user might prefer the answer to be concise. Let me check the instructions again: "resposta correta" which should be explicit or inferable from the content. The context says "OPAEP" is the acronym, so the answer should be "OPAEP" or "Organização dos Países Árabes Exportadores de Petróleo (OPAEP)". However, since the question is in Portuguese, the answer should be in Portuguese. So "Organização dos Países Árabes Exportadores de Petróleo (OPAEP)".

But maybe the answer can be "OPEC" as well, since OPEC is the English name. However, the context uses the Portuguese name. To be accurate, I should use the name as given in the context.

So, for question 2: Answer: Organização dos Países Árabes Exportadores de Petróleo (OPAEP).

Another point: The context mentions "OPEP" in the facts, but the user's context says "OPAEP". So I need to use the correct Portuguese name.

I need to ensure all answers are precise. Let me finalize the 10 pairs.
