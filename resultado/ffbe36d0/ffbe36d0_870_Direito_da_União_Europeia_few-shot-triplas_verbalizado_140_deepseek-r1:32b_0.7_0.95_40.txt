Okay, so I need to create 10 question and answer pairs based on the given context and facts about European Union Law. Let me start by understanding what's provided.

The context talks about EU laws being a system of rules in member states, starting with the European Coal and Steel Community after WWII. The main goal is peace, values, and well-being. It mentions political institutions, social, and economic policies beyond nation-states for cooperation and human development. The EU's Court of Justice sees it as a new international legal order.

The facts list several points: "Law of the European Union" has its own topic, Common Market Law Review is involved in this field, John Bell (a legal scholar) works here, Henry G. Schermers is a subdiscipline under it, and some template usages which don't seem relevant for Q&A.

Looking at the examples provided, they cover definitions, sources of law, effects on member states' laws, legislative organs, etc. So I need to make sure my questions are varied but still within these topics.

First, a question about what EU Law is. Then maybe one about its origins or founding. The institutions involved could be another topic. I should also include the scholars mentioned and their contributions. Since the examples didn't touch on templates, I can skip those.

I need to ensure each question has only one correct answer from the context or facts, and avoid repeating similar questions. Let me try listing possible questions:

1. What is the main objective of the EU?
2. When was the EU's predecessor established?
3. Which scholars are associated with EU Law?
4. Name a journal that covers EU Law.
5. How does EU law affect national laws?
6. What institutions work together in EU legislation?
7. What kind of order does the EU represent according to its court?
8. What were the initial sectors of the EU's first community?
9. Who are prominent legal scholars in this field?
10. Which areas do these scholars focus on?

Now, checking each against the context and facts:

1. Objective: peace, values, well-being.
2. After WWII, so mid-40s. The exact year might be 1951 for ECSC.
3. John Bell and Henry G. Schermers are mentioned.
4. Common Market Law Review is a journal.
5. From context: direct or indirect effect.
6. Institutions like European Parliament and Council.
7. New international legal order.
8. Coal and steel sectors.
9. Same as question 3, but phrased differently.
10. EU law areas.

I need to make sure each answer is directly from the provided info without adding extra details. Also, vary the structure of questions so they're not too similar. Let me draft them:

1. What is the main objective of the European Union?
   - To promote peace, its values, and well-being.

2. When was the predecessor organization of the EU established?
   - After WWII (maybe specify year if possible, but context says 'after', so just that).

3. Which legal scholars are associated with the Law of the European Union?
   - John Bell and Henry G. Schermers.

4. What journal is involved in the field of EU Law?
   - Common Market Law Review.

5. How does EU law affect national laws of member states?
   - Direct or indirect effect.

6. Which two institutions are part of the EU's legislative process?
   - European Parliament and Council.

7. According to the EU Court, what kind of legal order is the EU?
   - New international legal order.

8. What were the initial sectors covered by the EU's first community?
   - Coal and steel.

9. Who contributes academically to EU Law?
   - John Bell and Henry G. Schermers.

10. In which areas do these scholars specialize?
    - European Union law.

I think that covers different aspects without repetition. Now, phrasing them as questions with single correct answers.
