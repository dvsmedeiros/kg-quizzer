Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs based on the given context and facts. Let me start by reading through the provided information carefully.

First, the context says that British Satellite Broadcasting (BSB) was a company based in London that provided satellite TV services in the UK. It was incorporated in November 1990 to form British Sky Broadcasting (BSkyB). They started broadcasting on March 25, 1990. 

The facts are in RDF format, which might be a bit tricky, but I can parse the key points. For example, there are entries about ownership of TV channels like Galaxy, Hardware (film), Heil Honey I'm Home!, Memphis Belle, Now, The Computer Channel, The Power Station, etc. Also, BSB's founding date is 1986-12-11, and it merged with Sky Television to form BSkyB. The successor is Sky UK. Locations include London and England. 

Now, I need to create questions that cover different aspects. Let me brainstorm possible questions:

1. When was BSB incorporated into BSkyB? Answer: November 1990.
2. What was BSB's founding date? Answer: December 11, 1986.
3. When did BSB start broadcasting? Answer: March 25, 1990.
4. What is the successor of BSB? Answer: Sky UK.
5. Which TV channels were owned by BSB? Answers could include Galaxy, Now, The Computer Channel, etc.
6. What is the headquarters location of BSB? Answer: London.
7. What category of companies does BSB belong to? Answer: Media companies in the UK.
8. What films were produced by BSB? Answers: Hardware, Memphis Belle.
9. What is the legal classification of BSB? Answers: Company, Organisation, etc.
10. What is the name of BSB's headquarters? Answer: Marco Polo House.

Wait, I need to ensure each question is unique and covers different aspects. Let me check the facts again. The context mentions specific channels and films. Also, the founding year is 1986, and the merger in 1990. Locations include London and England. The successor is Sky UK. The categories include things like "WikicatMediaCompaniesOfTheUnitedKingdom".

I need to make sure the answers are directly from the context. For example, the question about the successor should be Sky UK. The founding date is 1986-12-11. The start of broadcasting is March 25, 1990. The locations are London and England. The merged company is BSkyB. The channels owned include Galaxy, Now, The Computer Channel, The Power Station, etc. The films are Hardware, Memphis Belle. The company's name is British Satellite Broadcasting plc. The categories include things like "Company", "Organization", etc.

I need to avoid repeating similar questions. Let me list out 10 distinct ones:

1. When was British Satellite Broadcasting incorporated into British Sky Broadcasting?
2. What was the founding date of British Satellite Broadcasting?
3. On what date did British Satellite Broadcasting start its broadcasting operations?
4. What is the successor company of British Satellite Broadcasting?
5. Which TV channels were owned by British Satellite Broadcasting?
6. In which city was the headquarters of British Satellite Broadcasting located?
7. What type of company was British Satellite Broadcasting classified as?
8. Which films were produced by British Satellite Broadcasting?
9. What is the full legal name of British Satellite Broadcasting?
10. What is the location of the headquarters of British Satellite Broadcasting?

Now, check if the answers are in the context. For example, the successor is Sky UK. The founding date is 1986-12-11. The start date is March 25, 1990. The headquarters is London, and the specific address is Marco Polo House. The company's full name is "British Satellite Broadcasting plc". The channels include Galaxy, Now, The Computer Channel, The Power Station, etc. The films are Hardware and Memphis Belle. The classifications include Company, Organisation, etc.

I need to make sure the answers are accurate and directly from the given data. Let me structure each pair now.
