Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs based on the provided context about British Satellite Broadcasting (BSB). Let me start by understanding the context thoroughly. 

First, the context mentions that BSB was a TV company based in London, providing direct satellite TV services to the UK. It was incorporated in November 1990 to form BSkyB. They started transmitting on March 25, 1990. Also, there are some RDF triples that mention BSB's ownership of various TV channels and films, along with its merger with Sky Television to form BSkyB. The facts include its founding date as December 11, 1986, location in London and England, and its successor being Sky UK. 

Now, the user wants 10 pairs, each with a question and a correct answer. The questions must be varied and cover different aspects of the content. Let me list out the key points from the context:

1. BSB was incorporated in November 1990 to form BSkyB.
2. Started transmitting on March 25, 1990.
3. Founded in 1986, December 11.
4. Located in London, England, and Marco Polo House.
5. Merged with Sky Television to form BSkyB.
6. Owns several TV channels like Galaxy, Now, The Movie Channel, etc.
7. Successor is Sky UK.
8. Classified as a company, organization, etc.
9. Has various RDF properties and relations.
10. Has depictions like logos and images.

I need to make sure each question is unique and covers different aspects. Let me think of possible questions:

- When was BSB founded? (Answer: 1986)
- What was the successor company after BSB's merger? (Answer: Sky UK)
- Which company was formed by merging BSB with Sky Television? (Answer: BSkyB)
- What was the start date of BSB's transmissions? (Answer: March 25, 1990)
- Where was BSB based? (Answer: London)
- What was the name of the company after the merger? (Answer: BSkyB)
- Which TV channels were owned by BSB? (Answer: Galaxy, Now, The Movie Channel, etc.)
- What was the founding date of BSB? (Answer: December 11, 1986)
- What was the location of BSB's headquarters? (Answer: London)
- What was the name of the successor company? (Answer: Sky UK)

Wait, some of these might be duplicates. For example, the merger and the successor are related. Let me check the examples provided in the user's message. The examples include questions about the merger forming BSkyB, the successor being Sky UK, and others. I need to ensure that the questions are varied and not repeating the same points.

Another angle could be the RDF properties, but the user might not want that. The main focus is on the company's history, ownership, and key facts. Let me structure the questions to cover founding, merger, start date, locations, owned channels, successor, and any other unique points like the founder's date.

Let me draft the questions and answers, making sure each is distinct and based on the context. Also, check that the answers are explicitly mentioned or can be inferred. Avoid any questions that are too vague. For example, the answer to the successor company is Sky UK, which is mentioned in the facts. The founding date is December 11, 1986. The start date of transmissions is March 25, 1990. The merger formed BSkyB. Locations include London and England. Owned channels are listed in the RDF triples. The company's name after merger is BSkyB. The successor is Sky UK. The location of the headquarters is Marco Polo House in London. 

Wait, the context mentions Marco Polo House as a location. So another question could be about the headquarters. Also, the company's name is British Satellite Broadcasting plc. But the user's examples have questions about BSkyB and its successor. 

Let me compile the 10 pairs now, ensuring variety and correctness.
