Okay, so I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs based on the given context and facts about British Satellite Broadcasting (BSB). Let me start by understanding what information is provided.

First, BSB was a TV company in London that transmitted via satellite to the UK. It was formed in November 1990 with Sky Television to become BSkyB. They started broadcasting on March 25, 1990. 

Looking at the facts, there are details about their inception, location, ownership of various channels like The Movie Channel and Galaxy, and that they were involved in producing films such as Hardware and Memphis Belle. Also, they merged with Sky Television to form BSkyB.

I need to create varied questions covering different aspects: founding date, merger, start of broadcasts, ownership, film production, location, company type, dissolution year, acquisition category, and successor.

Each question should have a clear correct answer from the context without being repetitive. I'll make sure each question is unique and covers different areas like dates, companies, channels, films, locations, etc.
