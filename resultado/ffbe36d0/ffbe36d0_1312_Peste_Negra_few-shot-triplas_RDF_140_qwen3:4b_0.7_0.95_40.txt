Okay, I need to generate 10 objective question-answer pairs based on the provided context about the Black Death. Let me start by carefully reading through the context and facts given.

First, the Black Death is described as the most devastating pandemic in human history, killing 75-200 million people in Eurasia, peaking in Europe between 1347-1351. The cause is Yersinia pestis, leading to bubonic, pneumonic, and septicemic plague. It was the first major European plague outbreak and the second pandemic. It caused religious, social, and economic upheavals, deeply affecting European history. Originated in Central or Eastern Asia, spreading via the Silk Road to Crimea by 1343, then transported by fleas on Genoese merchant ships to the Mediterranean, reaching Europe through the Italian Peninsula. Estimated to have killed 30-60% of Europe's population. World population dropped from 475 million to 350-375 million in the 14th century. Europe took 200 years to recover, with some areas like Florence recovering only in the 19th century. The plague returned as outbreaks until the early 20th century.

Now, I need to create 10 distinct questions covering different aspects. Let's list possible topics: origin, cause, spread, impact on Europe, population loss, transmission method, historical effects, recovery time, and the role of fleas.

Looking at the examples provided, they include questions about origin, spread via ships, percentage of population killed, recovery time, duration, and other related facts. I need to ensure each question is unique and based on the given facts.

Check the facts again. The origin is Central or Eastern Asia. Spread via Silk Road to Crimea, then by fleas on Genoese ships. The main cause is Yersinia pestis. The plague caused 30-60% death in Europe. World population dropped from 475M to 350-375M. Europe took 200 years to recover, some regions took longer. The plague had a significant impact on society, economy, religion. The transmission via fleas on rats. The plague returned as outbreaks until early 20th century.

Now, formulating the questions:

1. Origin of the Black Death.
2. How it spread to the Mediterranean and Europe.
3. Percentage of Europe's population killed.
4. When the world population recovered from the Black Death.
5. How long did the plague last.
6. What was the main cause of the Black Death.
7. Transmission method via fleas on what?
8. Impact on Europe's recovery time.
9. Role of the Silk Road in the spread.
10. The role of Genoese merchant ships in spreading the plague.

Wait, the examples have some questions that might be similar. Let me ensure they are distinct. Also, check if the answer is in the facts. For example, the origin is Central or Eastern Asia. The spread via Genoese ships. The main cause is Yersinia pestis. The percentage is 30-60%. World population recovery time is not directly mentioned, but the example says "século XVII" (17th century), but according to the context, it took 200 years from the 14th century, so 17th century is correct. The duration is until early 20th century.

I need to make sure each answer is directly from the text. Avoid any incorrect info. For example, the example had a question about when the world population recovered, but the context says Europe took 200 years, but the world population recovery is not explicitly stated. However, the example says "século XVII" which might be a mistake. Wait, the context says that Europe took 200 years to recover, so if the plague started in the 14th century, the recovery would be in the 16th or 17th century. So the answer "século XVII" is correct.

Another point: the example had a question about the origin of all plagues, but the context says the Black Death originated in Asia, not necessarily all plagues. So that example might be incorrect, but the user's examples are for illustration, so I need to follow the given facts.

So, the 10 questions should be:

1. De onde se originou a morte negra?
2. Como a morte negra chegou ao Mediterrâneo e à Europa?
3. Quanto da população europeia matou a morte negra?
4. Quando a população mundial finalmente se recuperou da morte negra?
5. Por quanto tempo a praga permaneceu?
6. O que foi a principal causa da morte negra?
7. Como a praga se espalhou?
8. Quanto tempo a Europa demorou para se recuperar?
9. Qual o papel da Rota da Seda na propagação?
10. Qual o papel dos navios mercantes gênosos na propagação?

But need to check if these are all covered in the facts. Let me verify each one:

1. Origin: Central or Eastern Asia. Correct.
2. Spread to Mediterranean and Europe: via Genoese ships. Correct.
3. Percentage of Europe's population: 30-60%. Correct.
4. World population recovery: The context says Europe took 200 years, but the example says "século XVII". However, the context doesnity explicitly mention the world's recovery time, but the example's answer is based on the context's statement that Europe took 200 years, so the answer is correct.
5. Duration: until early 20th century. Correct.
6. Main cause: Yersinia pestis. Correct.
7. How it spread: via fleas on rats. The example says "navios mercantes", but the context says that the plague spread via the Silk Road to Crimea, then via fleas on Genoese ships. So the answer for question 2 is Genoese ships, but question 7 is about the method of spread. The answer would be "via fleas on rats."
8. Europe's recovery time: 200 years. Correct.
9. Role of the Silk Road: spreading to Crimea. Correct.
10. Role of Genoese ships: transporting the plague via fleas. Correct.

I think that's all. Now, I need to make sure each question is distinct and answers are accurate.
