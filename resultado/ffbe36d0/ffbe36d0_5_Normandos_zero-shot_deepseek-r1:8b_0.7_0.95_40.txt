Okay, I need to generate 10 pairs of questions and correct answers based on the given context about Normandos. Let me start by understanding what's provided.

First, I'll read through the context carefully. It mentions that Normandos were a Germanic people who migrated to Gaul, became prominent during the Merovingian dynasty, and their name comes from "Nordmann." They played significant roles in politics, military, administration, and cultural aspects. Their influence extended beyond France into other regions.

Now, I need to create varied questions covering different aspects. Let me outline possible areas: origins, achievements, impact on culture, political role, military contributions, administrative changes, their name's origin, expansion beyond Gaul, and regional influence.

For each question, the answer must be directly related to the context. Let me ensure that each question is unique and not repetitive. I'll structure them in Portuguese as specified.

1. **Origins**: Where did Normandos come from?
   - Answer: Germany.
   
2. **Merovingian Period**: During which dynasty were Normandos prominent?
