Okay, I need to generate 10 pairs of questions and answers based on the provided context about the Yuan dynasty. Let me first understand what information is given.

The Yuan dynasty was established in 1271 by Kublai Khan, who was the son of Genghis Khan. It lasted until 1368 when it was dissolved. The capital was Shangdu. They used specific page templates and had various cities under their rule. Some notable figures include Prince Yongsan and Princess Deongnyeong.

Now, I should create questions that cover different aspects of the Yuan dynasty. Each question should have a clear answer based on the context provided. Let me list possible topics:

1. Founded year
2. Capital location
3. Successor to Genghis Khan
4. Lived during the Yuan
5. Key battles involving Yuan
6. Notable figures and their fates
7. Relation to other dynasties
8. Images or symbols associated with Yuan

I'll make sure each question is unique and doesn't repeat too much information from the examples. I need to ensure that each answer directly references the context given, even if it's a date or a specific event.

Let me draft 10 questions:

1. Founded in which year did the Yuan dynasty begin?
2. What was the official name of the Yuan dynasty?
3. Who is considered the founder after Genghis Khan?
4. During the Yuan period, who was alive? (Kublai Khan)
5. What was a significant battle involving the Yuan dynasty?
6. Which figure's death marked an important event in Yuan history?
7. What impure state did the Yuan dynasty originate from?
8. What is a distinctive symbol or image of the Yuan dynasty?
9. How did Kublai Khan establish his dynasty? (Proclamation)
10. Which dynasty was established after the Yuan?

I think these cover various points and each has a clear answer based on the provided context.
