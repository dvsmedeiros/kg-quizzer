Okay, let's see. The user wants me to generate 10 question-answer pairs about Harvard University based on the provided data. The examples they gave are in Portuguese, so I need to make sure the new questions are also in Portuguese. 

First, I need to look through the data they provided. There's a lot of information here, including the names of people associated with Harvard, historical facts, the library system, and other details. The examples they included cover topics like the name of the school, when it became coeducational, the leader during the Great Depression, the association founded in 1900, the president who transformed it into a research university, the library system, number of libraries, volumes, number of US presidents and Nobel laureates.

Now, I need to create new questions that haven't been covered in the examples. Let me check the data again for other details. For instance, the data mentions several individuals linked to Harvard, like John Harvard (the namesake), Charles W. Eliot (the president), James Bryant Conant (the leader during the Great Depression), and others. There are also mentions of the Harvard Library system with 79 libraries and 18 million volumes. The examples already covered some of these, so I need to find other points.

Looking at the data, there's information about the university's categories, like being in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Also, there are depictions listed, but those might not be relevant for questions. The examples already mention the library and Nobel laureates, so I need to think of other aspects.

Wait, the data includes the sameAs link to VIAF, but that's probably not useful for questions. The foaf:depiction might be about images, but the examples didn't use that. Maybe the user wants questions based on the people listed in the data. For example, the examples have "John Harvard" as the namesake, but maybe there are other people associated with Harvard that the user hasn't mentioned yet.

Looking at the list of individuals, there are names like Robert Morris (cryptographer), William Klemperer, etc. But the examples don't cover them. However, the user might not want to use such obscure names. Alternatively, the data includes information about the university's categories, like being in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The examples didn't cover that, so maybe a question about the location.

Another point is the year the university became coeducational, which the examples already covered (1977). So I need to find other years or events. The examples also covered the leader during the Great Depression and WWII (James Bryant Conant), so maybe other leaders or events.

Wait, the data mentions "Harvard Library" as the largest academic and private library system. The examples covered that, but maybe the number of libraries (79) and volumes (18 million) are already covered. The examples also mentioned the number of Nobel laureates (150) and US presidents (8). 

Looking for other data points: the university's class in YAGO as Institution108053576, but that's probably not useful. The dcterms:subject is the category of universities in Cambridge, MA. The examples didn't ask about that, so maybe a question like "Em qual cidade e estado a Universidade de Harvard está localizada?" with the answer "Cambridge, Massachusetts."

Another possible point is the name of the university's mascot or other symbols, but the data doesn't mention that. The data includes depictions, like images of Henry Louis Gates, John Harvard statue, etc., but the examples didn't use that. Maybe a question about the mascot or notable landmarks, but without that info, it's hard.

Alternatively, the data might have other historical facts. The examples mentioned the transformation into a research university by Charles W. Eliot. Maybe other historical events or presidents.

Wait, the data has a list of individuals associated with Harvard, but the examples only used John Harvard and Charles W. Eliot. So perhaps other presidents or notable figures. For example, the data includes "Philip Young (ambassador)" as an alumnus, but that might not be as relevant as other presidents.

Alternatively, the number of students or faculty, but the data doesn't mention that. The examples didn't cover that, so maybe not. The data includes the number of libraries and volumes, which are already covered.

Another angle: the examples covered the association founded in 1900 (American Association of Universities). Maybe other associations or affiliations.

Wait, the data has "dcterms:subject <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Universities_and_colleges_in_Cambridge,_Massachusetts>;" which is about the location. So a question about that.

Also, the data includes the sameAs link to VIAF, but that's probably not useful for questions. The foaf:depiction links to images, but the examples didn't use that. Maybe not relevant.

Another possible point is the establishment year of Harvard University. But the examples don't mention that. However, the data might not have that information. The examples didn't include it, so I need to check the data. The data doesn't mention the founding year, so maybe that's not available. 

Alternatively, the number of Nobel laureates (150) and US presidents (8) are already covered. Maybe the number of alumni or other statistics, but the data doesn't include that.

Hmm, this is challenging. The user might expect questions based on the existing data, even if they are similar to the examples but phrased differently. For instance, instead of asking "Qual indivíduo recebeu o nome da escola?" (which is about John Harvard), maybe a question like "Qual é o nome do patrono da Universidade de Harvard?" with the same answer.

Alternatively, since the examples mention the library's size, maybe a question about the number of books or other library details. But the examples already covered that.

Wait, the examples have "Qual é o maior sistema de bibliotecas acadêmicas e privadas do mundo?" with the answer "Harvard Library," but the data says "Harvard Library," so that's covered. The number of libraries (79) and volumes (18 million) are also covered.

Another possible question: "Quantos prêmios Nobel de Literatura foram concedidos a ex-alunos da Universidade de Harvard?" But the data only mentions 150 Nobel laureates in total, not specifically Literature. So that might not be accurate.

Alternatively, the data includes names of people associated with Harvard, but the examples only used a few. Maybe asking about another notable alumnus, like "Quem é o ex-aluno da Universidade de Harvard que é um criptógrafo?" with the answer "Robert Morris."

But the user might prefer questions that are more general and not too specific to individual people unless it's a key figure. Since the examples used key figures (John Harvard, Charles Eliot, James Bryant Conant), maybe similar questions about other key figures.

Wait, the data has "Robert_Morris_(cryptographer)" with two alma maters. Maybe asking about him as an example. But the user might not want to focus too much on specific individuals unless it's a well-known figure.

Alternatively, the data mentions "Harvard Library" as the largest academic and private library system, but the examples already covered that. So maybe a question about the number of volumes again, but that's already in the examples.

Hmm, I'm running out of ideas. Let me check the data again for any other points. The examples covered the name of the school, coeducational status, leaders during specific periods, the association, the president who transformed the university, the library system, number of libraries, volumes, number of presidents, and Nobel laureates.

The data also includes the university's category (Universities and colleges in Cambridge, MA), which could be a question. Also, the sameAs link to VIAF, but that's not useful. The foaf:depiction links to images of people, but the examples didn't use that.

Maybe a question about the university's mascot or other symbols, but the data doesn't mention that. The data includes the name of the university's mascot? No, it doesn't. So that's not possible.

Another angle: the university's motto or other symbols. But the data doesn't have that info.

Alternatively, the number of departments or schools within Harvard. But the data doesn't mention that.

Wait, the examples have "Harvard Library" as the answer to "Qual é o maior sistema de bibliotecas acadêmicas e privadas do mundo?" Maybe a question about the number of libraries again, but that's already in the examples.

I think the best approach is to create questions based on the location (Cambridge, MA), the sameAs link (VIAF), and maybe other key individuals not covered in the examples. However, the VIAF link is probably not relevant for a question. 

Alternatively, the data mentions the university's class in YAGO as Institution108053576, but that's not useful. 

Another possible question: "Qual é o nome do líder da Universidade de Harvard durante a Segunda Guerra Mundial?" with the answer "James Bryant Conant," but that's already covered in the examples. 

Maybe a question about the establishment of the American Association of Universities in 1900, which the examples covered as "Que organização Harvard encontrou em 1900?" with the answer "Associação de Universidades Americanas."

So, perhaps the user wants questions that are similar but not exactly the same as the examples. For example, instead of "Quando o curso de graduação se tornou coeducacional?" which is about the year 1977, maybe "Em que ano a Universidade de Harvard tornou-se coeducacional?" with the same answer.

Alternatively, "Qual é o ano de fundação da Universidade de Harvard?" but the data doesn't include that information, so I can't answer that.

Another idea: the examples mention "Harvard Library" as the largest, so a question about that. But the examples already covered it. 

Wait, the data has "foaf:depiction" links to images of Henry Louis Gates, John Harvard statue, etc. Maybe a question like "Quem é retratado na imagem da Universidade de Harvard mencionada nos dados?" with the answer "Henry Louis Gates," but that's too specific and the data might not have that information. The examples didn't use depictions, so maybe not.

Alternatively, the data includes the sameAs link to VIAF, which is an identifier, but that's not useful for a question.

Hmm, I think I need to make do with what's available. The best options are the location (Cambridge, MA), the number of libraries (79), volumes (18 million), Nobel laureates (150), and US presidents (8). But the examples already covered some of these.

Wait, the examples have "Quantos prêmios Nobel de Literatura foram concedidos a ex-alunos da Universidade de Harvard?" but the data only mentions 150 Nobel laureates in total. However, the examples didn't ask that. Maybe a question about the total number of Nobel laureates, which is 150, but that's already in the examples.

I'm stuck. Maybe the user is okay with some repetition but phrased differently. For example, instead of "Qual indivíduo recebeu o nome da escola?" (John Harvard), maybe "Qual é o patrono da Universidade de Harvard?" with the same answer.

Alternatively, the examples have "Quem é o ex-aluno da Universidade de Harvard que é um criptógrafo?" with the answer "Robert Morris," but that's not in the examples. The data includes Robert Morris (cryptographer) as an alumnus, so that could be a question.

Another possible question: "Qual é a cidade e o estado onde a Universidade de Harvard está localizada?" with the answer "Cambridge, Massachusetts," since the dcterms:subject is about that category.

Yes, that's a good one. The examples didn't cover that. So that's a new question.

Another one: "Quantas bibliotecas compõem o sistema da Universidade de Harvard?" with the answer "79," which is already in the examples. But the examples have that as "Quantas bibliotecas compõem o sistema da Universidade de Harvard?" with the answer "79," so maybe rephrase it as "Qual é o número de bibliotecas no sistema da Universidade de Harvard?" with the same answer.

But the user might not want that. Alternatively, a question about the number of volumes: "Quantos volumes possui o sistema de bibliotecas da Universidade de Harvard?" with the answer "18 milhões."

But the examples already have that. Hmm.

Alternatively, "Quantos ex-alunos da Universidade de Harvard são laureados com o Prêmio Nobel?" with the answer "150," but the examples already have that as "Quantos prêmios Nobel foram concedidos a ex-alunos da Universidade de Harvard?" with the answer "150."

I think the safest new questions are about the location and the sameAs VIAF (but that's not useful). So the location is the best bet.
