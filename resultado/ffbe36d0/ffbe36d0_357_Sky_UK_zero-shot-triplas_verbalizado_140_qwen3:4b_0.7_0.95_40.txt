Okay, I need to generate 10 objective questions and answers based on the provided context and facts about British Satellite Broadcasting. Let me start by carefully reading through the given information to identify key points and facts that can be turned into questions.

First, the company was incorporated in November 1990 to form BSkyB, and it started transmitting in March 1990. The headquarters is in London, UK. They have several TV channels like The Movie Channel, The Power Station, Now, and Galaxy. They were founded in December 1986 and merged with Sky Television to form BSkyB. They were a direct broadcast satellite service and were disestablished in 1990. They have images and templates associated with their Wikipedia page, and they were part of the Sky Group. Also, some films were produced by them, like Hardware and Memphis Belle.

Now, I need to make sure the questions cover different aspects: founding date, location, merger, channels, services, and other related facts. Let me list possible questions:

1. When was British Satellite Broadcasting incorporated?
2. Where is the company located?
3. What year was the company founded?
4. Which organization did it merge with to form BSkyB?
5. What is the name of the TV channel that is a property of BSB?
6. What is the primary service provided by BSB?
7. What is the name of the company that succeeded BSB?
8. What is the name of one of the films produced by BSB?
9. What is the name of the logo image associated with BSB?
10. Which category does BSB belong to in terms of media companies?

Wait, but some of these might be too similar. Let me check the facts again to ensure each question is unique and based on the given data. For example, the merger with Sky Television to form BSkyB is a key point. Also, the channels like The Movie Channel, The Power Station, etc., are different. The primary service is direct broadcast satellite. The successor is Sky UK. The films include Hardware and Memphis Belle. The logo image is British Satellite Broadcasting logo.png. The category is Mass media companies established in 1986.

I need to make sure each question is distinct and the answers are directly from the facts provided. Let me structure them accordingly, ensuring that each answer is specific and accurate based on the given information.
