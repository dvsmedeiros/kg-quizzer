Okay, let's tackle this query. The user provided a bunch of data about Jacksonville, Florida, in RDF format, and some example questions and answers. They want me to generate 10 more question-answer pairs based on the data.

First, I need to look through the data provided. The main entity is Jacksonville, Florida, with various properties. Let me check the attributes:

- Established title: "Founded"
- Feb Low F: 46.1
- Jun Precipitation: 7.6 inches
- May Avg Low: 50.7
- Population Density: 490.63 per km²
- Metro Population: 1,733,937
- Population Rank: 12
- Wikipedia template links
- Exact match to a wordnet entry
- Depictions (images)
- Nicknames: "Jax", "The River City", "The Bold New City of the South"

Now, looking at the examples given, they asked about population, ranking, county, river, distance, historical colony, indigenous people, and the figure after whom it's named. So I need to come up with similar questions but based on the data provided.

Let me think of possible questions:

1. What is the population density of Jacksonville?
   - The data has "populationDensityKm" as 490.63. So the answer is 490.63 per km².

2. What is the average low temperature in May?
   - The value is "mayAvgRecordLowF" as 50.7. So 50.7°F.

3. What is the precipitation in June?
   - "junPrecipitationInch" is 7.6 inches.

4. What is the nickname of Jacksonville?
   - The nicknames are "Jax", "The River City", "The Bold New City of the South". So the answer can list those.

5. What is the rank of Jacksonville in terms of population in the US?
   - "populationRank" is 12, so 12th.

6. What is the population of the Jacksonville metropolitan area?
   - "populationMetro" is 1,733,937.

7. What is the lowest temperature in February?
   - "febLowF" is 46.1°F.

8. What is the name of the river that flows through Jacksonville?
   - The example mentioned St. Johns River, but the data doesn't have that. Wait, the data doesn't mention the river name. The example answer was "St. Johns," but the user's data doesn't have that. Wait, the user's data might not have that info. So maybe I can't use that. Hmm, but the example had that. Maybe the data is missing that, but the user's example includes it. But according to the data provided, there's no river mentioned. So I can't ask that. So I need to avoid that.

Wait, in the examples, one of the answers was "St. Johns," but in the data provided, there's no mention of the river. So maybe that's from external knowledge. But the user's instruction says to use only the data provided. So I can't include that. So I need to avoid that question.

So, back to generating questions. Let's see:

9. What is the name of the template used in Jacksonville's Wikipedia page?
   - The data has "wikiPageUsesTemplate" with several templates like "Template:Div_col_end", "Template:Navboxes". So the answer could be those.

10. What is the exact match wordnet entry for Jacksonville?
    - The data has "skos:exactMatch" as "http://globalwordnet.org/ili/i84298". So the answer is that URI, but maybe the user expects the name. But the data doesn't provide a name, just the URI. So maybe the answer is the URI, but perhaps the user wants the term. Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the user expects the answer to be "globalwordnet.org/ili/i84298" but I need to check the data.

Another possible question: What are the nicknames of Jacksonville?
   - The "foaf:nick" field has "Jax", "The River City", "The Bold New City of the South".

Another: What is the population of Jacksonville according to the data?
   - The data has "populationMetro" as 1,733,937, but the city's population might be different. Wait, the example answer for the population in 2010 was 1,345,596, but the data here has "populationMetro" as 1,733,937. So maybe the question could be about the metro population.

So let's list 10 questions:

1. What is the population density of Jacksonville, Florida?
   - 490.63 per km².

2. What is the average low temperature in May for Jacksonville?
   - 50.7°F.

3. What is the precipitation in June for Jacksonville?
   - 7.6 inches.

4. What are the nicknames of Jacksonville?
   - "Jax", "The River City", "The Bold New City of the South".

5. What is the population rank of Jacksonville in the United States?
   - 12th.

6. What is the population of the Jacksonville metropolitan area?
   - 1,733,937.

7. What is the lowest temperature recorded in February in Jacksonville?
   - 46.1°F.

8. What templates are used on the Wikipedia page of Jacksonville?
   - "Template:Div_col_end", "Template:Navboxes".

9. What is the exact match wordnet entry for Jacksonville?
   - "http://globalwordnet.org/ili/i84298".

10. What is the name of the river that flows through Jacksonville?
    - The data doesn't mention it, so I can't include this. So replace with another.

Alternative 10: What is the city where the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit is located?
   - The data has "United_States_Court_of_Appeals_for_the_Eleventh_Circuit" with "dutyStation" as Jacksonville. So the answer is Jacksonville.

Yes, that's a valid question based on the data.

So the 10 pairs would be:

1. Q: What is the population density of Jacksonville, Florida?
   A: 490.63 per km².

2. Q: What is the average low temperature in May for Jacksonville?
   A: 50.7°F.

- Nicknames: "foaf:nick" has those.
- Population rank: "populationRank" is 12.
- Metro population: "populationMetro" is 1,733,937.
