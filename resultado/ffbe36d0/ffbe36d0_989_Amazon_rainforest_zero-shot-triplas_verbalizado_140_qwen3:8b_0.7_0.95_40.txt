Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs based on the provided context and facts about the Amazon rainforest. Let me start by going through the context and facts to identify key points.

First, the context mentions that the Amazon spans 7 million km², with 5.5 million covered by the rainforest, and it's in nine countries, mostly Brazil. The "Amazônia Legal" is defined by the SUDAM in 1966, covering 49.29% of Brazil. It's the largest biome in Brazil, part of the six major biomes. The UNESCO site in 2000 includes the Parque Nacional do Jaú. Also, it's been a candidate for the New7Wonders of Nature.

Looking at the facts, there are many images, categories, and specific data points. For example, the Amazon rainforest is located in Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, French Guiana, Guyana, Peru, Suriname, and Venezuela. It's part of the "ProtectedArea" type and has several categories like "Rainforests", "Amazon biome", etc. Specific people like Guillermo Cervantes and Maria Koepcke died there, and there's info about deforestation, images, and models used in Wikipedia.

I need to create varied questions that cover different aspects. Let me list possible questions:

1. Which countries does the Amazon rainforest span?
2. What percentage of Brazil's territory is covered by the "Amazônia Legal"?
3. What is the name of the UNESCO World Heritage Site in the Amazon?
4. What is the total area of the Amazon rainforest?
5. Which organization defined the "Amazônia Legal" in 1966?
6. What is the largest biome in Brazil?
7. Which country has the largest portion of the Amazon rainforest?
8. What is the name of the Brazilian state where the Parque Nacional do Jaú is located?
9. What is the primary economic activity affecting the Amazon?
10. Which Wikipedia template is used for the Amazon rainforest's infobox?

Wait, the last question about the Wikipedia template might be too technical. Maybe better to focus on more factual aspects. Let me check the facts again. There's mention of "modelo de página wiki Template:Infobox forest" and other templates. But maybe the user wants questions based on the context, not just Wikipedia templates. Let me adjust.

Alternative questions:

1. What is the total area of the Amazon rainforest?
2. Which country has the largest portion of the Amazon rainforest?
3. What is the name of the UNESCO World Heritage Site in the Amazon?
4. What is the primary purpose of the "Amazônia Legal"?
5. Which countries are part of the Amazon rainforest?
6. What is the name of the Brazilian state where the Parque Nacional do Jaú is located?
7. What is the main reason for deforestation in the Amazon?
8. Who are some notable individuals who died in the Amazon rainforest?
9. What is the significance of the Amazon rainforest in terms of biodiversity?
10. What is the name of the Brazilian state where the Parque Nacional do Jaú is located?

Wait, some questions are repeating. Need to ensure they are varied. Also, the answer to question 6 and 10 might be the same. Let me check the facts again. The Parque Nacional do Jaú is in the Amazon, but which state? The context says it's part of the "Amazônia Legal" which includes three regions: Norte, Nordeste, and Centro-Oeste. But specific states might not be mentioned. Alternatively, maybe the answer is Brazil. Wait, the context says "no Brasil, por efeitos de governo e economia, a Amazônia é delimitada por uma área chamada 'Amazônia Legal'..." So the Parque Nacional do Jaú is in Brazil. But the question should be based on the facts given. Let me check the facts again. The facts mention "Amazon rainforest está localizado no país Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, French Guiana, Guyana, Peru, Suriname, e Venezuela." So the answer to question 5 would be those countries. 

Another fact is that Guillermo Cervantes and Maria Koepcke died there. So question 8 could be about those individuals. 

For the UNESCO site, the context says "Parque Nacional do Jaú" is part of the UNESCO site in 2000. 

The main economic activity affecting the Amazon is deforestation, which is mentioned in the facts with images of deforestation. 

The "Amazônia Legal" was defined by SUDAM in 1966. 

The total area of the Amazon rainforest is 5.5 million km². 

The largest portion is in Brazil. 

The Amazon is the largest biome in Brazil. 

So compiling these into 10 varied questions with specific answers. Let me make sure each answer is directly supported by the text. For example, the total area is 5.5 million km², countries are the list provided, UNESCO site is Parque Nacional do Jaú, etc.
