Okay, I need to generate 10 pairs of questions and answers related to construction, specifically focusing on the context provided. Let me start by understanding what each part requires.

First, each question should relate to a different aspect of construction. The context mentions various companies involved in construction, so maybe I can create questions about specific projects or companies. Also, terms like reforma, liberty property trust, aoki construction, etc., are mentioned as products in the construction industry.

I need to ensure that each response is clear and directly related to the question. For example, if the question is about what construction uses, the answer would be its role in measuring economic activity, which makes sense.

Next, I should consider varying the subjects: some can focus on technology in construction, others on specific companies or projects like building a bridge. Also, terms like "Re assurance" and "Construction News" are important to include as they represent different aspects of the industry.

I need to make sure each response is concise but informative enough for someone learning about construction. No markdown, just plain JSON with two keys: question and answer. I also have to avoid any assumptions or extra information outside the given context.

Let me think through some questions:

1. What role does construction play in measuring economic activity? Construction uses GDP by calculating net construction spending.
2. Which company is known for constructing large bridges?
3. How much does construction cost on average?
4. What tools are essential for a construction project?
5. Who develops the plans and designs for buildings?
6. In which industries is construction commonly used as infrastructure?
7. What materials are typically used in construction projects?
8. What's the primary function of a construction manager?
9. How does technology influence construction projects?
10. Which organizations focus on publishing construction news?

Now, I'll draft each question and answer pair ensuring they cover different aspects and are accurate based on available information.
