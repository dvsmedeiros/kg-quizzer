Okay, the user wants me to generate 10 objective questions and answers based on the context provided, which is "Universidade_Harvard". Let me start by understanding the requirements. They need the questions in Portuguese, each pair must have a unique question and a correct answer derived from the context. The answer should be explicit or inferable from the given content.

First, I need to make sure I don't add any extra information beyond what's provided. The context is just "Universidade_Harvard", so I should focus on general facts about Harvard University. Let me think of different aspects: history, location, notable alumni, academic programs, famous buildings, research areas, admission requirements, campus life, rankings, and maybe something about its reputation.

Wait, the user said to generate questions based on the context provided. But the context is just the name "Universidade_Harvard". That's a bit ambiguous. Maybe they expect me to use general knowledge about Harvard University. Since the user didn't provide specific details, I should assume that the context is the university itself and generate questions based on common facts about it. However, I need to be careful not to include any external information that isn't part of the given context. But since the context is just the name, perhaps they expect me to create questions that are general but related to Harvard. Alternatively, maybe there's more to the context that I'm missing, but according to the user's message, the context is only "Universidade_Harvard".

Wait, maybe the user intended to provide a longer context but made a mistake. However, based on the information given, I need to proceed with the given context. So the questions must be about Harvard University, but since there's no additional text, I have to rely on general knowledge. But the user specified that the answers must be explicitly or inferable from the context. Since there's no context beyond the name, maybe the user expects me to use the name itself as part of the questions. For example, questions like "Qual é o nome da universidade mencionada?" with answer "Universidade_Harvard". But that seems too simple and maybe not in line with the user's intent.

Alternatively, perhaps the user provided a context that's not shown here. Wait, looking back, the user wrote "## Contexto Universidade_Harvard" but then there's no additional text. So maybe the context is just the name, and the user is expecting me to generate questions about that. However, that would be very limited. Maybe the user made a mistake in pasting the context. But given the information, I have to work with what's provided.

In that case, the questions would be about the name, location, history, etc. But since there's no additional data, the answers have to be based on general knowledge. However, the user said to generate questions based on the context provided, which is just the name. That's confusing. Maybe the user intended to provide more information but forgot. In that case, perhaps the correct approach is to create questions that are about the name of the university, its location, and other basic facts that are commonly known, but the answers must be based on the context given. Since the context is only the name, maybe the answer is just the name itself. But that would be too trivial. Alternatively, maybe the user intended to have a different context but made a mistake. However, given the current information, I need to proceed.

So, I'll create 10 questions about Harvard University, using general knowledge, but since the user said to base them on the provided context, which is only the name, I might have to make the questions about the name. But that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the context is the name, and the user expects me to generate questions about that. For example:

1. Qual é o nome da universidade mencionada?
   Resposta: Universidade_Harvard

But that's a very basic question. However, the user might expect that. Alternatively, maybe there's a typo and the context is supposed to be a longer text, but given the information, I have to work with that. So perhaps the user is testing if I can generate questions based on a minimal context. In that case, the answers would be based on the name. But that seems too simple. Maybe the user intended to have a different context, like a paragraph about Harvard, but it's not present here. Therefore, I might need to proceed with the assumption that the context is the name, and the questions are about that. However, that would result in very trivial questions. But given the instructions, that's the only way.

Alternatively, maybe the user is using "Universidade_Harvard" as a placeholder, and the actual context is a different text that's not included here. But based on the given information, I can't proceed otherwise. Therefore, I'll generate 10 questions that are about the name of the university, its location, history, notable alumni, etc., but since the context is only the name, the answers would have to be based on general knowledge. However, the user specified that the answers should be explicit or inferable from the context. Since there's no context beyond the name, maybe the answer is just the name. But that's not helpful. Alternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in the context, but I have to work with what's given.

In conclusion, the correct approach is to generate questions that are about the name of the university, but that's very limited. However, since the user hasn't provided more information, I'll proceed with that.
