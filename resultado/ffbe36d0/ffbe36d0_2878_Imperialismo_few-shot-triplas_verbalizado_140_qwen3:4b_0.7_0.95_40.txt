Okay, I need to generate 10 objective questions and answers based on the provided context and facts. Let me start by carefully reading through the given information to make sure I understand all the key points.

The context explains that the term "imperialism" comes from Latin "imperium" meaning power or authority. It describes a political structure with a central authority over peripheral regions. The facts list various elements related to imperialism, such as associated people (Wolfgang Mommsen), images, templates used in Wikipedia, political parties with imperialist ideologies, historical events, and more.

I need to create questions that cover different aspects of the information. Let me go through the facts and think of possible questions. For example, the term "imperialism" is derived from Latin, so that's a good starting point. Then, there's the mention of the Roman Empire as an example. Also, there are various images and templates associated with the topic.

I should ensure that each question is unique and covers different areas. Let me check the examples provided. They include questions about the origin of the term, how it's administered, examples of different types, associated people, and the use of certain images or models.

I need to avoid repeating similar questions. For instance, the examples have a question about the origin of the term, another about the administration, and another about the types of imperialism. So I should create similar but distinct questions.

Looking at the facts, there are mentions of the Canadian Conservative Party and the Progressive Party of Cape Colony having imperialist ideologies. Also, the Herero and Namaqua genocide is linked to imperialism as a motivation. The term "imperialism" is associated with certain categories and images.

I should make sure the questions are based on the provided facts and not on external knowledge. For example, the fact that "Imperialism possui imagem representativa Resa del bacino del Brandewater.jpg" can be used to ask about an image associated with imperialism.

Another point is the use of various Wikipedia templates, such as Template:Cite encyclopedia, Template:Main article, etc. So a question could be about which template is used for the page on imperialism.

Also, the fact that "Imperialism é do tipo Organisation" could be a question about the type of entity imperialism is categorized as.

I need to make sure that each answer is directly from the provided facts. For instance, the answer to a question about the origin of the term should be "latina" as per the context. Another answer could be about the central authority in an empire, which is the metrópole.

I need to generate 10 distinct questions. Let me list possible topics: origin of the term, definition, associated people, types of imperialism, political ideologies linked to it, images used, templates used, categories, historical events, and the type of entity (organisation or thing).

Now, let me structure each question and answer pair based on these points, ensuring they are all correct and from the given information.
