Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to approach this query about generating multiple-choice questions based on the context provided. The user wants exactly 10 pairs of questions and correct answers in Portuguese, focusing solely on the given content without any extra information.

First, I need to understand the structure they're asking for. It's a JSON array with objects containing "pergunta" and "resposta." Each question should be unique and cover different aspects of the context provided, which is about Vitória in Australia. Wait, no—actually, Vitória can refer to a few places. In this case, since it's specified as "Vitória_(Austrália)," I think they're referring to Victoria, the state in Australia.

Looking at the example response they provided, I notice that the questions are about geography, history, and notable features of Victoria. So, I need to make sure each question is varied and touches on different aspects like capital cities, geographical features, population, historical events, etc.

I should start by identifying key points from the context about Victoria. For example, it's located in southeastern Australia, its capital is Melbourne, famous for the Great Ocean Road, has a diverse economy, and significant gold rush history. Also, it's known for agriculture and wine production.

Now, I need to generate 10 unique questions based on these points. Each question should have only one correct answer that's directly or indirectly supported by the context. Let me think of different categories: geography, demographics, economy, history, culture, etc.

I'll start with the capital city since it's a fundamental fact. Then move to geographical landmarks like the Great Ocean Road. Next, population size compared to other states. The date Victoria became a state is another historical point. Nicknames like "Garden State" are cultural and historical. Major industries would cover economy aspects. Proximity to Tasmania, European settlement history, wine regions, and finally, the largest city.

I should make sure that each question isn't too similar to others and covers a broad range of topics related to Victoria. Also, I need to ensure that the answers are accurate based on common knowledge about Victoria.

Wait, in the example provided by the user, they included questions about the Great Ocean Road and Phillip Island as well. So I should include those if they're relevant. But since the context given is minimal, I might have to infer some facts.

I also need to make sure that each question is clear and directly related to Victoria without ambiguity. For example, when asking about a nickname, it's important to specify it refers to Victoria to avoid confusion with other regions that might share similar nicknames.

Additionally, I should vary the type of questions: some could be direct facts, others might require understanding or inference. But in this case, since the answers need to be explicitly correct, I'll focus on straightforward facts unless inferred from the context.

Now, compiling all these points into 10 distinct questions and their answers. Let me list them out:

1. Capital city?
2. Located in which part of Australia?
3. Known for what coastal road?
4. When did it become a state?
5. What's its nickname?
6. What's the main industry?
7. Which island is nearby?
8. What's the population compared to other states?
9. Where is its capital located?
10. What's Victoria famous for besides wine?

Wait, I need to make sure each question is unique and not overlapping in content. For example, questions about Melbourne can be split into different aspects: location, as a port city, etc.

Also, I should double-check facts like the population of Victoria and its proximity to Tasmania. Making sure dates are accurate, like when it became a state after separation from New South Wales.

I think that covers all necessary points without repetition. Now, structuring each question and ensuring the answers are correct.
