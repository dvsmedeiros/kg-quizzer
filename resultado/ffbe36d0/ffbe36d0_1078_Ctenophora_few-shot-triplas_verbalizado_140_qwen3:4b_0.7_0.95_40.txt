Okay, I need to generate 10 objective questions and answers based on the provided context and facts about Ctenophora. Let me start by carefully reading through the context and the list of facts to make sure I cover all the key points.

The context mentions that Ctenophora are marine animals with a cosmopolitan distribution, mostly planktonic, some benthic, bioluminescent, and have distinctive ctenes (rows of cilia) for swimming. They are similar to jellyfish but not closely related. They're the largest non-colonial animals that move using cilia, ranging from 1mm to 1.5m. They're sometimes called comb jellies. They have a fossil record since the Cambrian.

Looking at the facts, there are several points: their common names, classification as Animal, types of subdivisions like Tentaculata, Nuda, Scleroctenophora, taxonomic status, use of templates in wiki, images, and other related organisms like Coelenterata, Callianira hexagona, Vallicula, etc. Also, the type species is Mnemiopsis leidyi, and they were described by Eschscholtz in 1829.

Now, I need to make sure the questions are varied and cover different aspects. Let me think of possible questions:

1. What is the common name for Ctenophora?
2. What is the Greek origin of the term "Ctenophora"?
3. What is the primary method of locomotion for Ctenophora?
4. What is the size range of Ctenophora?
5. What is the taxonomic classification of Ctenophora?
6. Which subdivision is part of the Ctenophora group?
7. What is the type species of Ctenophora?
8. When were Ctenophora first described?
9. What is the significance of the fossil record of Ctenophora?
10. What is the role of ctenes in Ctenophora?

Wait, but the user provided examples with some of these. Let me check the facts again to ensure the answers are accurate. For example, the common names are "comb jellies" or "sea walnuts". The Greek origin is from "ktēs" (comb) and "phērō" (carry). The primary locomotion is ctenes (rows of cilia). The size range is 1mm to 1.5m. Taxonomic classification as Animal. Subdivisions include Tentaculata, Nuda, Scleroctenophora. Type species is Mnemiopsis leidyi. First described by Eschscholtz in 1829. Fossil record since Cambrian. The ctenes are for swimming.

I need to avoid repetition. Let me check if I have 10 unique questions. Also, the examples had some of these, but I need to make sure not to repeat. The user's examples had questions about size, locomotion, common name, etc. So I should create 10 different ones, perhaps including some from the facts like the use of templates, images, and other related organisms. But the user's example didn't include those, so maybe focus on the main points.

Wait, the facts mention that Ctenophora uses certain wiki templates, but the example questions didn't include that. Maybe the user wants the questions based on the context and facts, so maybe include some from the facts like the subdivisions or the taxonomic status. Let me make sure to cover all aspects. Also, the answer should be explicit or inferable from the context.

So, compiling the 10 questions:

1. Common name
2. Greek origin
3. Locomotion method
4. Size range
5. Taxonomic classification
6. Subdivision
7. Type species
8. Date of first description
9. Fossil record significance
10. Role of ctenes

That's 10. Now check if these are all covered in the context and facts. Yes. Now write them in Portuguese, ensuring the answers are correct based on the given data.
