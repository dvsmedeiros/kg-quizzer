Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs based on the given context and facts about the French and Indian War. Let me start by reading through the context and the facts carefully.

The context mentions that the French and Indian War was part of the Seven Years' War, fought between 1754 and 1763. Key points include the alliances with Native American tribes, the role of naval power, and major events like the capture of Louisbourg and Quebec. The facts list various battles, participants, and other details.

First, I should make sure each question is unique and covers different aspects. Let me brainstorm possible questions:

1. **When did the French and Indian War take place?**  
   The context states 1754–1763. That's straightforward.

2. **What was the main reason for the conflict?**  
   The context mentions disputes over control of the Ohio River valley, like the Forks of the Ohio. But the facts don't mention this directly. Wait, the context says it was part of the Seven Years' War, but the facts have "French and Indian War possui data --05-28" which might be a placeholder. Maybe better to use the context's dates.

3. **Which Native American tribes allied with the French?**  
   The context mentions "Algonquin, Wabanaki Confederacy, etc." The facts list "Algonquin", "Wabanaki Confederacy", "Ojibwa", "Catawba", "Mohawk", "Seneca", "Oneida", "Tuscarora", "Haudenosaunee", "Delaware", "Shawnee", "Lenape", "Iroquois", "Mohican", "Mohawk", "Oneida", "Tuscarora", "Haudenosaunee", "Delaware", "Shawnee", "Lenape", "Iroquois", "Mohican", etc. So I can mention some of these.

4. **Who were the main European powers involved?**  
   The context says "colônias da América Britânica e da Nova França" (British colonies and New France). So Britain and France.

5. **What was the significance of naval power in the war?**  
   The context states that the control of the Gulf of St. Lawrence and the ability to transport troops and supplies were crucial. So naval power was key.

6. **Which major battle led to the capture of Quebec?**  
   The context mentions the Battle of the Plains of Abraham in 1759, where Wolfe defeated Montcalm. The facts list "Battle of Ticonderoga (1759)" but that's different. Wait, the context says "the capture of Quebec in 1759" and "James Wolfe" was involved. So the answer would be the Battle of the Plains of Abraham.

7. **Who was the British commander who captured Louisbourg?**  
   The facts mention "James Wolfe" and "James Abercrombie", but the context says "General Wolfe at the siege of Louisbourg, 1758". So James Wolfe.

8. **What was the outcome of the war for the French in North America?**  
   The context says "the French were defeated, leading to the cession of New France to Britain". So the French lost their territories.

9. **What role did the Long Rifle play in the war?**  
   The facts mention "Long rifle foi usado na guerra French and Indian War". So the answer is that it was used by American colonists.

10. **Which event marked the beginning of the war?**  
    The context mentions the Battle of Jumonville Glen in 1754. The facts have "Battle of Echoee" and "Battle on Snowshoes", but the context specifies the Jumonville Glen as the start.

Wait, need to check if all answers are from the context or facts. Let me verify each:

1. **Dates:** Context says 1754–1763. Correct.

2. **Causes:** The context says it was part of the Seven Years' War, but the facts don't mention specific causes. However, the example questions include "Como começou a guerra?" which is answered with the Battle of Jumonville Glen. Maybe I can use that.

3. **Native allies:** Context mentions "Algonquin, Wabanaki Confederacy, etc." So the answer can list some.

4. **European powers:** Britain and France, as per context.

5. **Naval significance:** The context mentions the control of the Gulf of St. Lawrence and transporting troops.

6. **Battle of Quebec:** The context says "the capture of Quebec in 1759" and "James Wolfe" was involved. The Battle of the Plains of Abraham is the key one.

7. **Louisbourg capture:** The facts mention "General Wolfe at the siege of Louisbourg, 1758", so James Wolfe.

8. **Outcome for France:** The context says "the French were defeated, leading to the cession of New France to Britain."

9. **Long Rifle:** Facts say "Long rifle foi usado na guerra French and Indian War".

10. **Beginning event:** Context mentions the Battle of Jumonville Glen in 1754.

Now, I need to structure these into 10 pairs, ensuring they are distinct and based on the given data. Avoid repeating the same answer points. Check for uniqueness.
