Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs based on the provided context and facts about the Yuan Dynasty. Let me start by reviewing the context and the list of facts to identify key points.

First, the Yuan Dynasty was founded by Kublai Khan in 1271. That's a primary fact. Then there's the capital, which is mentioned as Shangdu and Khanbaliq (which I think is the same as Dadu). The dynasty ended in 1368. The religious practices are listed, so maybe a question about that. Also, there are mentions of events like the Battle of Yamen and the Mongol conquest of the Song dynasty. 

Looking at the facts, there's information about the capital, the end date, the founder, the religion, and some battles. I should ensure each question is unique and covers different aspects. For example, one question about the founder, another about the capital, another about the end date, one about the religion, and others about events or related entities. 

I need to make sure each answer is directly inferable from the facts provided. For instance, the start date is 1271, the end is 1368. The capital is mentioned as Shangdu and Khanbaliq. The religion includes Buddhism, Mongolian Tengrism, etc. Also, the dynasty occurred before the Song and Goryeo, so those can be questions about which dynasties came before. 

Wait, the example given includes questions about the name in Chinese, official name, founder, etc. I should follow a similar structure but ensure the questions are varied. Let me check the list of facts again. There's also information about the dynasty's type, like being a former country, and some images and templates used. But maybe focus on the more straightforward facts like dates, capitals, founders, events, and related entities. 

I need to avoid repeating questions. For example, one about the founder, another about the end date, another about the capital, another about the religion, and others about battles or related dynasties. Also, the dynasty is part of the Postclassical Era and has a specific classification as a former country in East Asia. 

Let me list possible questions:
1. Who founded the Yuan Dynasty?
2. When was the Yuan Dynasty established?
3. What was the capital of the Yuan Dynasty?
4. Which dynasty preceded the Yuan Dynasty?
5. What religion was practiced during the Yuan Dynasty?
6. Which battle was part of the Yuan Dynasty's military campaigns?
7. When did the Yuan Dynasty end?
8. What was the official name of the Yuan Dynasty?
9. Which dynasty came after the Yuan Dynasty?
10. What was the significance of the Yuan Dynasty in terms of religious practices?

Now, I need to verify each answer based on the facts. For example, the official name is "Great Yuan" or "Yuan Dynasty" in Chinese. The end date is 1368. The religion includes multiple faiths. The Battle of Yamen is mentioned as an event. The capital is Shangdu and Khanbaliq. The dynasty that came before is the Song Dynasty. The dynasty that followed is the Ming Dynasty. 

Wait, the user's example includes a question about the dynasty that came after, which is Ming, and the one that came before is Song. That's correct. Also, the official name is "Great Yuan" or "Yuan Dynasty" in Chinese. The founder is Kublai Khan. The start date is 1271. The end date is 1368. 

I need to make sure the answers are precise. For example, the capital is both Shangdu and Khanbaliq. The religion is listed as Buddhism, Mongolian Tengrism, etc. The dynasty occurred before the Song and Goryeo. 

Now, structuring these into 10 pairs without repetition and ensuring each question is distinct. Let me check the list again to ensure all answers are correct. Also, avoid using any markdown and ensure the JSON format is correct.
