Okay, the user wants me to generate 10 objective questions and answers based on the context provided, which is "Fresno". But wait, the context given is just the word "Fresno". I need to figure out what information is available here.

First, I should check if there's any specific content related to Fresno that the user expects me to use. However, the user only provided the word "Fresno" as the context. That's pretty vague. Maybe they're referring to a city, a person, a book, or something else? Since the user didn't provide any additional details, I need to make assumptions based on common knowledge.

Fresno is a city in California, USA. It's the second-largest city in the state. So, possible topics could be its population, location, famous things, historical facts, etc. But without more information, I need to create questions that are general but based on common facts about Fresno.

I should make sure that each question is unique and covers different aspects. Let me brainstorm 10 different aspects of Fresno. For example:

1. Location (state)
2. Population
3. Notable industry
4. Historical significance
5. Largest employer
6. Education institutions
7. Cultural landmarks
8. Climate
9. Major highways
10. Economic importance

Now, I need to verify the accuracy of each fact. For example, Fresno is in California, population around 500k, known for agriculture, University of California, Fresno, major highways like I-5, etc. But I need to make sure the facts are correct. Wait, but the user didn't provide any specific context, so maybe they expect me to use general knowledge. However, the user said to generate questions based on the given context, which is only "Fresno". So I have to rely on common knowledge.

Wait, but the user might have intended to provide a longer context but forgot. But according to the instructions, the context is only "Fresno". So I need to proceed with that.

Another thing: the user mentioned that each question must be related to the provided context. Since the context is just "Fresno", I need to make sure that the questions are about Fresno, not other places with the same name. For example, there's a Fresno in Spain, but the most well-known is in California.

So, I'll create 10 questions based on common facts about Fresno, California. Let me check each fact again to ensure they're correct.

1. Location: State is California. Correct.
2. Population: Approximately 500,000. Correct.
3. Notable industry: Agriculture, especially grapes and fruits. Correct.
4. Historical significance: Founded in 1853. Correct.
5. Largest employer: University of California, Fresno. Correct.
6. Education: University of California, Fresno. Correct.
7. Cultural: Fresno Fair. Correct.
8. Climate: Semi-arid. Correct.
9. Highways: I-5 and I-10. Correct.
10. Economic: Major agricultural hub. Correct.

I think these are all accurate. Now, I need to phrase each question in Portuguese, ensuring they're clear and each answer is correct. Also, avoid repetition. The user wants 10 pairs, each with a unique question and answer. Let me structure them as per the JSON format.
