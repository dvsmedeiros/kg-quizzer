Okay, so I need to create 10 pairs of questions and answers based on the context provided about Jacksonville. The user has given some examples in Portuguese, which is helpful because I'm supposed to generate the output in Portuguese too. Let me think through how to approach this.

First, I should carefully review the content about Jacksonville to understand all the key points that can be turned into questions. The example provided includes information about population, area, state, geographical features like rivers and beaches, climate, economic sectors, sports teams, cultural aspects like museums and music genres, festivals, transportation, and nearby cities.

I need to make sure each question is unique and covers different aspects without overlapping too much with others. Also, the answers should be directly taken or clearly inferred from the content. I have to avoid any guesses beyond what's provided.

Let me list out possible categories based on the example:

1. Demographics (population)
2. Geography (rivers, beaches)
3. Climate
4. Economy
5. Sports
6. Culture (museums, music)
7. Festivals/Events
8. Transportation
9. Nearby cities
10. Area size

I should ensure that each of these areas is covered with one question each to make the set comprehensive.

Now, I'll think about specific questions for each category:

- Demographics: Maybe something about the population ranking in the US.
- Geography: Perhaps a question about which river flows through Jacksonville.
- Climate: A question about average temperatures or months when it's hot.
- Economy: What economic sectors are prominent there.
- Sports: Which professional teams are based there.
- Culture: Notable museums or cultural events.
- Festivals/Events: Specific festivals like the Seafood Festival.
- Transportation: Major highways or public transport options.
- Nearby cities: Cities within a certain distance, like Orlando.
- Area size: How big Jacksonville is compared to other cities.

I need to make sure each question has only one correct answer and that it's clear from the context. Also, I should vary the structure of the questions—some could be "qual," others "como," or "onde" types in Portuguese.

Let me check for any possible repeats. The example had 10 distinct areas, so as long as I don't duplicate topics, I should be fine.

I also need to ensure that all the answers are accurate based on the provided content. For instance, if it mentions that Jacksonville has a certain number of museums or specific economic sectors, those should be accurately reflected in the answers.

Now, I'll start drafting each pair:

1. **Pergunta:** Qual é a população de Jacksonville?  
   **Resposta:** Aproximadamente 907.852 habitantes.

2. **Pergunta:** Em qual estado está localizada Jacksonville?  
   **Resposta:** Estado da Flórida.

3. **Pergunta:** Qual rio banha Jacksonville?  
   **Resposta:** Rio St. Johns.

4. **Pergunta:** Quais são as praias famosas perto de Jacksonville?  
   **Resposta:** Jacksonville Beach e Neptune Beach.

5. **Pergunta:** Qual é a temperatura média no verão em Jacksonville?  
   **Resposta:** Entre 28°C e 34°C.

6. **Pergunta:** Quais setores econômicos são importantes para Jacksonville?  
   **Resposta:** Comércio, turismo e indústria.

7. **Pergunta:** Qual é o time de beisebol profissional de Jacksonville?  
   **Resposta:** Jacksonville Jumbo Shrimp (afiliado dos Miami Marlins).

8. **Pergunta:** Quais museus são destaque em Jacksonville?  
   **Resposta:** Museu de Arte de Jacksonville e Museu de História Natural.

9. **Pergunta:** Qual festival anual acontece em Jacksonville?  
   **Resposta:** Festival da Cevada & Blues.

10. **Pergunta:** Qual avenida principal corta Jacksonville?  
    **Resposta:** Avenida Bay Street.

Wait, I think the last one might not be as clear. The example mentioned that Bay Street is a famous street but didn't specify it's an avenue. Maybe instead of asking about an avenue, I can ask about a well-known street or highway.

Alternatively, considering transportation, perhaps a question about major highways would be better, like I-95. Or maybe about public transport options. Let me adjust that last pair to ensure clarity and accuracy based on the content provided.

I should also make sure not to repeat any information from the example unless it's necessary for variety. Since the example had 10 pairs covering various aspects, I need to cover as many different areas as possible without overlapping too much.

Let me reconsider the last question to be about transportation infrastructure, such as highways:

10. **Pergunta:** Qual é a principal rodovia que passa por Jacksonville?  
    **Resposta:** Eua-95 ( Interstate 95).

Alternatively, if the content mentions public transport specifically, I can ask about that instead.

I think this approach covers all necessary areas without repeating topics from the example. Each question targets a different aspect of Jacksonville's characteristics.
