Okay, I need to generate 10 questions and answers in Portuguese based on the provided context about the Normans. Let me start by reading through the context carefully to understand the key points.

First, the Normans originated from the intermingling of Norse settlers and indigenous West Franks in Normandy. They later conquered territories like England and Sicily. The term "Normans" is used for both the people and their emigrants. Rollo's agreement with King Charles III in 911 legitimized their settlement. The Norman identity evolved over centuries, blending French culture and religion. They had a significant impact on medieval Europe and the Near East. Their language, Norman French, is still spoken today. The Duchy of Normandy was a major fief of France, with dukes having independent control but being vassals to the French king. Richard I of Normandy (Richard the Fearless) helped forge it into a principality. By 996, the Normans had become French in culture, language, and customs. The Norman conquest of England led to English kings also being dukes of Normandy. Philip II of France seized Normandy in 1204, but it was ceded back in 1259. The Channel Islands are now self-governing Crown Dependencies. Their cultural and military influence spread to various regions, including the Crusader states, Scotland, Wales, Ireland, and North Africa.

Now, I need to create 10 relevant questions. Each question should be a short, direct query, and the answer should be a concise, correct response (up to 10 words). The questions should cover different aspects of the Normans: origin, historical events, cultural impact, language, political structure, and legacy.

Let me start listing possible questions:

1. What was the origin of the Normans? (Answer: Norse settlers and West Franks in Normandy)
2. When did Rollo agree to swear fealty to King Charles III? (Answer: 911)
3. What language did the Normans adopt? (Answer: French language)
4. What was the name of the duchy in the Treaty of Saint-Clair-sur-Epte? (Answer: Duchy of Normandy)
5. Who was Richard I of Normandy? (Answer: Richard the Fearless)
6. When did the Normans become French in culture? (Answer: By 996)
7. What territories were conquered by the Normans? (Answer: England, Sicily, etc.)
8. What is the current status of the Channel Islands? (Answer: Self-governing Crown Dependencies)
9. What was the main cultural contribution of the Normans? (Answer: Romanesque architecture)
10. What was the political status of the Duchy of Normandy? (Answer: Vassals to French king)

Now, I need to ensure that each answer is within 10 words. Let me check:

1. Answer: Norse settlers and West Franks in Normandy – 7 words.
2. Answer: 911 – 1 word.
3. Answer: French language – 2 words.
4. Answer: Duchy of Normandy – 3 words.

6. Answer: By 996 – 2 words.
7. Answer: England, Sicily, etc. – 3 words.
8. Answer: Self-governing Crown Dependencies – 5 words.
9. Answer: Romanesque architecture – 3 words.
10. Answer: Vassals to French king – 4 words.

All answers are under 10 words. Now, I need to phrase the questions in Portuguese, making sure they are clear and directly related to the context. Let me check each one again for accuracy and relevance.
