Okay, I need to create 10 question-answer pairs based on the provided text about the Normans. The questions should be relevant, and each answer needs to be a short phrase in Portuguese, no longer than 10 words. They should be separated by semicolons and formatted as CSV.

First, I'll read through the context carefully to identify key points that can form the basis of good questions. Let's go step by step.

The text starts with the origin of the Normans: a mix between Norse Vikings and West Franks/Gallo-Romans in Normandy. That's a solid point for the first question.

Next, it mentions Rollo and the year 911 when he swore fealty to Charles III after the siege of Chartres. So that's another key fact.

The text also talks about the Norman language evolving from Old Norse into Norman French, which is still spoken in some areas today. That can be a third question about their language.

Then there's the expansion beyond Normandy, mentioning England and Sicily as examples. A question about where they expanded would fit here.

Richard I of Normandy, known as "Richard sans Peur," forged the Duchy into a cohesive principality. So a question about his nickname is appropriate.

The Norman conquest of England in 1066 under William the Conqueror is another major event. That's a good fifth question.

Their cultural influences include Romanesque architecture and music, which can be a sixth question.

Religious aspect: they were known for their Catholic piety, becoming exponents of orthodoxy among Romance communities. So seventh question on that.

Philip II took mainland Normandy in 1204, leading to disputes until the Treaty of Paris in 1259. That's good for a question about when France seized it.

Lastly, the Channel Islands are the last remnants of the Duchy today. So tenth question about where they're considered remnants.

Now I'll structure each as a question and concise answer.
