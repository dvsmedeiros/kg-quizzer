Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs in Portuguese based on the given context about the Normans. Let me start by reading through the context carefully to identify key points.

First, the Normans originated from Norse Vikings intermixing with West Franks and Gallo-Romans. That's a good starting point for a question. Then, Rollo's agreement with King Charles III in 911 legitimized the settlements. Another key point is the Duchy of Normandy's status as a fief of France and the vassal relationship with the French king.

The Norman conquest of England in 1066 is another major event. The Channel Islands being remnants of the Duchy of Normandy is important too. Their cultural aspects like Romanesque architecture and military innovations, such as the Battle of Hastings, should be covered.

I need to ensure each question is relevant and the answers are concise, under 10 words. Let me list possible questions:

1. What was the origin of the Normans?
2. Who legitimized the Norse settlements in Normandy?
3. What was the status of the Duchy of Normandy?
4. When did the Norman conquest of England occur?
5. Which islands are remnants of the Duchy of Normandy?
6. What language did the Normans adopt?
7. What was the result of the Treaty of Paris in 1259?
8. Who founded the Principality of Antioch?
9. What architectural style is associated with the Normans?
10. What was the role of the Normans in the Iberian Reconquista?

Now, checking the context for accuracy. The answer to question 1 is the intermingling of Norse Vikings, West Franks, and Gallo-Romans. Rollo's agreement with King Charles III in 911 is correct. The Duchy was a great fief of France. The conquest was in 1066. The Channel Islands are the remnants. They adopted Gallo-Romance. The Treaty of Paris ceded the Duchy to France, except the islands. Bohemond I founded Antioch. Romanesque architecture. Their role in the Reconquista from 11th to 13th centuries.

I need to make sure answers are concise and in Portuguese. Also, check for any other key points like the Norman identity evolving over centuries, their influence in Sicily, and the languages still spoken today. Maybe include a question on the languages spoken in Normandy today. But the user asked for 10 pairs, so I need to pick the most important ones. Let me finalize the list and format them correctly in CSV.
