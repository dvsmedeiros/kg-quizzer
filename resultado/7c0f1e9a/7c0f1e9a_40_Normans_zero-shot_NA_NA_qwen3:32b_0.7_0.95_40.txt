Okay, I need to generate 10 pairs of questions and answers based on the given context about the Normans. Let's start by reading through the context carefully to identify key points.

First, the Normans were a mix of Norse Vikings and Frankish/Gallo-Roman people. The first question could be about their origin. The answer would be the intermingling between Norse settlers and West Franks/Gallo-Romans.

Next, Rollo swearing fealty to King Charles III in 911 after the siege of Chartres is a key event. That's a good question about the legitimization of the Norse settlements.

The Duchy of Normandy was established via the Treaty of Saint-Clair-sur-Epte. That's another point for a question and answer.

The Norman conquest of England in 1066 by William the Conqueror is a major historical event. The Battle of Hastings is central here.

The Norman language, Old Norman dialect, is important. The question could be about the language they adopted.

Cultural and military impact, like Romanesque architecture and the Crusader states, are mentioned. The Principality of Antioch by Bohemond I is a key example.

The loss of mainland Normandy by Philip II in 1204 and the Treaty of Paris in 1259 are significant political events.

The Channel Islands as remnants of the Duchy today should be included.

Also, the Norman influence in Sicily under Roger II and their role in the Iberian Reconquista are notable.

I need to make sure each question is concise, the answers are short (under 10 words), and in Portuguese. Let me structure each pair step by step, ensuring they cover different aspects of the context without overlapping.
