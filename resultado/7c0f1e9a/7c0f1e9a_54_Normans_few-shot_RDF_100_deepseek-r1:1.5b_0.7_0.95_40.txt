Okay, let me try to figure out how to approach this problem. The user provided a detailed list of contexts and instructions, and the task is to create a CSV based on those. 

First, I need to understand what the user wants exactly from the context files. From the examples given in each context, it seems that each context has information related to a specific topic or subject. My job is to extract relevant data points from each context into rows of a CSV file.

Looking at the instructions, it says to "Gere agora o CSV conforme Instruções e Regras." That translates to creating a CSV with specific columns and following given rules. The user also provided examples of what the CSV should look like in different contexts, which gives me an idea of how to structure the final file.

I notice that each context has multiple sections, but not all necessarily contain data for the CSV. For instance, Context 1 seems to be about a character named "Vítor," and there's no information on him, so that row should be empty. Similarly, some contexts might have placeholders or non-essential information.

I need to identify which parts of each context contribute to the CSV columns: author name, year, place, etc. Each context may cover different topics, but only certain ones provide necessary data for the CSV. For example, Context 2 about "Português" likely has the year and country, so those two would be relevant.

I should also pay attention to any placeholders or non-essential information in each context, as they shouldn't affect the CSV's structure unless there's no corresponding data. This way, the CSV remains clean and accurate without unnecessary entries.

Now, I'll go through each context one by one:

1. **Context 1**: Contains a character named "Vítor." No author year or place is provided, so that row should be empty.
2. **Context 2**: About "Português." Provides Year (1673) and Place (Lisbon, Portugal). So two rows here.
3. **Context 3**: Discusses the use of apples in architecture. No relevant data for CSV columns, so no entries.
4. **Context 4**: Details on "Português" again, with Year 1673 and Place Paris. Two rows.
5. **Context 5**: Talk about architecture (architectona normanda). No specific data, empty row.
6. **Context 6**: Discusses the role of architects in architecture. No data for CSV columns, so nothing added.
7. **Context 7**: Provides details on architecture in the period of interest. No relevant info.
8. **Context 8**: About "Português." Year 1673 and Placeantes, Portugal. Two rows.
9. **Context 9**: Discusses engineering in architecture. No data, empty row.
10. **Context 10**: Talk about architecture (architectona normanda). No specific info.
11. **Context 11**: Details on the role of architects in architecture. No data, empty.
12. **Context 12**: Discusses engineering in architecture. No relevant information.
13. **Context 13**: Provides details on "Português." Year 1674 and Placeantes. Two rows.
14. **Context 14**: Discusses architectural schools. No data, empty row.
15. **Context 15**: Talk about the role of architects in architecture. No info.
16. **Context 16**: Details on "Português." Year 1674 and Placeantes. Two rows.
17. **Context 17**: Discusses engineering in architecture. No data, empty.
18. **Context 18**: Talk about the role of architects in architecture. No info.
19. **Context 19**: Discusss engineering in architecture. No relevant information.

After going through each context, I realize that only contexts 2 and 4 provide data for the CSV columns. Contexts 3 and others lack necessary information. Therefore, my final CSV should have two rows:
- [Vítor] - 1673, Lisbon
- [Português] - 1673, Paris

I'll structure this into a CSV with headers "Author Name," "Year," and "Place." Each row will be separated by a comma. Since contexts 2 and 4 are about Portuguese, they both fit under the same header.

I should also ensure that there's no placeholder or extra information outside of the provided data. Everything must align correctly to maintain the integrity of the CSV.

CSV:

```csv
Author Name,Year,Place
Vítor - 1673, Lisbon
Português - 1673, Paris
