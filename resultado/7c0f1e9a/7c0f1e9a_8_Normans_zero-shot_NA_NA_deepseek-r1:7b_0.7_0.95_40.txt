Okay, so I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs based on the provided context about Normans. The user has given me a specific structure and format to follow, which is a CSV file with each line being "pergunta;resposta". Each question should be relevant to the context, and the answers should be short, up to 10 words long in Portuguese.

First, I'll read through the entire context about Normans to understand the key points. The context talks about the origin of Normans from Norse Vikings and Frankish people, their identity over time, political impact on medieval Europe and the Near East, cultural influences like architecture and music, military achievements, and their influence in various regions including France, England, Sicily, etc.

Now, I need to come up with 10 questions. Each question should target a different aspect of the Norman history or characteristics mentioned. Let me go through each point and think about what could be a good question for each.

1. Origin: How did the Normans arise? So maybe "O Normais surgiram de um intelectualismo entre quais populações?"

2. Language: The Norman language evolved from which Romance language dialects? That would be "De qual língua romance os Norman herdaram a língua normal?".

3. Identity: When did the Norman identity first appear? Looking at the context, it was in the first half of the 10th century, so "Quando surgiu a identidade Norman?" with answer "Primeiro semi-século do século X."

4. Impact on culture and military: The Norman dynasty had significant cultural and military influence. So maybe "Qual o impacto da dinastia normana em culture e mamental?"

5. Relationship with the Church: They were known for being Catholic. "Os Normais eram famousos por serem exponents de que?" Answer: "Orthodoxia católica."

6. Settlers' languages: The settlers adopted which language? From the context, it's Norman French, so "Onde Norman French surgeu da língua de quem?" with answer "da França românca dos pases norvegianos."

7. Relationship with France: They were vassals to the King of France under Richard I. So question could be about the duchy's relationship, maybe "O duchado de Normandia como fíe de qual monarca?" Answer: "O Rei de França."

8. Medical aspect: The context mentions they adopted French language and customs but not sure if it touches on medical practices. Wait, looking back, the context says they adopted Gallo-Romance language and became Frenchmen. Maybe a question about their social customs or something else related to France.

Wait, perhaps another angle: their relationship with the Church. We already covered that. Maybe another one is about their identity merging with Frankish population, so "Os Norman se integraram com a população galica e românca?" Answer: "Sim."

Wait, but I need 10 questions, and some might be too similar. Alternatively, maybe something about the cultural influence beyond France.

But let's stick to the context given.

Let me check each of my initial points:

1. Origin: Correct.
2. Language: Correct.
3. Identity: Correct.
4. Impact on culture and military: Correct.
5. Relationship with the Church: Correct.
6. Settlers' languages origin: Correct.
7. Relationship with France: Correct.

I need 3 more questions beyond that, so maybe:

8. When were they expelled from Sicily? The context mentions Philip II of France seized Normandy and took the Channel Islands in 1259, but it doesn't say anything about Sicily. Wait, the passage says that after the Norman conquest of England at Hastings, Philip II of France seized mainland Normandy by force of arms... It remained a disputed territory until the Treaty of Paris of 1259 when the English sovereign ceded his claim to the Duchy except for Channel Islands. It mentions Sicily is an example.

Wait, but in the context provided, it doesn't directly say that Norman adventurers founded the Kingdom of Sicily after Roger II. Let me check:

"In the present day, the Channel Islands (the Bailiwick of Guernsey and the Bailiwick of Jersey) are considered to be officially the last remnants of the Duchy of Normandy, and are not part of the United Kingdom but are instead self-governing Crown Dependencies."

Wait, no mention about Sicily. So perhaps that's an error in my initial question.

Alternatively, maybe I should focus on another point. Perhaps their military innovations: "Os Norman foram famousos por serem exponents de que?" But that's similar to the church question.

Alternatively, their influence in various regions: "O influência dos Normans se estendia para quais terras?" Answer: "Francesa, Inglês, Sicília, Espana e Canadá."

Wait, but looking at the context:

"Influência cultural e militar": yes, spreading to Near East and regions in Europe. Specific mentions of founding Antioch in Levant, contributions to Iberian Reconquista, Prince Bohemond founded Principality of Antioch, Norman forces in England, etc.

So maybe a question about their spread: "O influência dos Normans se estendia para quais terras?" Answer: "Francesa, Inglês, Sicília e Canadá."

Wait, but in the context, it's written as "Norman cultural and military influence spread from these new European centres to the Crusader states of the Near East..." So it includes Crusader states (Levant), Europe,Near East, etc. So perhaps a better answer would be: "Francesa, Inglês, Sicília e Canadá."

But I think that's stretching, as the context doesn't explicitly mention Canadá.

Alternatively, maybe stick with known areas mentioned like France, England, Sicily, Spain, and Quebec or the Channel Islands. But since the answer should be short, perhaps "Francesa, Inglês e Sicília."

Hmm.

Wait, in my initial list, I have 7 questions so far:

1-6 as above plus question about identity and 7 about relationship with France. So need three more.

Maybe:

8. When were they expelled from Sicily? But context doesn't mention it, so perhaps better to stick with known areas.

Alternatively, another aspect: the Norman language's literary influence in parts of Mainland Normandy (Cotentinais) and Channel Islands.

So maybe "Os Norman línguas literárias se difundiram para quais terras?" Answer: "Portugal e Canadá."

Wait, no, Cotentinais is in France. Channel Islands are in the Channel, so perhaps "Francesa e Canadá."

Alternatively, I can think of their impact on different regions.

But to avoid overcomplicating, maybe stick with the points mentioned and adjust where necessary.

So here's a better approach:

1. Origin: Norman arose from Norse and Frankish populations.
2. Language: adopted Gallo-Romance dialects.
3. Identity: first half of 10th century.
4. Impact on culture and military: significant cultural and military influence.
5. Relationship with the Church: exponents of Catholic orthodoxy.
6. Settlers' languages origin: from França românca dos pases norvegianos.
7. Relationship with France: vassals under Richard I.
8. Influence on culture and language spread to: Francesa, Inglês e Sicília.
9. Military achievements: famous for innovations in battle.
10. Cultural influence: unique Romanesque architecture.

Wait, but point 8 is too broad. Maybe more specific.

Alternatively:

8. When did they conquer England? Answer: "No Battle of Hastings (1066)."

But that's already covered by question about their relationship with France.

Hmm.

Alternatively, how did their language evolve?

So maybe change the first few questions to better fit each point without overlapping too much.

Wait, perhaps I should prioritize the most important aspects based on the context and ensure each question is unique and relevant. Let me re-express:

1. Origin of Normans: from Norse Vikings and Frankish people.
2. Language origin: adopted Gallo-Romance dialects.
3. Identity period: first half of 10th century.
4. Cultural impact: significant influence on Europe and Near East.
5. Relationship with Church: exponents of Catholic orthodoxy.
6. Settlers' language source: França românca dos pases norvegianos.
7. Relationship with France: vassals under Richard I, leading to their expulsion in 1204.
8. Spread regions: mainly France, England, Sicily.
9. Military influence: famous for innovations like the Normans' victory at Hastings.
10. Cultural architecture: unique Romanesque styles.

Wait, but point 7 is about being expelled from France (Normandy), which aligns with the duchy's vassalage until 1259.

So maybe questions:

1. Origin
2. Language origin
3. Identity time period
4. Cultural impact
5. Relationship with Church
6. Settlers' language source
7. Relationship with France (duchy status)
8. Spread regions
9. Military influence
10. Cultural architecture

Yes, that makes sense.

So finalizing the 10 questions as:

1. O Norman surgiu de um intelectualismo entre quais populações?
2. De qual língua romance os Norman herdaram a língua normal?
3. Quando surgiu a identidade Norman?
4. Qual o impacto da dinastia normana em culture e mamental?
5. Os Normais eram famousos por serem exponents de que?
6. Os Norman French surgeu da língua de quem?
7. O duchado de Normandia como fíe de qual monarca?
8. Em quais terras o influência dos Normans se estendia?
9. Os Norman foram famousos por serem exponents de que?
10. Quais tipos de construçõesUnique Norman têram?
