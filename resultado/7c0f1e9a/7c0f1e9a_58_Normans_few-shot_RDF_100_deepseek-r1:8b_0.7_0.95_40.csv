And so on. Each of these points seems to be individual facts that should become separate rows in the CSV. Additionally; there are some context points at the end that provide further details about certain aspects like art and architecture.
40-41: These seem to be additional notes on specific topics; possibly related to the context provided earlier.
And so on. If there's additional context or related information provided after a fact; it should be included in the "Additional Context" column.
Next; I'll go through each numbered point systematically:
7: Norman influence extended to literature; with works by authors like Geoffrey Chaucer.

18: The Norman navy was a significant force; controlling trade routes and coastal areas.
20. The Norman-Sicilian kingdom became a cultural crossroads; blending influences from multiple regions.
21. The Norman Conquest affected English language; leading to Norman French influence.
22. Feudal barons gained power under Norman rule; creating complex social hierarchies.
24. Norman bishops supported the development of cathedrals; blending Romanesque with local styles.

One potential issue I foresee is handling commas within the "Fact" column without causing formatting issues in the CSV. If a fact contains a comma that isn't meant to separate fields; it should be enclosed in quotes. For instance:
In summary; my approach is:
5. Ensure that if a fact contains commas; they are handled appropriately to prevent misinterpretation.
Now; I'll proceed to create the CSV accordingly.
