Okay, so I need to generate 10 question-response pairs based on the provided context about steam engines. Let me start by reading through the context carefully to understand the key points.

The context explains that a steam engine is a heat engine using steam as its working fluid. It converts thermal energy into mechanical work via pistons and cylinders, connected to a crank for rotation. It's an external combustion engine, different from steam turbines. The Rankine cycle is the ideal thermodynamic model. 

Historically, early devices like the aeolipile existed, but Jerónimo de Ayanz patented the first steam-powered water pump in 1606. Thomas Savery made it commercially viable with a steam pump using steam pressure directly on water. Newcomen's engine was the first to provide continuous power in 1712. James Watt improved efficiency by condensing steam separately, leading to broader industrial use.

In the 19th century, stationary engines powered factories, ships used paddle steamers, and railways had steam locomotives. Reciprocating piston engines dominated until the early 20th century when electric motors and internal combustion engines took over. Steam turbines later replaced reciprocating engines due to cost, speed, and efficiency.

Now, I need to create 10 questions with short answers in Portuguese. Each question should target a specific fact or definition from the context.

Let me list potential topics:
1. What is a steam engine?
2. How does it convert energy?
3. Who improved Watt's engine?
4. When was Newcomen's engine developed?
5. Who patented the first steam pump?
6. What cycle is used for analysis?
7. Difference between steam engine and turbine.
8. What replaced sails in ships?
9. Why were steam engines efficient?
10. What ended their dominance?

Wait, I need to ensure each question is clear and the answer is concise.

Let me structure them one by one:

1. **What does a steam engine convert?** Answer: Energia térmica para trabalho mecânico.
2. **How is mechanical work generated in a steam engine?** Answer: Força da pressão do vapor em um cilindro.
3. **What connects the piston's linear motion to rotation?** Answer: Lábia e manivela.
4. **Name an early steam device mentioned.** Answer: Aeolipile.
5. **Who patented the first steam-powered water pump in 1606?** Answer: Jerónimo de Ayanz y Beaumont.
6. **What is the term for a steam-powered machine using direct pressure on water?** Answer: Bomba de vapor de Thomas Savery.
7. **When was Newcomen's engine developed?** Answer: Em 1712.
8. **Who made a critical improvement in 1764?** Answer: James Watt.
9. **What thermodynamic cycle is used for analysis?** Answer: Ciclo Rankine.
10. **What replaced sails on ships?** Answer: Vapor em barcos a vapor.

I should check if the answers are correct based on the context. For example, question 3 mentions connecting rod and crank as the mechanism, but the answer I provided uses 'lábia e manivela,' which is Portuguese for connecting rod and crank. That's accurate.

Another point: Question 5 correctly names Jerónimo de Ayanz y Beaumont as the one who patented in 1606. The context does mention him, so that's correct.

I think this covers all necessary aspects of the context. Now, I'll format them into a CSV with the specified semicolon separator.
