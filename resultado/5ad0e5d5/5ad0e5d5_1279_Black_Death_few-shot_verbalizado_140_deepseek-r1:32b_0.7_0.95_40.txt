Okay, so I need to generate a quiz based on the Black Death information provided. Let's start by understanding what's needed.

First, the user wants 10 question-answer pairs in Portuguese, each separated by a semicolon. The questions should be varied and cover different aspects of the Black Death as detailed in the context and facts provided.

Looking at the context, it mentions that the Black Death occurred from 1346 to 1353, killed between 75–200 million people, was caused by Yersinia pestis spread by fleas on black rats, and had significant impacts on Europe's population and history. It also notes some uncertainties about its origin, with recent discoveries suggesting it might not have been solely due to Mongol conquests.

The facts section includes various details like the disease type (bubonic plague), key figures involved (Ole Jørgen Benedictow, Sharon N. DeWitte), and related categories such as health disasters and pandemics.

I need to ensure each question is unique and covers different aspects: origin, spread, impact, causes, duration, etc. Also, the answers must be concise and directly from the context or facts.

Let me outline possible questions:

1. When did the Black Death occur?
2. What's the primary cause of the disease?
3. Which bacteria causes it?
4. How was it mainly transmitted?
5. How much of Europe's population was affected?
6. What regions were affected besides Europe?
7. Was it the first plague pandemic?
8. How long did the global impact last?
9. Did it affect other regions outside Eurasia and Africa?
10. Which flea species is a vector?

Now, I'll structure each as per instructions, ensuring Portuguese language and correct answers.

I should double-check each answer against the context to ensure accuracy. For example, the spread to North Africa and Middle East is mentioned, so question 6 can include that.

Also, note that the Black Death was part of the second plague pandemic, so question 7's answer is no.

Lastly, ensuring variety in topics covered, from causes to impacts, ensures comprehensive coverage.
