Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs in Portuguese based on the given context about the Normans. Let me start by reading through the context and the triples to gather key information.

First, the context mentions that the Normans were a people from the Duchy of Normandy, formed by Norse Vikings and Frankish people. They conquered places like England and Sicily. Important dates include the 10th century for their identity formation and the Treaty of Saint-Clair-sur-Epte. Key figures are Rollo, Richard the Fearless, William the Conqueror. Their language was Old Norman, and they adopted Christianity. The Channel Islands are the last remnants of the Duchy. Also, they had a significant impact on medieval Europe and the Near East.

Now, looking at the triples, there's info on their religion (Norse paganism initially, then Christianity), their language (Old Norman, Latin, Old Norse), locations (Duchy of Normandy, Channel Islands), and events (Battle of Hastings, Norman conquest of England). Also, they built castles like Waytemore and Greenmount Motte.

I need to make sure each question is unique and covers different aspects. Let's brainstorm possible questions:

1. Where did the Normans originate? (Duchy of Normandy)
2. When did the Norman identity form? (10th century)
3. Who was the leader who swore fealty to the Frankish king? (Rollo)
4. What language did they speak? (Old Norman, Latin, Old Norse)
5. Which territories did they conquer? (England, Sicily)
6. What was their religion? (Christianity, Norse paganism)
7. What is the last remaining part of the Duchy? (Channel Islands)
8. Who was the Duke during the Battle of Hastings? (William the Conqueror)
9. What architectural style did they use? (Romanesque)
10. When did the Duchy lose mainland Normandy? (1204, Philip II)

Wait, need to check the context for exact answers. For example, the answer to the origin is the Duchy of Normandy. The identity formed in the 10th century. Rollo is the leader. Their language includes Old Norman. Conquered England and Sicily. Religion transitioned from Norse paganism to Christianity. Channel Islands are the remnants. William the Conqueror was the Duke. Architectural style is Romanesque. The Duchy was taken in 1204.

Now, formulating the questions in Portuguese, keeping answers concise. Need to avoid repetition. Let me check the example given to match the style. The answers should be short, up to 10 words. Also, ensure that the answers are inferable from the context.

Final check: 10 pairs, each with a unique question, correct answer, and in the right format.
