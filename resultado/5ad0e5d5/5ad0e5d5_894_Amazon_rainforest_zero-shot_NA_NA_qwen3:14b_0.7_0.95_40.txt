Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs based on the provided context about the Amazon rainforest. Let me start by reading through the context carefully to identify key points.

First, the Amazon covers 7,000,000 km², with 5,500,000 km² as rainforest. That's a good fact for a question. Then, it spans nine nations and has 3,344 indigenous territories. Brazil has 60%, Peru 13%, Colombia 10%, and others. The name "Amazonas" is used by four nations, and France's "Guiana Amazonian Park" is another point. The Amazon has over half of the world's remaining rainforests, 390 billion trees, 16,000 species. Also, 30 million people from 350 ethnic groups live there, with 9% being indigenous, and 60 groups isolated.

Now, I'll need to create questions that cover these facts. Let's list possible questions:

1. What is the total area of the Amazon basin?
2. How many countries does the Amazon span?
3. Which country has the largest portion of the Amazon?
4. What percentage of the Amazon is in Brazil?
5. How many indigenous territories are formally acknowledged?
6. How many species of trees are estimated in the Amazon?
7. What is the name of France's rainforest protected area?
8. How many people live in the Amazon?
9. How many ethnic groups are present in the Amazon?
10. What percentage of the Amazon's population is indigenous?

Now, check if the answers are accurate and concise. Let me verify each answer against the context. For example, the total area is 7,000,000 km². The Amazon spans nine nations. Brazil has 60%, so that's correct. Indigenous territories are 3,344. Tree species are 16,000. France's protected area is "Guiana Amazonian Park." 30 million people, 350 ethnic groups, 9% indigenous. That all matches the context. Now, format these into CSV with semicolons and ensure the answers are under 10 words each.
