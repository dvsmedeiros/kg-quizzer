Okay, so I need to create a quiz based on knowledge of the Normans, right? The user provided some context about the Normans and specified that each question should be relevant in Portuguese. Let me break this down.

First, I'll look at the context given. It's pretty detailed about what the Normans were, their history, culture, and influence across various regions. My task is to generate 10 pairs of questions and answers, structured as a CSV file with each question followed by its correct answer.

I should make sure that each question is clear and the corresponding answer is concise, within 10 words. Since it's in Portuguese, I need to ensure proper grammar and vocabulary related to the Normans.

Let me think about key points from the context:

1. Origin of the Normans: They arose in the Duchy of Normandy, which was a medieval fief. So, one question could be about the origin of the Norman duchy.

2. Key figures: Rollo, a Scandinavian Viking leader, legitimized the Norman identity after Chartres sieges. That can form another question.

3. Cultural aspects: Their language evolved to Norman, which is already mentioned as a key point. Another question could focus on their linguistic changes.

4. Historical events: The Normans were involved in conquering England, Italy, and Malta. So, perhaps a question about the first English knight after Chartres.

5. Impact regions: They influenced France, England, Spain, etc., particularly through the Iberian Reconquista. Maybe a question on their influence on Spain.

6. Influence areas: They spread to Antioch in the Levant and Scotland/Great Britain. Perhaps a question about their impact on these regions.

7. Maintenance of duchy: Philip II seized Normandy despite English claims. This could be another question.

8. Cultural practices: The normative Romanesque architecture with musical traditions is key. Maybe a question about architecture or music.

9. Military achievements: They were军事上的伟大，这个可以作为另一个题目。

10. Legacy: Their legacy continues through various languages and cultures. Perhaps a question on the legacy of their influence.

Wait, I think that's 10 points. Let me make sure each is distinct and relevant to the context provided.

I should also ensure the questions are in Portuguese and the answers are correct. For example, the origin of the Norman duchy as a medieval fief, language becoming Norman after Chartres sieges, musical traditions etc.

Let me structure them:

1. Para que haja o duchy normão.
2. O fundão da duchada normão é...
3. Três dos dosadistas normão foi Rollo.
4. Na firstly de conquista de England, um dos dosadistas wasp.
5. O duchado normão se segurou para Philip II.
6. Leis normaes es esforzaron na influência à norvegia.
7. Três das influências da Norma são...
8. Para que haja o duchado normão do Norão.
9. Em seu topo, um dos dosadistas dos Normões é...
10. Leis normaes es esforzaron na influência àIRELLA.

I think that covers all the key aspects mentioned in the context without being too repetitive. Each question targets a specific element of the Normans' history or culture.
