Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the provided context and facts. The context is about imperialism, and the facts are a list of various triples related to it.

First, I need to make sure I understand the context. The abstract says imperialism involves extending power through territorial acquisition, political control, economic control, using hard and soft power. It's distinct from colonialism and empire, applying to other forms of expansion and government.

Now, looking at the facts. There's a lot of information here. For example, models used by the Wikipedia page on imperialism, associated parties like Canadian Party and Alliance for National Reconstruction, historical events like Japanese war crimes and Herero and Namaqua genocide, images related to various empires, and people like Wolfgang Mommsen and Michael Parenti who have interests in imperialism.

I need to create varied and comprehensive questions. Each question should relate to the context and have a single answer from the facts. Let's brainstorm possible questions.

1. What is a key characteristic of imperialism? (Answer from the abstract: extending power through territorial acquisition, etc.)
2. Which political parties are associated with imperialism? (Canadian Party, Progressive Party, etc.)
3. What models are used in the Wikipedia page on imperialism? (Template:Authoritarian types of rule, etc.)
4. Which historical events are motivated by imperialism? (Japanese war crimes, Herero and Namaqua genocide)
5. What are the two main types of power used in imperialism? (Hard and soft power)
6. Which books focus on imperialism as a non-fiction subject? (Culture and Imperialism, Settlers: The Mythology of the White Proletariat)
7. What images are associated with imperialism? (Roman Empire Map.png, Japanese Empire map, etc.)
8. What is an example of a formal type of imperialism? (Colonial domination, territorial acquisition)
9. Which countries' empires are depicted in the images? (British Empire, Spanish Empire, etc.)
10. Who are notable scholars or authors associated with imperialism? (Wolfgang Mommsen, Michael Parenti)

Now, checking if the answers are inferable from the context or facts. The abstract gives the definitions, and the facts provide specific examples. Need to make sure answers are concise and within 10 words. Also, avoid repeating similar questions. Let me structure them properly in CSV format with semicolons.
