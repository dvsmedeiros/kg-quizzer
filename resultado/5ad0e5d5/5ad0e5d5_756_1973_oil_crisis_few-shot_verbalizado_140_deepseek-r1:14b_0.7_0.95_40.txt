Okay, so I need to create a CSV file with 10 pairs of questions and answers based on the given context about the 1973 oil crisis. The user provided an example, which is helpful, but I should make sure each question is unique and covers different aspects of the topic. Let me start by carefully reading through the context to understand the key points.

The context mentions that the 1973 oil crisis began in October 1973 when OAPEC countries led by Saudi Arabia imposed an embargo targeting nations supporting Israel during the Yom Kippur War. The targeted countries included the US, Canada, UK, Japan, and others. The embargo lasted until March 1974, causing a significant increase in oil prices—nearly 300% globally, reaching almost $12 per barrel.

Additionally, the crisis had various impacts on global politics and economies. It's noted as the first oil shock, followed by the 1979 crisis. The context also mentions that Nixon's government negotiated with non-cooperating countries by pressuring Israel to withdraw from the Sinai and Golan Heights, leading to a withdrawal agreement signed in January 1974.

Looking at the "Fatos" section, there are many details about the event's categorization and related topics, but perhaps more useful are the specific events and dates mentioned. For example, the oil price increase, the duration of the embargo, the countries involved, and the aftermath like Nixon's policies.

Now, I'll brainstorm potential questions that can be derived from this information:

1. When did the 1973 oil crisis begin?
2. Which countries were targeted by the oil embargo?
3. What was the main reason for the oil embargo?
4. How much did oil prices increase during the crisis?
5. Who led the Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries (OAPEC) during the embargo?
6. When was the oil embargo lifted?
7. What action did Nixon's government take to resolve the crisis?
8. Which countries were forced to withdraw their troops under Nixon's negotiations?
9. What was a direct consequence of the oil price hike on global markets?
10. How many months did the oil embargo last?

Wait, some of these might be too similar or not directly covered in the context. I should ensure each question is unique and directly relates to the provided information.

Let me check:

- The crisis started in October 1973.
- Targeted countries: Canada, Japan, UK, US, etc.
- Reason: Support for Israel during Yom Kippur War.
- Oil prices increased nearly 300%, reaching almost $12 per barrel globally; US prices were higher.
- Saudi Arabia led OAPEC.
- Embargo ended in March 1974.
- Nixon negotiated by pressuring Israel to withdraw from Sinai and Golan Heights.
- Agreement signed on January 18, 1974, leading to withdrawal.
- The price hike caused economic and political impacts globally.
- Duration: From October 1973 to March 1974, so about 5 months.

Now, translating these points into varied questions:

1. When did the 1973 oil crisis begin?
2. Which countries were targeted by the OAPEC embargo?
3. Why was the oil embargo imposed in 1973?
4. What was the percentage increase in oil prices during the crisis?
5. Who led the OAPEC during the embargo?
6. When did the oil embargo end?
7. How did Nixon's government respond to the crisis?
8. What territories were Israel pressured to withdraw from?
9. By how much did oil prices rise globally by the end of the embargo?
10. How long lasted the 1973 oil embargo?

Wait, some questions might overlap or not provide unique insights. Let me refine them:

1. When did the 1973 oil crisis begin?
2. Which countries were targeted by the OAPEC embargo?
3. What was the main reason for the 1973 oil embargo?
4. What was the percentage increase in oil prices during the crisis?
5. Who led the group that imposed the oil embargo?
6. When was the oil embargo lifted?
7. How did Nixon's government negotiate with non-cooperating countries?
8. What territories were Israel forced to withdraw from under the agreement?
9. What was the global price of oil by the end of the crisis?
10. How many months did the 1973 oil embargo last?

This seems better, covering different aspects without repeating similar questions.

Now, I need to ensure that each answer is concise and directly supported by the context or can be inferred from it. Let me structure them:

1. When did the 1973 oil crisis begin? October 1973
2. Which countries were targeted by the OAPEC embargo? Canada, Japan, UK, US, Portugal, Rhodesia, South Africa
3. What was the main reason for the 1973 oil embargo? Support for Israel during Yom Kippur War
4. What was the percentage increase in oil prices? Nearly 300%
5. Who led the group that imposed the oil embargo? Saudi Arabia led OAPEC
6. When was the oil embargo lifted? March 1974
7. How did Nixon's government negotiate with non-cooperating countries? Pressured Israel to withdraw from Sinai and Golan Heights
8. What territories were Israel forced to withdraw from under the agreement? Sinai Peninsula and Golan Heights
9. What was the global price of oil by the end of the crisis? Nearly US $12 per barrel
10. How many months did the 1973 oil embargo last? Approximately 5 months (from October 1973 to March 1974)

I think this covers a good range of topics, ensuring variety and depth.
