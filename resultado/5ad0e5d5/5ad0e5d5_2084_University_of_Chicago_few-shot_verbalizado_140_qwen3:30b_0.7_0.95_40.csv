Okay; I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the given context and facts. Let me start by understanding the requirements.
8. How many students are enrolled? (Answer: 18;452)
I need to ensure that the answers are directly from the context or facts. Also; avoid repetition. Let me structure each pair:
But the user's example answer for a similar question is "departamento de física de Chicago". So maybe the answer here is "laboratório de metallurgia da universidade". However; the user's example might have a typo or different context. But I have to stick to the given context.
Another point: the facts list has "University of Chicago possui ranking USNWR mundial 15" and "University of Chicago possui ranking USNWR numérico 6". So the answer for the USNWR numerical ranking is 6; and the worldwide ranking is 15. So two different questions could be: "Qual é o ranking mundial da Universidade de Chicago no USNWR?" (15) and "Qual é o ranking numérico da Universidade de Chicago no USNWR?" (6). That's two different questions.
