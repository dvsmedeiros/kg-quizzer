Okay, so the user is asking me to generate 10 pairs of questions and answers related to economic inequality based on the provided content. They also want it in a CSV format with specific separators and language.

First, I need to understand what's being requested. The user wants each question paired with a correct answer, all in one CSV file. Each line should have just two items separated by a comma. Also, the CSV must be exactly 10 lines long with appropriate separators like ; and points with vírgula (comma) as per their example.

Looking at the context provided, I see multiple sections discussing economic inequality. The key areas include definitions, statistics, causes, effects, and examples of economic disparities. My goal is to extract relevant questions from these sections and find concise answers that fit the criteria.

I need to ensure each question is unique and covers different aspects of the topic to avoid repetition. For example, asking about Gini coefficients, wealth distribution, global trends, top earners, and specific examples like the Man orb in 2008 would cover a broad range.

Each answer should be a few words, either from text snippets or brief calculations. I'll check each section for clear questions and their corresponding answers to make sure they're accurate and directly relevant.

Once I have 10 distinct questions with correct answers, I'll format them into the CSV structure as instructed. I must avoid using markdown, keep the language natural, and ensure the CSV is clean without any extra characters or formatting issues.
