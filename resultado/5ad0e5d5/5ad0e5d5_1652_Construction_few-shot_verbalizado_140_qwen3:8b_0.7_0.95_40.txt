Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the provided context and facts. Let me start by understanding the context. The context talks about construction as an industry, its processes, contributions to GDP, and some companies involved. The facts list various companies, terms, and categories related to construction.

First, I should make sure each question is unique and covers different aspects. Let me brainstorm possible questions. For example, the context mentions the contribution to GDP, so a question about that percentage would be good. The facts list many companies, so I can ask about examples of companies in the industry. Also, terms like "megaprojetos" are mentioned in the example, so maybe include that.

Wait, the example includes questions about the three things needed for construction (planning, design, financing), which are mentioned in the context. I need to avoid repeating similar questions. Let me check the facts again for other terms. There's "Tensile structure possui hiperônimo Construction" – maybe a question about what tensile structure is a hypernym of. Also, "Construction possui largura da barra 30" – maybe a question about the width of the bar for construction.

I need to ensure each answer is directly from the context or facts. Let me list possible questions and their answers:

1. What is the contribution of construction to global GDP? (Answer: 13 percent)
2. What are the three essentials for construction? (Answer: planning, design, financing)
3. What is the term for large construction projects? (Answer: megaprojetos)
4. Which company is part of the construction industry? (Answer: Saudi Binladin Group)
5. What is the term for the process of building? (Answer: construction)
6. What is the percentage of US industry fatalities in construction? (Answer: 20%)
7. What is the term for the art and science of building? (Answer: construction)
8. What is the term for the process of building and maintaining infrastructure? (Answer: construction)
9. What is the term for the process of building and maintaining infrastructure? (Wait, that's similar to 8. Need to rephrase.)
10. What is the term for the process of building and maintaining infrastructure? (Hmm, maybe use a different angle.)

Wait, the example has "megaprojetos" as the answer for the term for large projects. So I can use that. Let me check the facts again for other companies. There's "China Machinery Engineering Corporation" and "Hochtief" etc. Also, the context mentions "megaprojetos" in the example. Let me make sure each question is distinct and answers are from the facts or context.

Another point: the context says construction covers repairs, maintenance, expansion, etc. So a question about what construction includes besides building. Answer: repairs and maintenance.

Also, the context mentions the industry contributes significantly to GDP, with $11 trillion in 2023. So a question about the global expenditure on construction in 2023. Answer: $11 trillion.

Let me structure these into 10 pairs, ensuring they are varied and answers are concise.
