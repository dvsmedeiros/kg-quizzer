Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the provided context and facts. Let me start by understanding the context. The context explains that private schools are not government-funded and have their own governance systems. The facts list various schools that are private.

First, I should make sure each question is unique and covers different aspects. For example, some questions can ask for definitions, others about examples, and maybe the funding sources. Let me check the example given to see the structure. The example includes questions about names, funding, rights, etc.

I need to avoid repeating similar questions. Let me brainstorm possible questions. For instance, "What is another term for private schools?" could be answered with "independent schools." Then, maybe ask about examples like "Which school is a private school?" but the answer needs to be specific. Wait, the facts list many schools, so maybe use some of them as examples. For example, "Davao Christian High School is an example of what type of school?" with answer "Private school."

But wait, the user provided a list of schools, so maybe the questions can be about identifying the type of school. However, the example in the user's message uses the school names as answers. For example, "Juntamente com as escolas não-governamentais e não estatais, qual é o outro nome para escolas particulares?" translates to asking for another name for private schools, and the answer is "independentes." So maybe I can use similar structures.

Let me think of 10 varied questions. For example:

1. What is another term for private schools? → independent schools
2. What is the primary source of funding for private schools? → private donations
3. Which of the listed schools is a private school? → Davao Christian High School
4. What is a key characteristic of private schools? → self-governance
5. Which school is an example of a private institution? → Brookewood School
6. What distinguishes private schools from public ones? → no government funding
7. What is the governance structure of private schools? → board of governors
8. Which school is not government-funded? → Medical College of Wisconsin
9. What term describes schools not reliant on public funds? → independent
10. What is another name for a private school? → independent school

Wait, some of these might be similar. Let me check for repetition. The examples in the user's message include questions about funding, rights, and specific examples. Maybe I should vary between definitions, examples, and characteristics.

Also, the answers need to be concise, up to 10 words. Let me ensure each answer is short. For instance, "private donations" is good. For the school examples, the answer would be the school name, like "Davao Christian High School."

Now, I need to format them as CSV with semicolons. Let me list them out, making sure they are unique and cover different aspects.
