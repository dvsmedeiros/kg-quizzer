Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs in Portuguese based on the given context about Ctenophora. Let me start by reading through the context carefully to identify key points.

First, the context mentions that Ctenophora are marine invertebrates commonly known as comb jellies. That's a good starting point for a question and answer. Next, they use cilia for swimming, referred to as "combs." That's another point. Their size ranges from a few millimeters to 1.5 meters. The number of validated species is between 100-150, with possibly 25 more not fully described. The textbook examples are cydippids with egg-shaped bodies and retractable tentacles. Their body structure has a jelly mass with two-cell layers. Body forms vary, like cydippids, platyctenids, and beroids. Most are predators, except some juveniles that are parasites. Fossils date back to the early Cambrian. Their position in the tree of life is debated, with hypotheses about their evolutionary placement.

Looking at the facts provided, there are mentions of bioluminescence, specific species like Callianira hexagona and Coeloplana, and various Wikipedia templates used. The common name is "comb jellies," and they're part of the Animalia kingdom. The etymology comes from Greek words for comb and carry. They have subdivisions like Tentaculata, Nuda, and Scleroctenophora. The phylum was described by Eschscholtz in 1829. There are images associated with them, like Bathocyroe fosteri and Haeckel's illustrations.

Now, I need to form questions that cover these points without repeating. Let's list possible questions:

1. What is the common name for Ctenophora? Answer: comb jellies
2. What do Ctenophora use for swimming? Answer: groups of cilia (combs)
3. What is the size range of adult Ctenophora? Answer: a few millimeters to 1.5 m
4. How many validated species are there? Answer: 100 to 150
5. What are the textbook examples of Ctenophora? Answer: cydippids with egg-shaped bodies
6. What is the body structure of Ctenophora? Answer: jelly mass with two-cell layers
7. What are the different body forms in Ctenophora? Answer: cydippids, platyctenids, beroids
8. What is the primary diet of most Ctenophora? Answer: predators (prey from larvae to crustaceans)
9. When do fossils of Ctenophora date back to? Answer: early Cambrian (525 million years ago)
10. What is the etymology of Ctenophora? Answer: Greek for comb and carry

Checking for repetition and ensuring each answer is unique and from the context. Also, making sure answers are concise. Some facts from the triplas might not be covered, but the main context seems covered. Let me verify each answer against the context to ensure accuracy.
