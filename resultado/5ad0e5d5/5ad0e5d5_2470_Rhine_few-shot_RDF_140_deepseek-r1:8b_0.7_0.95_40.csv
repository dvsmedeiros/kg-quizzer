Okay; I need to create a CSV file based on the given instructions and rules. Let me start by understanding what's being asked.
Next; I'll go through each column one by one:
1. **ID**: It seems like there isn't a specific ID provided in the data; so maybe this can be left blank or marked as N/A.
7. **Locks**: I don't see specific lock information provided; so this might be left blank or marked as N/A.
I need to ensure that each piece of information is correctly extracted without missing any details. Also; I'll verify that all columns have appropriate data or are marked as N/A if information isn't available.
