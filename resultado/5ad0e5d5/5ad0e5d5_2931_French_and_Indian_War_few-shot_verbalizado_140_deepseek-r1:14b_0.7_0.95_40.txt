Okay, so I need to create a CSV with 10 question-answer pairs about the French and Indian War based on the provided context and triples. Let me start by understanding what's given.

The context is a detailed Wikipedia-style paragraph about the war, including when it happened, the main groups involved, key events, military forces, outcomes, etc. The triples list various facts like participants, locations, dates, casualties, etc.

I should make sure each question is unique and covers different aspects of the war. I'll go through the context to extract key points and then check the triples for additional details.

1. **Duration**: The war started in 1754, so a question about when it began makes sense.
2. **Combatants**: Both British and French were involved with their respective Native American allies.
3. **Outcome**: The Treaty of Paris ended it, which is an important fact.
4. **Casualties**: The context mentions around 1,500 deaths.
5. **Commanders**: Key figures like Edward Braddock, James Wolfe, and William Johnson are mentioned.
6. **End Date**: The war concluded in 1763 with the treaty.
7. **Impact**: It led to significant changes in colonial boundaries.
8. **Military Tactics**: Use of long rifles by colonists.
9. **Key Battles**: Battles like Braddock's Defeat and Fort Oswego Siege are notable.
10. **Treaty Name**: The Treaty of Paris is the main outcome.

I need to phrase these as questions and answers, making sure they're clear and concise. I'll avoid any overlap and ensure each question targets a different aspect. Let me structure them one by one.

Now, putting it all together into the CSV format with proper escaping for quotes if needed.
