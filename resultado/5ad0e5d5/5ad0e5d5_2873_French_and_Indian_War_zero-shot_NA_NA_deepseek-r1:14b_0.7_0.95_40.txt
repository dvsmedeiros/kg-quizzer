Okay, so I need to generate 10 question-response pairs based on the provided context about the French and Indian War. The output should be a CSV with each line containing a question and answer separated by a semicolon. Let me start by reading through the context carefully to understand the key points.

The context mentions several important aspects: it was part of the Seven Years' War, involved British and French colonies in North America,Native American tribes on both sides, population differences between British and French settlers, significant events like the Battle of Jumonville Glen, George Washington's involvement, Braddock's defeat, expulsion of Acadians, key battles, and the eventual outcome with France losing most of its territories.

I should identify major topics here. Let's see:

1. The war as part of the Seven Years' War.
2. The opposing sides: British vs French colonies.
3. Population numbers between the two colonial powers.
4. Dependence on Native American allies for both sides.
5. Key battles and events, like Jumonville Glen and Braddock's defeat.
6. Deportation of Acadians.
7. Capture of Fort Duquesne and Pittsburgh.
8. British campaign to capture Canada, including Quebec and Montreal.
9. Treaty of Paris outcomes.

Now, I need to frame questions around these points, ensuring each question is clear and the answer is concise. Let me list out potential questions:

1. What was the French and Indian War part of?
   - Answer: The Seven Years' War

2. Which European power were the British colonies opposing in North America during the war?
   - France

3. How many settlers lived in French colonies compared to British at the start?
   - Roughly 60,000 vs 2 million

4. What did the outnumbered French rely on?
   - Native American allies

5. When was the Battle of Jumonville Glen?
   - May 1754

6. Who led the Virginia militiamen in that battle?
   - George Washington

7. What happened to Fort Duquesne later?
   - It became Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania

8. What were the British attempting to do with four-way attacks in 1755?
   - Capture French positions but failed

9. Who was expelled from Nova Scotia after the war started?
   - Acadians

10. Which year saw the capture of Quebec by the British?
    - 1759

Wait, I should check if these questions cover a range of information without overlapping too much. Maybe include some about specific events or outcomes.

I think that's a good start. Now, let me structure each question and ensure the answers are accurate based on the context.
