Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the provided context about the Normans. Let me start by reading through the context and the triples to understand the key points.

First, the context mentions that the Normans were a population in medieval Normandy from the intermingling of Norse Vikings and West Franks/Gallo-Romans. They also conquered England and Sicily. The Treaty of Saint-Clair-sur-Epte established the Duchy of Normandy. Rollo's agreement with King Charles III in 911 legitimized the settlements. The Norman identity evolved, and they adopted French language and customs. The Duchy was under Richard I, and later became part of France after Philip II seized it in 1204. The Channel Islands are remnants of the Duchy. Their cultural and military influence spread, including the Norman conquest of England in 1066 and the Battle of Hastings.

Looking at the triples, there's information about various battles, places, and people associated with the Normans, as well as their languages, religions, and historical events.

Now, I need to create varied questions that cover different aspects. Let me brainstorm possible questions:

1. Where did the Normans originate?
2. What was the result of the Treaty of Saint-Clair-sur-Epte?
3. Who was the leader of the Norse settlers in Normandy?
4. What languages did the Normans speak?
5. When did the Norman identity begin to form?
6. Which battle is associated with the Norman conquest of England?
7. What was the significance of the Channel Islands in relation to Normandy?
8. What religions were practiced by the Normans?
9. How did the Normans influence the Duchy of Normandy under Richard I?
10. What happened to the Duchy of Normandy after Philip II's actions in 1204?

Now, I need to check if these questions are covered in the context and triples. For example, the Treaty of Saint-Clair-sur-Epte established the Duchy, so that's covered. The leader was Rollo. Languages include Old Norman, Old Norse, and Latin. Religions are Christianity and Norse paganism. The Battle of Hastings is mentioned. The Channel Islands are remnants. Under Richard I, the Duchy was organized. Philip II seized it in 1204, making it part of France.

I should ensure the answers are accurate and concise. Also, avoid repeating the same type of question. Let me verify each answer against the context and triples. For example, the languages are listed in the triples under ns1:languages. The religions are in ns3:religion. The Channel Islands are mentioned in the context as remnants.

I think that's all. Now format them into CSV with "Pergunta" and "Resposta" columns, making sure each answer is correctly derived from the provided information.
