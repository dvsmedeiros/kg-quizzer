Alright, let me try to work through this problem step by step. The user is asking for a CSV with 10 pairs of question and response related to civil disobedience based on the provided content. 

First, I need to understand what the context is. The abstract mentions that civil disobedience is about refusing to obey certain laws or orders. It also cites some historical examples like Henry David Thoreau's essay "Resistance" and mentions notable movements like those in the US, India, and Egypt.

So, for each of these points, I need to create a question and a concise response. The responses should be as short as possible but still accurate. 

I'll start with the first point about definitions: "What is civil disobedience?" The response can simply state that it's refusing to obey laws or orders.

Next, looking at the historical examples given by Thoreau, I can create a question like "Who is Henry David Thoreau known for?" and the answer would be his essay on resistance against the law.

I should make sure each question is distinct and covers different angles of the topic. Also, I need to ensure that the CSV has exactly 10 entries with each line formatted correctly, ending with a semicolon and comma as separators.

Let me list out the points again:

1. What is civil disobedience?
2. Henry David Thoreau's essay on resistance
3. Mention of the US women's suffrage movement by Martin Luther King Jr.
4. Indian independence protests by Mahatma Gandhi
5. Protests against British Raj in Iran, North Kosovo crisis, Kazakh unrest, Tony Milligan's interest

I'll structure each question to directly address these points with a brief response.

Finally, I'll compile all the questions and responses into a CSV format as per the user's instructions.
