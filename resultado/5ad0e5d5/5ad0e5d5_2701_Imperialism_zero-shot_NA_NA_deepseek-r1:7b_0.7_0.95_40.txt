Okay, so I need to help generate 10 question-answer pairs based on the given context about imperialism. Let me break this down.

First, the user provided a context that defines imperialism as the state's policy of extending power through territory or control, using either hard or soft power. It also mentions how it's distinct from colonialism and can apply to various forms of government.

I need to create 10 questions, each with a short answer related to this context. The answers should be concise, up to 10 words. I'll start by identifying key points in the context: extending power, acquiring territory, political/economic control, hard power (economic and military), soft power (cultural/diplomatic), distinct from colonialism, applies to expansion and different governments.

I can create questions around these themes. For example:
1. What does imperialism involve? Answer could be "Extending power."
2. What is one way states gain control? Answer: "Territorial acquisition."
3. What involves gaining political control? Answer: "Economic or military."
4. What's another term for hard power? Answer: "Military."
5. How else can states use power? Answer: "Cultural and diplomatic."
6. Imperialism is distinct from colonialism; what does that mean? Answer: "Colonialism focuses on people, imperialism on power."
7. Imperium can apply to which aspects? Answer: "Expansion."
8. What do governments vary in imperialism? Answer: "Types of government."
9. What's a key factor in imperialism? Answer: "Territory acquisition."
10. What's an alternative term for soft power? Answer: "Diplomatic."

I think these cover the main points and are concise enough. Now, I'll format them into a CSV as per instructions.
