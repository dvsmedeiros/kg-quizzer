Okay, the user wants me to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the provided context about the IPCC. Let me start by understanding the requirements.

First, the questions need to be relevant, varied, and have a single correct answer. The answers should be concise, up to 10 words. The language is Portuguese, and the separator is a semicolon. I need to make sure not to repeat similar questions.

Looking at the context, the IPCC is part of the UN, established by WMO and UNEP in 1988. It has 195 member states, a secretariat in Geneva, and works through working groups. The sixth assessment cycle ended in 2023, with reports released in 2021 and 2022. They shared the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize with Al Gore. The current chair is Hoesung Lee, and there's mention of past leaders like Rajendra Pachauri who resigned in 2015.

From the facts, there are triples about people associated with IPCC, like Bert Bolin as the first president, Hoesung Lee as current chair, and others. Also, the structure of the IPCC includes working groups and a task force.

I need to make sure each question is unique. Let's brainstorm possible questions:

1. What organization is the IPCC part of? (Answer: United Nations)
2. Who established the IPCC? (Answer: WMO and UNEP)
3. When was the IPCC established? (Answer: 1988)
4. Where is the secretariat located? (Answer: Geneva, Switzerland)
5. How many member states does it have? (Answer: 195)
6. Who is the current chair? (Answer: Hoesung Lee)
7. When did the sixth assessment cycle start? (Answer: 2015)
8. What was the first special report? (Answer: 1.5°C in 2018)
9. Who shared the 2007 Nobel? (Answer: Al Gore)
10. Who was the first president? (Answer: Bert Bolin)

Check if these are all covered in the context. The context mentions the establishment by WMO and UNEP, 1988, Geneva, 195 states, Hoesung Lee as current chair, sixth cycle started 2015, first special report 1.5°C in 2018, Nobel with Al Gore, and Bert Bolin as first president.

Now, ensure answers are short. For example, "United Nations" is correct. "WMO and UNEP" is okay. "1988" is concise. "Geneva, Switzerland" is the location. "195" is the number. "Hoesung Lee" is the name. "2015" for the start of the cycle. "1.5°C in 2018" might be a bit long, but maybe "1.5°C" is enough. "Al Gore" is correct. "Bert Bolin" is the answer.

Check for duplicates. Each question is different. Now format as CSV with semicolons.
