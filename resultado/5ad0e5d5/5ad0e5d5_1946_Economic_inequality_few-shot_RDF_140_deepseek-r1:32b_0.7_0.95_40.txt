Okay, I need to generate a quiz based on the given context about economic inequality. Let me start by understanding what's provided.

The context talks about different types of economic inequality like income and wealth distribution, mentions measurements such as Gini coefficient, and discusses how globalization affects inequality between and within nations. It also notes that policies can influence income distribution.

Looking at the facts, there are various resources linked to economic inequality, including books, movements, and scholars. These might provide specific examples or data points for questions.

I should create 10 varied and relevant questions. Each question must have a clear, correct answer from the context. I need to avoid repeating similar questions and ensure each one is distinct.

Let me brainstorm possible topics:
1. Types of economic inequality (income vs. wealth)
2. Measurements like Gini coefficient
3. Impact of globalization on inequality
4. Effects of economic inequality on society
5. Role of policies and taxes in reducing inequality

Now, I'll draft questions based on these areas.

For example:
- What are the two main types of economic inequality? (Income and wealth)
- How does globalization affect global vs. national inequality?
- Which coefficient is widely used to measure inequality?

I need to ensure each answer is concise, within 10 words. Also, I should vary question formats—some could ask for definitions, others for impacts or statistics.

Wait, the context mentions that income levels across countries have been converging since the 1970s. That's a good point for a question about trends over time.

Another point is how economic inequality can lead to political instability, so a question on effects would fit here.

I should also include something about policies or government actions, as they play a significant role in redistributing income.

Let me organize these ideas into structured questions with clear answers. I'll make sure each answer directly relates to the context without introducing new information.

Finally, I'll format them into CSV as required.
