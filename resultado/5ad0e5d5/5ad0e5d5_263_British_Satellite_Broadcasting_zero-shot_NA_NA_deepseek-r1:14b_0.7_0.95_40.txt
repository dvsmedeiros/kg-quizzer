Okay, so I need to create a CSV file with 10 question-response pairs based on the provided context about BSB (British Satellite Broadcasting). The user has given an example of how the output should look, and they've already provided a sample response. Let me think through how to approach this.

First, I'll read the context carefully:

- BSB was a TV company in London.
- Started broadcasting on March 25, 1990.
- Merged with Sky Television on November 2, 1990 to form British Sky Broadcasting.

I need to generate questions that cover these points. Each question should be relevant and each answer should be concise—up to 10 words.

Let me list the key facts:

1. BSB stands for British Satellite Broadcasting.
2. It was a television company based in London.
3. Started broadcasting on March 25, 1990.
4. They provided direct broadcast satellite TV services in the UK.
5. Merged with Sky Television on November 2, 1990.
6. The merger formed British Sky Broadcasting.

Now, I'll think of possible questions:

- What does BSB stand for? (Answer: British Satellite Broadcasting)
- Where was BSB headquartered? (London)
- When did BSB start broadcasting? (March 25, 1990)
- What type of services did BSB provide? (Direct broadcast satellite television)
- Which company did BSB merge with? (Sky Television plc)
- What was the result of the merger? (British Sky Broadcasting)

I need 10 questions. Maybe I can expand on each point or rephrase them.

For example:

6. With whom did BSB merge in November 1990? (Sky Television plc)
7. When was the merger with Sky Television? (November 2, 1990)
8. What country did BSB serve via satellite TV? (United Kingdom)
9. What field did BSB operate in? (Television)
10. Name the company formed after the merger. (British Sky Broadcasting)

Wait, but I should ensure that each question is unique and covers different aspects without repeating information unnecessarily.

Let me structure them:

1. Quem fundou a BSB?
   - Answer: British Satellite Broadcasting
   (But maybe better to ask "O que BSB significa?" for clarity.)

2. Onde a BSB estava sediada? Resposta: Londres

3. Quando a BSB começou a transmitir? 25 de março de 1990

4. Qual tipo de serviço a BSB oferecia? Televisão por satélite direta

5. Com qual empresa a BSB se uniu? Sky Television plc

6. Em que data ocorreu a fusão? 2 de novembro de 1990

7. Qual foi o resultado da fusão? British Sky Broadcasting

8. Em qual país a BSB operava? Reino Unido

9. Qual era o objetivo principal da BSB? Fornecer TV via satélite diretamente

10. Qual foi a data de início das transmissões da BSB? 25 de março de 1990

Wait, question 3 and 6 could be combined or phrased differently to avoid repetition in answers if possible. Alternatively, perhaps the user allows some overlap since each question is unique.

I think that's a good set of questions covering all key points from the context.
