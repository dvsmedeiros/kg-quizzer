Okay, so I need to generate a CSV based on the given RDF data about Victoria (Australia). Let me first understand what's provided.

Looking at the data, it's an RDF description of Victoria with some specific properties:
- febRecordHighC: 48.8
- marRecordHighC: 44.4
- It uses a template called Template:Expand_section
- There's a depiction link to an image on Wikimedia.

The user has provided an example CSV structure, which includes columns like URI, P (property), O (object). They've also given some additional fields like country, state/province, city, etc., but in the RDF data, I don't see all those fields filled out. Most entries relate to locations associated with Victoria.

Wait, actually, looking closer, the main entry is about Victoria itself. But then there are many other URIs pointing to various places and entities within Victoria, each linking back to Victoria as their subdivision or location.

So, for the CSV, I should probably include all these related URIs, extracting properties like febRecordHighC and marRecordHighC where applicable. However, most of the entries in the RDF data are about different locations (like cities, colleges, power stations) that have a location property pointing to Victoria.

In the example CSV provided by the user, they included columns for URI, P, O, and others like country, state/province, city, etc., but it's not clear if all those fields should be filled. Since the RDF data doesn't provide information about country or city for each entry, maybe only certain columns will have data.

I need to parse each triple in the RDF data and extract the subject (URI), predicate (P), and object (O). Then, map these into the CSV accordingly. For example:

- The main entry is <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Victoria_(Australia)>, with properties febRecordHighC and marRecordHighC.
- All other URIs like <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Albury,_Victoria> have a location predicate pointing to Victoria.

So, the CSV should list each URI as a row, with their respective P and O. For the main Victoria entry, the P would be febRecordHighC and marRecordHighC, and for others, it's usually location or birthPlace/deathPlace.

I need to make sure that all triples are included, even if some columns might have missing data. The user provided an example with more columns, but perhaps only URI, P, O are necessary unless specified otherwise.

Wait, the user mentioned "conforme Instruções e Regras" (according to instructions and rules) but didn't provide detailed ones here. So I'll stick with extracting all triples into a CSV with URI, P, O as columns.
