Com base nas instruções fornecidas, vou criar um arquivo CSV que contém os dados de estabelecimentos de ensino privados listados no trecho do código HTML fornecido anteriormente.

### Análise dos Dados:
1. **URL**: A URL é a primeira parte da linha e está na forma `http://dbpedia.org/resource/...`
2. **Tipo Escola (Schooltype)**: Este é o tipo de estabelecimento escolar, que neste caso sempre é "Private_school".
3. **Nome do Estabelecimento**: O nome do estabelecimento é extraído diretamente da URL após `http://dbpedia.org/resource/`.

### Formato do CSV:
- As linhas no CSV devem seguir o formato: `"url","schooltype","name"`

Agora, vamos gerar as linhas para cada estabelecimento de ensino privado listado.
