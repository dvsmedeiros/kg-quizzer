Okay, I need to help this user generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the given context. The context is about private schools, so I should focus on that topic. 

First, I'll read the provided context carefully. It says a private school is not administered or funded by the government and is independently operated. They often have a board of governors. So key points are independence from government funding, self-governance, and being privately owned.

Now, I need to create 10 relevant questions. Let me think about different aspects: definition, governance, comparison with public schools, sources of funding, independence, types, requirements for operation, examples, impact on education, and history.

For each question, the answer should be concise, up to 10 words. Let me draft them one by one.

1. What is a private school? Answer: A school not funded by government.
2. How are they different from public schools? They have independent governance.
3. Where do their funds usually come from? From private sources.
4. Are they dependent on government? No, they're independent.
5. What ensures their operation? Independent governance.
6. Do they require a board of governors? Yes, typically.
7. What is not true about private schools? Government funding.
8. Which term describes self-governance? Autonomous operation.
9. Can they be publicly funded? Not usually; they're independent.
10. What's a common feature of private schools? Self-governance.

Now, translating these into Portuguese and formatting as CSV with semicolon separators. I'll make sure each pair is on a new line without any extra spaces or punctuation errors.

Let me double-check that each answer accurately reflects the context and is within the word limit. Everything seems good.
