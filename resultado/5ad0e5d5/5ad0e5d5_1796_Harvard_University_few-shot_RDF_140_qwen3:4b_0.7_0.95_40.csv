Okay; I need to generate a CSV file based on the provided data. Let me start by understanding the data and the instructions.
Now; the task is to extract all these entries and format them into a CSV. Let me go through the data step by step.
I need to make sure that all entries are included. The user might have a lot of entries; so I need to process each line.
Let me check if there are any inconsistencies. For example; some entries might have different namespaces. The user might want to include both ns1 and ns2 properties in the CSV.
I need to make sure that the name is correctly extracted from the subject URI. For example; "http://dbpedia.org/resource/William_Smith_Shaw" becomes "William Smith Shaw".
Once all entries are processed; the CSV should be generated. Let me proceed to create the CSV with all these entries.
