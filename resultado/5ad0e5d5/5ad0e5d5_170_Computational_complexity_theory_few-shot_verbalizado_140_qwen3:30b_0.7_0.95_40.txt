Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the given context about computational complexity theory. First, I need to make sure I understand the requirements.

The context provided is a detailed abstract about computational complexity theory, including its focus on classifying problems by resource usage, related fields like algorithm analysis and computability theory, and mentions of key concepts like time, storage, communication, and circuit complexity. There are also some triples with information about people and categories related to the theory.

The user's example shows that the questions should be varied and cover different aspects of the topic. Each answer needs to be concise, up to 10 words, and in Portuguese. The CSV format must use semicolons as separators.

First, I'll go through the abstract and identify key points. The main topics are classification of problems by resource usage, models of computation, measures like time and storage, related fields (analysis of algorithms, computability theory), the P vs NP problem, and other complexity measures like communication, circuit, and parallel computing.

Next, I'll think of possible questions. For example, asking about the main focus of the theory, the resources measured, related fields, key problems, etc. I need to ensure that each question is unique and covers different aspects. Also, the answers must be directly inferable from the context.

Let me check the example given. The first question is about the branch of computer science theory that classifies problems by difficulty. The answer is "teoria da complexidade computacional". So I need to make sure that the answers are precise and match the terminology used in the context.

I should avoid repeating similar questions. For instance, instead of asking about resources multiple times, I can ask about different types like time, storage, communication, circuits, etc. Also, mention key figures or problems like P vs NP, or the role of complexity theory in practical limits.

Another thing is to use the facts provided. For example, the context mentions that computational complexity theory is related to analysis of algorithms and computability theory. So a question about related fields would have those as answers.

I need to make sure that each answer is short. For example, "tempo e armazenamento" for the two main resources. Also, check that the answers are in Portuguese and match the required length.

Let me draft some questions:

1. What is the main focus of computational complexity theory? (Answer: classificar problemas computacionais por uso de recursos)
2. What are the two main resources measured? (tempo e armazenamento)
3. What is the role of complexity theory in practical limits? (determinar os limites práticos)
4. What is the P vs NP problem related to? (teoria da complexidade computacional)
5. What is the difference between analysis of algorithms and complexity theory? (analisar recursos de um algoritmo vs classificar problemas)
6. What are other measures of complexity? (comunicação, portas em circuitos)
7. What is the purpose of mathematical models in complexity theory? (estudar problemas e quantificar recursos)
8. What is the main goal of computational complexity theory? (classificar problemas com restrições de recursos)
9. What are the two closely related fields? (análise de algoritmos e teoria da computabilidade)
10. What is the main question complexity theory tries to answer? (classificar problemas que podem ou não ser resolvidos)

Wait, some of these might be too similar. Need to vary them. Also, check that answers are within 10 words. For example, "classificar problemas computacionais por uso de recursos" is 6 words, which is okay.

I need to ensure that each answer is directly from the context. For instance, the abstract mentions "relating these classes to each other" so a question about that could be "Como os problemas são relacionados na teoria da complexidade?" with answer "relacionando-as entre si".

Another point: the abstract mentions "the amount of resources needed to solve them, such as time and storage." So a question about the resources measured would have "tempo e armazenamento" as the answer.

Also, the context includes that the theory uses models like Turing machines, but the abstract doesn't mention that. Wait, the facts mention "Turing machine 2b.svg" as an image, but the abstract doesn't. So maybe avoid that unless it's in the abstract. The abstract does mention "mathematical models of computation", so a question could be about the models used, answer "modelos matemáticos de computação".

I think I have enough points. Now, structure them into 10 pairs, ensuring they are varied and answers are correct.
