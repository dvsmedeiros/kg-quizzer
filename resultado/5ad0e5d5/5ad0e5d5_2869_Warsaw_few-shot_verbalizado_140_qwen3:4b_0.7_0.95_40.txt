Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the provided context about Warsaw. Let me start by carefully reading through the context to understand all the key points.

First, the context mentions that Warsaw is the capital and largest city of Poland, located on the Vistula River. It has a population of about 1.86 million, with a metropolitan area of 3.1 million. It's an Alpha global city, a major cultural, political, and economic hub, and the seat of government. There's info about its history, including being bombed during WWII, the Ghetto Uprising, and the Warsaw Uprising. It has two international airports, Warsaw Chopin and Modlin. Public transport includes the metro, buses, trams, and commuter rail. The city is a center for research, business process outsourcing, and IT outsourcing. The Warsaw Stock Exchange is the largest in Central and Eastern Europe. Frontex, the EU agency for border security, and ODIHR, an OSCE institution, have their headquarters there. There are notable architectural sites like the Old Town, Royal Castle, Sigismund's Column, Wilanów Palace, etc. Also, it has universities, museums, theaters, zoos, and sports teams like Legia Warsaw. The climate includes temperature data, and some historical and cultural facts about people born or died in Warsaw.

Now, I need to create 10 varied questions that are relevant to this information. The answers should be short, concise, and directly inferable from the context. I should avoid repetition and ensure each question is unique. Let's start brainstorming.

1. What is the largest city in Poland? Answer: Warsaw.
2. Which river is Warsaw located on? Answer: Vistula.
3. What is the population of Warsaw? Answer: 1.86 million.
4. What is the name of the largest airport in Warsaw? Answer: Warsaw Chopin.
5. What is the main economic activity in Warsaw? Answer: Research and development.
6. Which EU agency is based in Warsaw? Answer: Frontex.
7. What is the name of the main stadium in Warsaw? Answer: Stadion Narodowy.

9. What is the temperature record for Warsaw in March? Answer: 22.9°C.
10. What is the name of the main university in Warsaw? Answer: University of Warsaw.

Wait, but the user provided a sample with some specific details. Let me check if I can include more specific facts from the facts list. For example, the temperature in February is -3.3°C, or the record for December is 15.4°C. Also, there's info about the Old Town being a World Heritage Site. The Warsaw Zoo is one of the largest in the country. The Warsaw Stock Exchange is the largest in CE Europe. The reconstructed Old Town has examples of nearly every European architectural style. The Royal Castle is a notable site. The Royal Route has numerous churches and mansions. The Warsaw Zoo is one of the largest and most-visited.

I need to make sure each question is unique and covers different aspects. Let me try to include more specific points. For example, the number of districts in Warsaw is 18. The area of the city is 517 km². The metropolitan area is 6,100 km². The city has 200 sq mi of area. The city has an extensive tram network. The Warsaw Metro is a major public transport. The city is known for its arts and club scenes. The Warsaw Marathon is an event. The city has a significant number of skyscrapers. The tallest building is Varso Place. The Warsaw Zoo is among the largest. The city has parks covering a quarter of its area. The city has a football club called Legia Warsaw. The city has a national football stadium. The city has a number of universities, including the University of Warsaw, Warsaw University of Technology, etc. The city has a number of museums, like the National Museum, Zachęta Art Gallery, etc. The city has a number of theaters, like the Warsaw Grand Theatre. The city has a number of historical sites, like the Royal Castle, Sigismund's Column, etc.

Let me try to list 10 unique questions. Let's start with the basics first, then move to more specific details.

1. What is the capital of Poland? Answer: Warsaw.
2. Which river is Warsaw located on? Answer: Vistula.
3. What is the population of Warsaw? Answer: 1.86 million.
4. What is the name of the largest airport in Warsaw? Answer: Warsaw Chopin.
5. What is the main economic activity in Warsaw? Answer: Research and development.
6. Which EU agency is based in Warsaw? Answer: Frontex.
7. What is the name of the main stadium in Warsaw? Answer: Stadion Narodowy.
8. What is the name of the largest theater in Warsaw? Answer: Warsaw Grand Theatre.
9. What is the temperature record for Warsaw in March? Answer: 22.9°C.
10. What is the name of the main university in Warsaw? Answer: University of Warsaw.

Wait, but the sample answer given by the user in the example had some more specific details. For example, the answer to the question about the city's area is 517 km². Also, the city has 200 sq mi of area. The metropolitan area is 3.1 million. The city has 18 districts. The city has 200 sq mi. The city has 517 km². The city has 6,100 km² metropolitan area. The city has 200 sq mi of area. The city has 517 km². The city has 6,100 km². Also, the city has 200 sq mi. The city has 517 km². The city has 6,100 km². Wait, that's confusing. Let me check the exact numbers from the context.

The context says: "Warsaw has an area of 517 km² (200 sq mi) and a metropolitan area of 6,100 km² (2,350 sq mi)." So the city's area is 517 km², and the metropolitan area is 6,100 km². The city has 18 districts. The city has 200 sq mi (which is the same as 517 km²). So maybe a question could be about the area of the city.

Another point is the Warsaw Stock Exchange being the largest in CE Europe. The city is a cultural and historical center. The reconstructed Old Town is a UNESCO site. The city has a number of universities and museums.

So maybe the questions could be:

1. What is the capital of Poland? Answer: Warsaw.
2. Which river is Warsaw located on? Answer: Vistula.
3. What is the area of Warsaw? Answer: 517 km².
4. What is the name of the largest airport in Warsaw? Answer: Warsaw Chopin.
5. What is the main economic activity in Warsaw? Answer: Research and development.
6. Which EU agency is based in Warsaw? Answer: Frontex.
7. What is the name of the main stadium in Warsaw? Answer: Stadion Narodowy.
8. What is the name of the largest theater in Warsaw? Answer: Warsaw Grand Theatre.
9. What is the temperature record for Warsaw in March? Answer: 22.9°C.
10. What is the name of the main university in Warsaw? Answer: University of Warsaw.

I think these are all valid and based on the context. Let me check if any of these are not covered in the facts. For example, the answer about the main economic activity is "research and development", which is mentioned in the context. The Frontex is mentioned as an EU agency in the context. The main stadium is Stadion Narodowy. The largest theater is Warsaw Grand Theatre. The temperature in March is 22.9°C. The main university is University of Warsaw. The area is 517 km². The capital is Warsaw. The river is Vistula.

Yes, these all seem to be covered. Now, I need to make sure each answer is correct and directly from the context. I think these are all correct. So the final CSV will have these 10 pairs.
