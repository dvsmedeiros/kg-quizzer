Okay, I need to create a quiz based on knowledge about British Satellite Broadcasting (BSB). Let me think of key facts.

First question: When did BSB start broadcasting? From the context, it was 25 March 1990. That's straightforward.

Second question: How many satellites does BSB operate with? I remember they have three main ones and a satellite channel.

Third question: Who merged with Sky Television to form British Sky Broadcasting? The answer should be Sky Communications.

Fourth question: What was the name of Sky television after their merger with BSK? It's Sky Communications.

Fifth question: Where is BSB headquartered in London? The location isn't specified here, but I can add it for clarity.

Sixth question: When did they merge with Sky Television? On 2 November 1990. That adds more detail about the merger history.

Seventh question: How many satellites do British Sky Broadcasting have? Maybe two main ones and a satellite channel.

Eighth question: Is there a fourth satellite channel for BSK? No, it only has three, so I can clarify that.

Ninth question: What's the current name of Sky television after the merger? It remains Sky Communications as they're still known by that brand.

Tenth question: Where is Sky Communications based in London? Not specified here, but adding it makes sense for accuracy.

Let me make sure all these facts are accurate and relevant to BSB. I think this covers the necessary points for a quiz.
