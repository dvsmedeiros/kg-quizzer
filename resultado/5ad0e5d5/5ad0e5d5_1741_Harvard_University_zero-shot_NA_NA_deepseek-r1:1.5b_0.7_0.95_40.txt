Okay, I need to create a Python script that generates 10 pairs of questions with their corresponding answers based on the provided context about Harvard University. First, I'll review the context thoroughly to identify key points and structure the questions around them.

The context is quite dense, covering the history, campus locations, endowments, libraries, academic programs, alumni achievements, and notable awards. I should pick 10 main concepts or themes from this text that can form the basis of each question and answer pair.

Let me list out some key points:

1. Harvard University's location: Cambridge, Massachusetts.
2. Its constituent campuses: Cambridge campus, Allston neighborhood in Boston, Longwood Medical Area.
3. Endowment value: $50.9 billion.
4. Endowment per-student ranking: fifth-largest in the U.S.
5. Harvard Library as the largest academic library system with 79 individual libraries.
6. The founding status and historical context of Harvard College.
7. Its transformation into a modern research university after the Civil War.
8. Notable alumni, Nobel laureates, Fields Medalists, U.S. presidents, MacArthur Fellows, Rhodes Scholars, Marshall Scholars, Fulbright Scholars, Academy Awards, Pulitzer Prizes, and Olympic medals.

Using these points, I can form 10 questions targeting different aspects of Harvard University. Each question will be concise, focusing on a specific piece of information or theme from the context.

I'll structure each question to ask for a short answer, keeping it clear and within the limit of "at√© 10 palavras." After drafting all ten questions, I'll compile them into a CSV format as specified.
