Okay, the user wants me to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the provided context about Southern California. Let me start by understanding the context thoroughly. The key points are: Southern California is a region in California, includes Los Angeles, has 10 counties, borders Arizona and Nevada, and the Colorado Desert and River are on the eastern border. Also, it shares a southern border with Baja California.

First, I need to create questions that test knowledge of these details. Let me brainstorm possible questions. For example, what is the common abbreviation for Southern California? The answer would be SoCal. Next, which city is the second most populous urban area in the US? Los Angeles. Then, how many counties are in the region? Ten. 

Wait, the context mentions ten counties, so that's a good question. Also, the Colorado River is part of the eastern border with Arizona. So a question about the river's location. Another point is the southern border with Baja California. Maybe a question about the border with Mexico. 

I need to ensure each question is distinct and covers different aspects. Let me list out possible questions and their answers. Let me check if the answers are concise, under 10 words. Also, avoid repetition. For example, one question about the counties, another about the river, another about the border with Arizona, another about the border with Nevada, another about the southern border, etc. 

Wait, the context says San Bernardino County shares a border with Nevada to the northeast. So a question about that. Also, the Colorado Desert is on the eastern border with Arizona. So another question about the desert. 

Let me count the questions. Ten questions. Let me make sure each answer is accurate based on the context. For example, the answer to "Which county shares a border with Nevada?" is San Bernardino. 

I need to structure each line as pergunta;resposta. Also, ensure the CSV format is correct, with semicolons as separators. Let me double-check each pair for correctness and conciseness. Alright, that should cover all the key points without overlapping information. Now, format them into the CSV as specified.
