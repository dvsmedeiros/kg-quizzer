Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the provided context about the Normans. First, I need to understand the context thoroughly. The context mentions the origin of the Normans from Norse Vikings and indigenous West Franks, their adoption of French culture, key historical events like the Battle of Hastings, their influence in various regions, and their languages and religions.

I should start by identifying key facts and unique aspects from the context. For example, the origin of the Normans, their languages, the role of Rollo, the Battle of Hastings, their religious shift from Norse paganism to Christianity, and their cultural impact. I need to ensure each question is distinct and covers different aspects to avoid repetition.

Looking at the example provided, the questions are varied, covering origin, language, historical events, religion, and cultural impact. I should follow that structure. Let me list possible questions:

1. Origin of the Normans (Viking and Frankish intermingling)
2. Languages spoken by Normans (Old Norman, Latin, Old Norse)
3. When did the Norman identity form? (Early 10th century)
4. Who was Rollo? (Scandinavian Viking leader who swore fealty to France)
5. Religious shift (from Norse paganism to Christianity)
6. Key historical event (Battle of Hastings in 1066)
7. Influence on other regions (e.g., Sicily, England)
8. Current remnants of the Duchy (Channel Islands)
9. Architectural style (Norman architecture)
10. Notable figures (e.g., William the Conqueror)

Now, I need to check if these questions are covered in the context and ensure answers are concise. Also, verify that each answer is directly inferable from the text. For example, the answer to the origin question should mention the intermingling of Norse Vikings and West Franks. The languages include Old Norman, Latin, and Old Norse. The Battle of Hastings is mentioned as the conquest of England in 1066. The Channel Islands are the last remnants. Norman architecture is referenced in the example with St Bride's Church. 

I should also ensure that answers are within 10 words. For instance, "Rollo, a Scandinavian Viking leader" is concise. The religious shift answer would be "Norse paganism to Christianity." For the current remnants, "Channel Islands" is sufficient. 

Avoiding repetition is crucial. The example already has questions about the Battle of Hastings and the Duchy's remnants, so I need to ensure other questions don't overlap. Checking the facts provided, there are mentions of specific battles, castles, and languages. 

Finally, format each line as "pergunta;resposta" with semicolons. Make sure there are exactly 10 lines and no markdown. Let me compile the list now, cross-referencing the context to confirm accuracy and conciseness.
