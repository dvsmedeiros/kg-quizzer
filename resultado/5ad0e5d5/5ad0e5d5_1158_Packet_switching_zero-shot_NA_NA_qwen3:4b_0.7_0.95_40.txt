Okay, the user wants me to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the provided context about packet switching. Let me start by understanding the context thoroughly.

The context talks about packet switching in telecommunications, its components (header and payload), its development by Paul Baran in the 1960s, and Donald Davies' contribution. It also mentions the ARPANET and the shift from pre-allocated bandwidth to packet switching.

First, I need to create questions that test knowledge of these key points. The answers must be concise, under 10 words each. Let me brainstorm possible questions.

1. What is packet switching based on? The answer is "Data packets transmitted over digital networks."
2. What are packets made of? "Header and payload."
3. What does the header contain? "Destination information."
4. Who developed the concept in the 1960s? "Paul Baran."
5. What was the goal of Baran's work? "Fault-tolerant, efficient routing."
6. What did Baran's ideas contradict? "Pre-allocated network bandwidth."
7. When did Davies coin the term packet switching? "1965."
8. What networks were influenced by Davies' work? "ARPANET and others."
9. What is the primary basis for data communications? "Packet switching."
10. What is the purpose of the payload? "Data content."

Now, I need to ensure each question is relevant and the answers are accurate. Let me check the context again to confirm. Yes, these points are all covered. The next step is to format them into CSV as specified. Each line should be "question;answer". No extra text, just the CSV. Let me make sure there are 10 entries and that each answer is under 10 words. Looks good. I'll list them out in order.
