Okay, so I need to create a CSV file with 10 question-answer pairs based on the provided context about the 1973 oil crisis. The questions should be relevant to the context, and each answer should be a short correct response in Portuguese, separated by semicolons.

First, I'll read through the context carefully to extract key points:

- **When did it start?** October 1973
- **Who was involved?** OAPEC led by Saudi Arabia
- **Why?** Oil embargo against countries supporting Israel during Yom Kippur War
- **Targeted countries:** Canada, Japan, Netherlands, UK, US; later extended to Portugal, Rhodesia, South Africa
- **Duration:** From October 1973 to March 1974
- **Oil price increase:** Nearly 300% globally, up to $12 per barrel; US prices were higher
- **Effects:** Global politics and economy impacted, leading to short- and long-term effects
- **Also known as:** First oil shock, followed by the 1979 crisis (second oil shock)

Now, I'll brainstorm possible questions based on these points. Each question should target a specific piece of information.

Possible questions:

1. When did the 1973 oil crisis begin?
2. Which organization led the oil embargo?
3. Why was the oil embargo imposed?
4. What countries were initially targeted by the embargo?
5. How long did the oil embargo last?
6. What was the main reason for the oil price increase?
7. By how much did global oil prices rise during the crisis?
8. Which country's support led to the embargo?
9. What was another name for the 1973 oil crisis?
10. What was a direct consequence of the oil embargo?

Now, I'll translate these into Portuguese and structure them as questions with short answers.

I should ensure that each question is clear and directly related to the context. The answers should be concise, up to 10 words each.
