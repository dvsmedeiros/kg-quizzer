Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the provided context about European Union law. Let me start by reading the context carefully.

The context says that EU law is a system of supranational laws within 27 member states, established since 1952 with the European Coal and Steel Community. Its goals include peace, social justice, a social market economy with full employment, and environmental protection. The Treaties form the constitutional structure, and the Court of Justice of the European Union handles interpretation and case law.

Now, looking at the facts provided, there are some triples mentioning academic disciplines related to EU law, like Common Market Law Review, Henry G. Schermers, and John Bell. However, the main context is the abstract about EU law itself. I should focus on the abstract for most questions, using the facts only if necessary.

I need to ensure that each question is unique and covers different aspects of the context. Let me brainstorm possible questions:

1. What is the primary purpose of European Union law? Answer could be promoting peace, social justice, etc.
2. How many member states are part of the EU? The answer is 27.
3. When was the European Coal and Steel Community founded? 1952.
4. What is the constitutional structure of EU law? The Treaties agreed by member states.
5. Which judicial body interprets EU law? The Court of Justice of the European Union.
6. What are the key areas EU law aims to protect? Environmental protection, social justice, etc.
7. What economic model does the EU promote? Social market economy with full employment.
8. What is the role of the Court of Justice of the European Union? Creating and interpreting EU case law.
9. What is the significance of the Treaties of the European Union? Forming the constitutional structure.
10. What is the main goal of the European Coal and Steel Community? Promoting peace and economic cooperation.

Wait, some of these might be too similar. Let me check for uniqueness. Also, the answers need to be concise, under 10 words. Let me rephrase some:

1. What is the main objective of EU law? Promoting peace, social justice, and environmental protection.
2. How many member states are in the EU? 27.
3. When was the European Coal and Steel Community established? 1952.
4. What forms the constitutional structure of EU law? The Treaties of the European Union.
5. Which institution interprets EU law? The Court of Justice of the European Union.
6. What economic model does the EU support? A social market economy with full employment.
7. What is the role of the Court of Justice of the European Union? Interpreting EU law and creating case law.
8. What are the key areas of focus for EU law? Peace, social justice, environmental protection, and employment.
9. What was the original name of the EU's founding organization? European Coal and Steel Community.
10. How has EU law evolved over time? It has expanded since 1952 to include more areas and member states.

I need to make sure each answer is directly from the context. For example, the answer to question 10 might be inferred as "grown over time since 1952" from the context. Also, checking if all answers are under 10 words. Let me count:

1. 10 words.
2. 3 words.
3. 4 words.
4. 7 words.
5. 7 words.
6. 7 words.
7. 10 words.
8. 10 words.
9. 8 words.
10. 7 words.

All good. Now, check for repetition. Each question is about a different aspect. Now, format them as CSV with semicolons. Ensure the example format is followed. Let me list them out properly.
