Okay; I need to generate a CSV file based on the provided turtle data about Southern California. Let me start by understanding the data structure. 
Looking at the data for Southern California; the properties are:
I need to list these classes in the "Type (class)" column; possibly separated by commas. 
Subdivision: the data includes multiple subdivisions under ns1:subdivision and ns2:subdivisionName. The user's instruction says to include "Subdivision" which are the actual subdivisions listed. In the data; ns1:subdivision and ns2:subdivisionName both list the same counties. So I need to list those counties.
Now; the name is "Southern California" from ns2:name.
Population: since there's no property for populationTotal; I'll leave that out as per the data provided.
Now; let's map each of these columns with the data from the turtle file.
Country: "United States" (from ns1:country which is a URI to United_States; so the name is "United States").
- Imperial County; California
- Los Angeles County; California
- Riverside County; California
Subdivision Type: "List of counties in California"; "List of sovereign states" (from ns2:subdivisionType).
Total Population: empty; since no data.

- <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Los_Angeles_County;_California>
- <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Riverside_County;_California>
- Imperial County; California
- Los Angeles County; California
- Riverside County; California
Similarly; the Subdivision Name is the same as Subdivision.
Based on the provided Turtle data and the specified instructions; here is the generated CSV file:
2. **Type (class)**: All classes listed in the Turtle data; separated by commas.
5. **Total Area in Square Miles**: Value from `ns2:areaTotalSqMi` (56;505).
10. **Total Population**: No population data was provided in the input; so this field is left empty.
