Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the provided context and facts. Let me start by understanding the context. The context explains civil disobedience as active refusal to obey unjust laws, nonviolent, and mentions historical figures like Henry David Thoreau, Susan B. Anthony, Saad Zaghloul, Mahatma Gandhi, and Martin Luther King Jr. The facts include various events and movements that used civil disobedience, like the 1998 Russian miners' strike, 2015 Montenegrin crisis, and others.

First, I should ensure the questions are varied and cover different aspects: definitions, key figures, historical events, and examples. Each answer must be concise, up to 10 words. I need to avoid repeating similar questions. Let me list possible questions:

1. What is civil disobedience? (Answer: Active refusal to obey unjust laws.)
2. Who popularized the term in the US? (Answer: Henry David Thoreau.)
3. Which movement used civil disobedience for independence? (Answer: Indian independence movement.)
4. What is a key principle of civil disobedience? (Answer: Nonviolent resistance.)
5. Which leader used it in the civil rights movement? (Answer: Martin Luther King Jr.)
6. What event is linked to the 1998 Russian miners' strike? (Answer: Civil disobedience.)
7. Which country's protests involved civil disobedience in 2017? (Answer: Montenegro.)
8. What is an example of civil disobedience in the 1960s? (Answer: Civil rights movement.)
9. Which group used civil disobedience against British occupation? (Answer: Egyptian Revolution of 1919.)
10. What term describes peaceful protests? (Answer: Nonviolent resistance.)

Wait, some answers might be too long. Let me check word counts. Also, ensure answers are directly from the context or facts. For example, the 1998 Russian miners' strike is mentioned in the facts. The answer should be "Civil disobedience" as per the fact. Similarly, the 2017 Montenegrin protests are linked to civil disobedience. I need to make sure each answer is concise and accurate. Also, avoid repetition. Let me structure each line with the correct separator and format.
