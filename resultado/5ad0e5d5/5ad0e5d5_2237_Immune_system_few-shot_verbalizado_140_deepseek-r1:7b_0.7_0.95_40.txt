Okay, I need to generate a CSV with 10 question-answer pairs based on the given context about the immune system. Let me start by carefully reading and understanding the provided information.

First, the context describes various aspects of the immune system, including its subsystems (innate and adaptive immunity), components like T cells, B cells, dendritic cells, macrophages, and natural killer cells, as well as functions such as detecting pathogens, immune responses, and related medical conditions. It also mentions specific terms, examples, and some associated external resources.

Now, I'll go through the 'Fatos' section to list all relevant information points that could be used for questions:

1. The immune system is involved in cell death and the immune response.
2. The immune system has a description page: Template:Immune system.
3. Lajos Kemény is associated with the immune system.
4. T cells are part of the immune system.
5. The immune system uses Template:Short description.
6. Bone marrow is part of the immune system.
7. Langerhans cells belong to the immune system.
8. The immune system has correspondences like antimicrobial responses and antigen recognition.
9. Granulocytes and monocytes are part of the immune system.
10. Immune system templates include Template:Refend, Template:Rp, etc.
11. Natural killer cells are in the immune system.
12. The immune system is categorized under Category:Immune system.
13. Sepsis is caused by the immune system.
14. The immune system has images like Primary immune response 1.png and Rheumatoid Arthritis.jpg.
15. Charles Surh works in the immune system field.
16. Neutrophils, macrophages, mast cells, dendritic cells are part of the immune system.
17. Food allergies relate to the immune system.
18. The immune system uses templates like Template:Wikiquote and has further pages.
19. Rheumatology is a specialty under the immune system.
20. César Milstein is associated with the immune system.
21. The immune system includes images such as Macs killing cancer cell.jpg.
22. It uses templates like Template:Featured article, Template:Sfn, etc.
23. Histiocytes and eosinophils are part of the immune system.
24. The immune system has images including Paul Ehrlich's photo from 1915.
25. White blood cells (like lymphocytes) are in the immune system.
26. External resources like books and categories related to immunology are mentioned.

Next, I'll create 10 varied questions based on these points:

1. What subsystem of the immune system provides a preconfigured response?
   - Answer: Innate immune system

2. Which cells detect pathogens in the innate immune system?
   - Answer: Neutrophils and macrophages

3. What process allows T cells to recognize past pathogens for adaptive immunity?
   - Answer: MHC presentation

4. Which structures are part of the immune system's defense mechanism against foreign substances?
   - Answer: Phagocytosis, phagosomes, phagophores

5. Who wrote "The science of conjecture" related to immune mechanisms?
   - Answer: César Milstein

6. Which immune cells kill cancerous cells and enhance the adaptive response?
   - Answer: Natural killer (NK) cells

7. What is a common cause of autoimmune diseases linked to hyperactive immune responses?
   - Answer: Autoimmune reactions, such as Hashimoto's thyroiditis or lupus erythematosus

8. Which external resource describes immune system templates on Wikipedia?
   - Answer: Template:Immune system

9. What medical condition is caused by an overactive immune system attacking its own tissues?
   - Answer: Autoimmunity-related diseases like rheumatoid arthritis

10. What disease in humans is linked to immunodeficiency due to HIV/AIDS?
    - Answer: Acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS)

I'll ensure each answer is concise, up to 10 words, and directly relates to the context provided. Finally, I'll format them into a CSV with the separator ';' between each question and answer pair.
