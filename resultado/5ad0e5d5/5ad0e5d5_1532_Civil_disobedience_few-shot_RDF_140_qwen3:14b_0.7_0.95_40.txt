Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format about civil disobedience, using the provided context and facts. First, I need to make sure I understand the context and the facts provided.

The context explains that civil disobedience is the refusal to obey certain laws, demands, or commands of a government, usually nonviolent. It's linked to figures like Henry David Thoreau, Susan B. Anthony, Gandhi, and Martin Luther King Jr. The examples include the civil rights movement and various historical events.

Looking at the facts, there's a list of events and people associated with civil disobedience. For example, the 2015–2016 Montenegrin crisis, 2017 Albanian protests, and several others. Also, Henry David Thoreau is noted for his essay "Civil Disobedience," and Gandhi used it in India's independence movement.

Now, I need to create varied questions that cover different aspects: definitions, key figures, historical examples, and the nature of civil disobedience. Each question should have a concise answer based on the context or facts.

I should avoid repeating similar questions. Let me start by listing possible topics. For example, definition, nonviolence aspect, Thoreau's contribution, Gandhi's movement, civil rights movement, examples from the facts, reasons for using civil disobedience, and maybe some specific events mentioned in the facts.

Wait, the user's example includes some events like the Russian miners' strike, but I need to check if those are in the provided facts. The facts list several protests and events with civil disobedience methods. So I can use those as examples.

Let me draft some questions:

1. What is the definition of civil disobedience according to the context?
   Answer: Active refusal to obey laws, nonviolent.

2. Who popularized the term "civil disobedience" in the US?
   Answer: Henry David Thoreau.

3. Which movement in India used civil disobedience for independence?
   Answer: Mahatma Gandhi's protests.

4. What is a key characteristic of civil disobedience?
   Answer: Nonviolent resistance.

5. Which historical event in the US civil rights movement involved civil disobedience?
   Answer: Martin Luther King Jr.'s protests.

6. What was the purpose of the Code Rood?
   Answer: Civil disobedience (from the facts).

7. Which protest in 2015-2016 Montenegro used civil disobedience?
   Answer: Montenegrin crisis.

8. Why did Martin Luther King Jr. support civil disobedience?
   Answer: To express reverence for law by breaking unjust laws.

9. What is an example of a protest in 2017 involving civil disobedience?
   Answer: Serbian protests.

10. Who was a leader in the US women's suffrage movement using civil disobedience?
    Answer: Susan B. Anthony.

I need to check if these answers are accurate based on the context and facts. Also, ensure that each answer is under 10 words. Let me verify each one.

Yes, the answers align with the context. For example, the definition is covered, Thoreau's role is mentioned, Gandhi's movement, the civil rights movement, the Montenegrin crisis, and the examples from the facts. The answer about Code Rood's purpose is directly from the facts.

Now, format them into CSV with semicolons, making sure there are exactly 10 rows. Avoid any markdown and ensure the answers are concise. Double-check for any repetition or exceeding the word limit.
