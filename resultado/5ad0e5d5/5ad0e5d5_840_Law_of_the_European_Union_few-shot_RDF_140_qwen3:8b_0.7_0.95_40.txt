Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the provided context and facts. Let me start by understanding the context and the facts given.

The context talks about European Union law, its supranational nature, the 27 member states, the founding in 1952 as the European Coal and Steel Community, and the treaties that form its constitutional structure. It also mentions the Court of Justice of the European Union interpreting and creating case law.

The facts are in RDF format. Looking at the triples, there's information about academic disciplines related to Law of the European Union, scholars like Henry G. Schermers and John Bell, and some templates used on Wikipedia pages. The main subject here is Law of the European Union, its academic disciplines, and related scholars.

Now, I need to create questions that are varied and cover different aspects of the context and facts. Let's brainstorm possible questions:

1. What is the primary purpose of EU law? (Answer: Promote peace, social justice, etc.)
2. How many member states does the EU have? (Answer: 27)
3. When was the European Coal and Steel Community founded? (Answer: 1952)
4. What body interprets EU law? (Answer: Court of Justice of the EU)
5. What is the constitutional basis of EU law? (Answer: Treaties of the EU)
6. Who are some scholars associated with EU law? (Answer: Henry G. Schermers, John Bell)
7. What is the academic discipline related to EU law? (Answer: Law of the European Union)
8. What is the role of the Court of Justice of the EU? (Answer: Interprets and creates case law)
9. What is the main subject of the Wikipedia page? (Answer: Law of the European Union)
10. What templates are used on the EU law Wikipedia page? (Answer: Redirect_category_shell, etc.)

Wait, the answer for question 10 needs to be concise. The facts mention specific templates, but the answer should be short. Maybe list the templates as per the facts.

I need to ensure each question is unique and answers are derived from the context or facts. Also, check for repetition. Let me structure each line as per the example, using semicolons and keeping answers under 10 words. Let me verify each answer against the context and facts to ensure accuracy.
