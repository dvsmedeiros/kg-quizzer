Okay, so I need to create a quiz with 10 question-answer pairs based on the provided context about the Yuan dynasty. The instructions specify that each question should be in Portuguese and followed by a short answer, separated by a semicolon. Also, the answers must be either directly from the text or inferred from it.

First, I'll read through the abstract to understand the key points about the Yuan dynasty. It was established by Kublai Khan, part of the Mongol Empire, succeeded the Song dynasty, and preceded the Ming dynasty. The official name was Great Yuan, and they used various scripts like Chinese and 'Phags-pa.

Next, I'll look at the facts provided to find more specific details. For example, there's mention of the Battle of Lake Poyang, which is associated with the Yuan dynasty. Also, Kublai Khan died in 1294, and the dynasty ended in 1368 when they were defeated by the Ming.

I should make sure each question is unique and covers different aspects: establishment details, notable rulers, battles, succession, cultural elements like scripts used, etc. I'll avoid repeating similar questions to keep the quiz varied.

Let me outline possible questions:

1. When was the Yuan dynasty established?
2. Who was the founder of the Yuan dynasty?
3. What was Kublai Khan's role in the dynasty?
4. Which battle marked a significant event during their rule?
5. When did the Yuan dynasty end, and who overthrew them?
6. What script was used besides Chinese?
7. What was the official name of the dynasty?
8. What year did Kublai Khan die?
9. What were the religious beliefs practiced during the Yuan dynasty?
10. How long did the Yuan dynasty last in years?

I'll then ensure each answer is concise, within 10 words, and correctly references the context or inferred data.

Now, I'll format these into the required CSV structure with Portuguese questions and answers.
