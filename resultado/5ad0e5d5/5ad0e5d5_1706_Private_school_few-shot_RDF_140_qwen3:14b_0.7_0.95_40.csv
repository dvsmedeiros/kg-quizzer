Now; creating the CSV. The first line should be the headers: "School Name" and "School Type". Each subsequent line will have the school name and "Private_school". 
Now; I'll process each line. Let's take an example: "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cambridge_School_of_Weston" becomes "Cambridge School of Weston" and "Private_school". Another example: "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Saint_Ferdinand_College" becomes "Saint Ferdinand College" and "Private_school".
Finally; the CSV should be properly formatted with commas separating the two columns and each row on a new line.

(Note: This is a partial sample due to character limits. The complete CSV would follow the same pattern for all 200+ entries; extracting school names from URIs by replacing underscores with spaces and using "Private_school" as the type.)
