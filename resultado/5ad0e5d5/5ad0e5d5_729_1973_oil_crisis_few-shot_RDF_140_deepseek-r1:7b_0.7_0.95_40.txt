Okay, I'm trying to help the user generate a set of 10 questions and answers based on the provided context about the 1973 oil crisis. Let me break down what I need to do step by step.

First, I should understand the context thoroughly. The abstract mentions that in October 1973, OAPEC members, led by Saudi Arabia, proclaimed an oil embargo targeting nations that supported Israel during the Yom Kippur War. This led to countries like Canada, Japan, and the UK eventually joining. The price of oil sharply rose from about $3 per barrel to nearly $12 by March 1974.

Next, I need to look at the "fatos" (facts) provided. They include data about when the embargo ended in August 1971, the price increase details, and mentions of specific countries like Canada, Japan, Netherlands, UK, Portugal, Rhodesia, South Africa. There's also a mention of US involvement in an agreement during the conflict.

Now, my task is to create 10 unique questions that each have a correct answer based on this context. Each question should be clear and directly related to the facts provided.

I'll start brainstorming possible questions:

1. When did the first oil crisis occur? - Answer: October 1973.
2. Which country supported Israel during the Yom Kippur War and was targeted by the embargo? - Answer: Canada, Japan, Netherlands, UK, Portugal, Rhodesia, South Africa.
3. Who led the oil embargo in 1973? - Answer: Members of OAPEC, led by Saudi Arabia.
4. What was the approximate price increase of oil during the crisis? - Answer: From $3 to nearly $12 per barrel.
5. By when had more countries joined the oil embargo? - Answer: March 1974.
6. When did the US leave the Acordo de Bretton Woods? - Answer: August 15, 1971.
7. Which nation was a member of OAPEC and led the oil embargo? - Answer: Saudi Arabia.
8. What was the main cause of the oil crisis? - Answer: Support for Israel by nations like Canada, Japan.
9. How many countries initially targeted during the oil embargo? - Answer: 6 (Canada, Japan, Netherlands, UK, Portugal, Rhodesia, South Africa).
10. When did the price of oil reach nearly $12 per barrel? - Answer: March 1974.

I need to make sure each question is distinct and covers different aspects of the context. Also, I should ensure that the answers are accurate based on the provided information.

Let me double-check the facts:

- The embargo started in October 1973.
- Led by OAPEC, with Saudi Arabia as a key member.
- Targeted nations supported Israel during Yom Kippur War: Canada, Japan, Netherlands, UK, Portugal, Rhodesia, South Africa (total of seven countries).
- Price rose from $3 to nearly $12 in March 1974.
- The US left the Bretton Woods agreement in August 1971.
  
I think these cover all necessary points. Now, I'll format them into a CSV with each question and answer on separate lines, separated by a semicolon.

I also need to ensure that the questions are clear and direct, avoiding any ambiguity. Each should have only one correct answer based on the context provided.

Finally, I'll present this as a single CSV block without any additional formatting or explanation.
