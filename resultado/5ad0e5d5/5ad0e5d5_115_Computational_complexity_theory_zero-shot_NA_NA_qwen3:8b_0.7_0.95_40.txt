Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the given context about computational complexity theory. Let me start by understanding the context thoroughly.

The context talks about computational complexity theory, its focus on classifying problems by resource usage, related fields like P vs NP, and the distinction between analysis of algorithms and computational complexity. I should identify key concepts and terms here.

First, I'll list some main topics: computational complexity theory, resource usage classification, P vs NP problem, Millennium Prize Problems, analysis of algorithms vs computational complexity, computability theory, resource quantification (time, storage, communication, gates, processors), practical limits of computers, and the distinction between complexity theory and computability theory.

Now, I need to form questions that are relevant to these topics. Each question should have a concise answer, up to 10 words. Let me ensure the answers are accurate and directly from the context.

1. What is computational complexity theory focused on? → Classifying problems by resource usage.
2. What is a computational problem? → Task solved by a computer.
3. What is a key distinction between analysis of algorithms and computational complexity? → Resources needed by specific algorithms vs all possible algorithms.
4. What is the P versus NP problem related to? → Computational complexity theory.
5. Which field studies what problems can be solved algorithmically? → Computability theory.
6. What are resources like time and storage used for? → Quantifying computational complexity.
7. What are other measures of complexity besides time and storage? → Communication, gates, processors.
8. What is one of the roles of computational complexity theory? → Determining practical computer limits.
9. What is the Millennium Prize Problem dedicated to? → P versus NP problem.
10. How does computational complexity differ from computability theory? → Restricting available resources.

Wait, let me check if the answers are within 10 words. For example, the third answer is a bit long. Maybe rephrase: "Analyzing specific algorithms vs all possible algorithms." That's better. Also, ensure each question is clear and directly tied to the context. Let me verify each answer against the original text to ensure accuracy. Once that's done, format them into CSV with semicolons.
