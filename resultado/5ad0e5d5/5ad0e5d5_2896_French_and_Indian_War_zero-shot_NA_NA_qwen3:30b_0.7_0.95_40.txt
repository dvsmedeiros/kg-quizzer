Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs in Portuguese based on the given context about the French and Indian War. Let me start by understanding the context thoroughly.

First, the user wants the questions and answers in Portuguese, separated by semicolons. The answers should be short, up to 10 words. I need to make sure each question is relevant to the context provided.

Let me go through the context again. The French and Indian War was part of the Seven Years' War, involving British and French colonies with Native American allies. Key points include the population difference (60k vs 2 million), the role of Native allies, the start of the war with the Battle of Jumonville Glen, George Washington's role, the Battle of the Monongahela, the Acadian deportation, William Pitt's involvement, the capture of Quebec and Montreal, and the Treaty of Paris 1763.

Now, I'll list possible questions. For example, the population of French colonies, the main conflict area, the start of the war, key battles, the role of Native tribes, the Acadian expulsion, the treaty, etc.

I need to ensure that each answer is concise. Let me check each point:

1. Population of French colonies: 60,000 settlers.
2. Start of the war: Dispute over the Forks of the Ohio, Battle of Jumonville Glen in 1754.
3. Key battle where Washington was involved: Battle of Jumonville Glen.
4. British failure in 1755: Battle of the Monongahela.
5. Expulsion of Acadians: Ordered by William Shirley.
6. British military increase: William Pitt.
7. Capture of Quebec: 1759.
8. Treaty ending the war: Treaty of Paris 1763.
9. French ceded territory east of Mississippi to Britain.
10. Native tribes supporting French: Wabanaki Confederacy (Abenaki, Mi'kmaq), Algonquin, etc.

Now, I need to phrase these as questions in Portuguese, ensuring they are clear and the answers are short. Let me check for any possible errors or if I missed any key points. Also, make sure the answers are within 10 words. For example, "População das colônias francesas" would be answered with "Aproximadamente 60.000 colonos." That's under 10 words. 

I think that covers 10 questions. Let me verify each pair and ensure they are correctly formatted in CSV with semicolons.
