Okay, so I need to create a CSV file with 10 pairs of questions and answers based on the given context about Warsaw. The output should be in Portuguese, using semicolons as separators, and each line should have one question and one short answer.

First, I'll go through the provided context to understand what information is available. Warsaw is the capital of Poland, located on the Vistula River. It's a major city with a population of around 1.86 million, part of a larger metropolitan area. The city has a rich history, starting from a fishing town and becoming an important political and economic center.

Looking at the facts provided, there are many names of people who were born or died in Warsaw, places associated with the city, events held there, and various institutions and organizations based in Warsaw. There's also climate data, like temperatures and precipitation.

I need to create varied questions that touch on different aspects: geography, demographics, history, culture, economy, transportation, sports, etc. Each question should have a unique answer from the context.

1. **Geography**: What river flows through Warsaw? Answer is Vistula.
2. **Climate**: What's the maximum temperature in Warsaw in March? 22.9°C.
3. **Population**: How many people live in Warsaw? Around 1.86 million.
4. **Transportation**: Which metro line serves Okecie airport? Line M2.
5. **Economy**: What is Warsaw known for? Business services and IT.
6. **History**: When was the Old Town reconstructed? After WWII, but since it's mentioned in the context that it was listed as a World Heritage Site in 1980, maybe the reconstruction happened around then or earlier.
7. **Culture**: Which skyscraper is the tallest in Warsaw? Varso Tower (though the example mentions Varso Place, which might be different).
8. **Sports**: What's the name of Poland's national football stadium? Stadion Narodowy.
9. **Education**: Name a famous university in Warsaw. University of Warsaw.
10. **Government**: Where is the Prime Minister's office located? In Warsaw.

I need to make sure each question is clear and has one correct answer from the context. Also, avoid repeating similar questions. Let me structure these into CSV format now.
