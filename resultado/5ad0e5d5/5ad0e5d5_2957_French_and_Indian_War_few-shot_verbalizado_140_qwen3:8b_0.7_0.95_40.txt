Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the provided context and facts about the French and Indian War. Let me start by understanding the requirements. The user wants each question to be relevant, have a short answer (up to 10 words), and the answers must be derived from the given content. Also, I should avoid repeating similar questions.

First, I'll scan through the context and facts to identify key points. The context mentions the population of New France, the outcome of the war (Treaty of Paris 1763), the use of long rifles, key battles like Fort Ligonier and Fort Oswego, commanders like Edward Braddock and James Wolfe, and the involvement of indigenous groups like the Catawba and Cherokee. The facts list various participants, battles, and dates.

Now, I need to form questions that are specific and have clear answers from the text. Let me start with the population of New France. The context says "New France pertence à era French and Indian War" and "French and Indian War possui território New France," but I need to check the exact population figure. Wait, the facts mention "French and Indian War possui força 10000" which might refer to military strength, not population. Maybe I need to look for other details.

Wait, the context says "New France pertence à era French and Indian War" and "French and Indian War possui território New France." But the population isn't directly stated. Maybe I should focus on the outcome, like the Treaty of Paris. The context mentions "French and Indian War teve como resultado *Treaty of Paris (1763)" so that's a clear answer. Also, the date is given as "French and Indian War possui data 1754-05-28" which might be the start date.

Another point is the use of long rifles: "Long rifle foi usado na guerra French and Indian War." That's a direct fact. Battles like Fort Ligonier and Fort Oswego are listed in the facts. Commanders like Edward Braddock and James Wolfe are mentioned. Also, the involvement of indigenous groups like the Catawba and Cherokee.

I need to ensure each answer is concise. Let me list possible questions:

1. Which treaty ended the French and Indian War? (Answer: Treaty of Paris 1763)
2. What was the population of New France during the war? (Not sure, maybe not directly stated)
3. Which battle was fought at Fort Ligonier? (Answer: Battle of Fort Ligonier)
4. Who was a key commander during the war? (Answer: Edward Braddock)
5. What weapon was commonly used? (Answer: Long rifle)
6. Which indigenous group was involved? (Answer: Catawba)
7. What was the start date of the war? (Answer: 1754-05-28)
8. Which battle involved the Siege of Louisbourg? (Answer: Siege of Louisbourg)
9. Who was the commander of the British forces in the Battle of Quebec? (Answer: James Wolfe)
10. What was the outcome of the war? (Answer: Treaty of Paris 1763)

Wait, some answers might be too long. For example, the outcome is the treaty. Also, the start date is given. I need to make sure answers are under 10 words. Let me adjust:

1. Which treaty ended the French and Indian War? (Answer: Treaty of Paris 1763)
2. What was the start date of the French and Indian War? (Answer: 1754-05-28)
3. Which weapon was used in the war? (Answer: Long rifle)
4. Who was a key commander? (Answer: Edward Braddock)
5. Which indigenous group fought? (Answer: Catawba)
6. What was the outcome of the war? (Answer: Treaty of Paris 1763)
7. Which battle involved Fort Ligonier? (Answer: Battle of Fort Ligonier)
8. Who led the British at the Battle of Quebec? (Answer: James Wolfe)
9. Which territory was part of the war? (Answer: New France)
10. What was the population of New France? (Not sure, maybe skip or find another fact.)

Wait, the facts mention "French and Indian War possui força 10000" which might refer to military strength, not population. Maybe another fact: "French and Indian War teve baixas 1,512 killed in action" but that's casualties, not population. So maybe the population question isn't answerable. Let me adjust the list to avoid that. Focus on the treaty, start date, weapon, commanders, battles, and territories. That should give me 10 questions. Let me check for duplicates and ensure answers are accurate.
