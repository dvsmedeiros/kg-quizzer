Ok, I need to generate 10 question;answer pairs in CSV format based on the provided context and facts. Each question should be relevant to the topic of Islamism, and the correct answer must be concise, with a maximum of 10 words. The output should be exactly 10 lines following the specified CSV structure.

First, I'll review the context and facts provided. The context explains that Islamism is a political ideology aiming for a reconstitution of society according to Islamic principles. It mentions various movements and their ideologies, such as the Muslim Brotherhood, Hezbollah, Hamas, and others. The facts list specific organizations and their ideologies, along with related information like images or texts associated with them.

I need to ensure that each question is unique and covers different aspects of Islamism. I'll start by identifying key concepts from the context and facts: definitions, goals, methods, influential figures, examples of movements, and significant events or outcomes associated with Islamism.

Next, I'll formulate questions around these concepts. For example:
1. What is considered a primary goal of Islamist movements? Answer: Re-establishment of Islamic law.
2. Which organization is often labeled as an example of political Islam? Answer: Muslim Brotherhood.
3. What does the term "islamismo" refer to in some contexts? Answer: Political ideology.

I'll make sure each answer is accurate and directly inferred from the provided context or facts. I also need to avoid repeating similar questions and ensure a variety in the topics covered, such as different movements, goals, strategies, and impacts of Islamism.

Finally, I'll structure each line correctly with "pergunta;resposta" format, using semicolons as separators and ensuring no markdown is used.
