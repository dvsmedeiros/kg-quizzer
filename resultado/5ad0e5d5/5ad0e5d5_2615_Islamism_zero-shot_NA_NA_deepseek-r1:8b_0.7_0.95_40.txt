Ok, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the provided context about Islamism. Let me read through the context carefully to find relevant information.

First, I should identify key points from the context. It mentions that Islamism is a political ideology advocating for the application of Islamic principles in governance, economics, and judiciary aspects. It also talks about two strategies: revolutionary (using state power) or reformist (grassroots activism). The goal is to implement sharia, pan-Islamic unity, and remove non-Muslim influences seen as Western neocolonialism.

There's a mention of authors preferring terms like Islamic activism over Islamism due to media portrayal. Figures such as Rached Ghannouchi use "Islamic movement." Prominent figures include Sayyid Rashid Rida, Hassan al-Banna, Sayyid Qutb, Abul A'la Maududi, Hasan al-Turabi, and Ruhollah Khomeini. Some movements like the Muslim Brotherhood use peaceful processes, while others, like Qutb's followers, are considered extremists but denounced for killing innocents.

The term has been debated in public and academic contexts. It refers to diverse forms of activism aiming to guide public life by Islamic principles. In academia, it doesn't specify the vision or methods.

Now, I should create questions that cover these points. Let me think of 10 relevant questions:

1. What is Islamism primarily defined as?
2. What are the two main strategies for implementing Islamic principles?
3. Which term is preferred by some authors instead of Islamism?
4. What does "Islamic movement" mean according to Rached Ghannouchi?
5. Who are some central figures in 20th-century Islamism?
6. How do some movements like the Muslim Brotherhood approach their goals?
7. What is sharia in the context of Islamism?
8. Why have some analysts described Islamism as identity politics?
9. Which term is associated with the belief that Western influences harm Islamic societies?
10. How does the meaning of "Islamism" differ between public and academic contexts?

Now, I need concise answers for each. Let me ensure they are under 10 words each.
