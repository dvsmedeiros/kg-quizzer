Ok, eu preciso transformar a lista de escolas em um arquivo CSV. Primeiro, vou olhar para a lista que foi fornecida. Vejo que há muitos links e algumas tags que identificam os tipos de escolas.

Primeiro, separarei cada linha individualmente para ter uma entrada por escola. Em seguida, identificarrei qual é a localização e o tipo da escola. Por exemplo, a primeira escola menciona "Mount Aviat Academy" com tipo "Private school", então na CSV, isso será representado como Mount Aviat Academy, Private school.

Depois, para cada entrada, vou precisar garantir que a denominação e o tipo estejam corretamente formatados. Além disso, devo verificar se há duplicated ou informações inconsistentes. Por exemplo, vejo que há uma "The Patrick School" com dois nomes, mas acho que isso pode ser um erro de digitação, talvez deva only usar o nome completo.

Também vou observar se todas as entradas têm os campos necessários: Nome da Escola e Tipo. Algumas entradas mencionam "ns1:schooltype" ou "ns2:type", então preciso extrair a informação de maneira consistente, independentemente do formato original.

Depois de organizar todas as informações, vou formatar o CSV com duas colunas: uma para o nome e outra para o tipo. Vou começar a lista, cada linha correspondendo a uma escola com suas respectivas informações.

Finalmente, farei uma revisão geral para garantir que todo o conteúdo foi incluído corretamente sem erros de formatação.
