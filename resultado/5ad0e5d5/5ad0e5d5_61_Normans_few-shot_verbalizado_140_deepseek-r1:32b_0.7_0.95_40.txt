Okay, so I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs in Portuguese based on the provided context about the Normans. Let me start by reading through the abstract and facts carefully.

First, the abstract mentions that Normans originated from intermingling between Norse Viking settlers and indigenous West Franks and Gallo-Romans. That gives a good starting point for a question about their origin.

Next, I see that Rollo was a leader who agreed to swear fealty to King Charles III in 911 after the siege of Chartres. That's a key historical event, so maybe ask about when the Normans were recognized as a legitimate group.

The abstract also talks about the Norman conquests, like England and Sicily, which could be another question. I can ask where the Normans established themselves beyond Normandy.

Looking at the facts, I notice that the Normans spoke Old Norman, which evolved into Norman French. That's a good linguistic point for a question about their language.

The religious aspect is mentioned as well; they were known for their Catholic piety after adopting Christianity. So, asking about their religion makes sense.

I also see information about the Norman military impact and their architectural style, Romanesque. That could be another question focusing on their cultural contributions.

Another point from the facts is that Normans influenced various regions like the Near East and Scotland through their expeditions and conquests. This can lead to a question about their influence beyond Europe.

The Channel Islands are still considered remnants of the Duchy of Normandy, so asking how they're connected today could work.

There's mention of the Norman language still being spoken in parts of Normandy and the Channel Islands. That’s another linguistic aspect for a question.

Lastly, the abstract mentions that by the late 10th century, Normans had become Frenchmen in essentials, adopting their customs. So a question about when they merged with Frankish culture fits here.

I need to make sure each question is unique and covers different aspects: origin, recognition, conquests, language, religion, military influence, architectural style, remaining territories, modern language, and cultural merger.

Now, I'll translate these into Portuguese questions and answers, ensuring each answer is concise and within the context provided.
