Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the given context about the Huguenots. Let me start by reading through the context carefully to understand the key points.

The Huguenots were French Protestants, part of the Reformed tradition. They were persecuted, leading to the French Wars of Religion. The Edict of Nantes granted them autonomy, but later, under Louis XIV, their rights were revoked. They faced persecution, some converted, others fled as refugees, leading to a significant decline in their population. The Edict of Versailles in 1787 ended persecution.

Now, I need to create questions that are relevant to this information. Each question should have a short answer, no more than 10 words. Let me brainstorm possible questions:

1. What religion did the Huguenots follow?
2. When did the French Wars of Religion occur?
3. What was the Edict of Nantes?
4. Who was a leader of the Huguenots?
5. What did Louis XIV do to the Huguenots?
6. What happened to the Huguenots after the Edict of Fontainebleau?
7. Why did the Huguenots flee France?
8. What was the result of the Huguenot exodus?
9. When did persecution of Protestants end in France?
10. What was the main cause of the Huguenot decline?

Now, I need to ensure the answers are accurate and concise. Let me check each one against the context:

1. Reformed/Calvinist Protestantism. Correct.
2. 1562 to 1598. Correct.
3. Granted Huguenots autonomy. Correct.
4. Jeanne d'Albret, Henry IV, Princes of Condé. Correct.
5. Revoked rights, dragonnades, Edict of Fontainebleau. Correct.
6. Forced to convert or flee. Correct.
7. Persecution and violence. Correct.
8. Brain drain, loss of societal roles. Correct.
9. 1787 with Edict of Versailles. Correct.
10. Persecution due to religious conflicts. Correct.

I should make sure the answers are in Portuguese and within the word limit. Also, the format must be CSV with each line as "question;answer". Let me structure them accordingly.
