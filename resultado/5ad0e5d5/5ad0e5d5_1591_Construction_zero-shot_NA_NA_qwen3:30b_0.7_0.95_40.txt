Okay, the user wants me to generate 10 question-answer pairs in Portuguese based on the given context about construction. Let me start by understanding the context thoroughly.

First, the context explains that construction is the art and science of forming objects, systems, or organizations. It mentions the origin of the word from Latin and Old French. The process includes planning, financing, design, building, and maintenance. The industry's economic impact is highlighted, with figures like $11 trillion annually and 13% of global GDP. Also, it's noted as one of the most hazardous industries, with 20% of US industry fatalities in 2019.

Now, I need to create questions that cover these points. Let me brainstorm possible questions. For example, the origin of the word "construction" – that's a good one. Then, the main stages of construction, the economic contribution, the percentage of GDP, the main hazards, etc.

I need to make sure each answer is concise, under 10 words. Let me check each question to ensure they are relevant and the answers are accurate. Also, the format must be CSV with semicolons. Let me verify the example given to match the structure.

Wait, the user specified "ponto e vírgula" which is semicolon. So each line should be "pergunta;resposta". I need to avoid any markdown and just output the CSV.

Let me list out the possible questions:

1. Where does the word "construction" originate from?
2. What are the main stages of construction?
3. What percentage of global GDP does construction represent?
4. What is the main hazard in the construction industry?
5. What was the global construction expenditure in 2012?
6. What is the projected construction expenditure in 2030?
7. What is the main economic contribution of the construction industry?
8. What is the term for the act of building?
9. What is the term for the nature of a structure?
10. What is the main focus of construction activities?

Now, crafting the answers:

1. Latin "constructio" and Old French.
2. Planning, financing, design, building, maintenance.
3. 13% of global GDP.
4. High number of fatalities.
5. About $4 trillion.
6. Around $14.8 trillion.
7. Economic development and non-monetary benefits.
8. Construct.
9. Construction.
10. Building, infrastructure, industrial facilities.

Wait, the 10th question needs to be concise. Maybe "What does construction involve?" Answer: Building, infrastructure, industrial facilities.

Let me check each answer length. For example, "Latin 'constructio' and Old French" is 6 words. Good. "Planning, financing, design, building, maintenance" is 6 words. "13% of global GDP" – 4 words. "High number of fatalities" – 5 words. "About $4 trillion" – 4 words. "Around $14.8 trillion" – 5 words. "Economic development and non-monetary benefits" – 7 words. "Construct" – 1 word. "Construction" – 1 word. "Building, infrastructure, industrial facilities" – 6 words.

Looks good. Now, format them as CSV. Make sure there are exactly 10 pairs. No markdown, just the CSV. Let me double-check the example provided by the user to match the structure. Yes, each line is "pergunta;resposta" with semicolons. No extra spaces. Alright, that should do it.
