Okay, so I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs in Portuguese based on the provided context about the Yuan dynasty. Let me start by reading through the context carefully to understand the key points.

The Yuan dynasty was a Mongol-led empire in China from 1271 to 1368, established by Kublai Khan. It succeeded the Mongol Empire and preceded the Ming dynasty. The Mongols had been ruling parts of northern China for decades before Kublai officially declared the dynasty. The Southern Song fell in 1279 after the Battle of Yamen. After being defeated by the Ming, the Yuan retreated to Mongolia and continued as the Northern Yuan until 1635.

Kublai Khan used both Chinese and Mongolian languages, with some emperors using 'Phags-pa script. The Yuan is the first non-Han dynasty to rule all of China proper. They traced their succession back to Genghis Khan, who was given the temple name Taizu. Kublai also claimed supremacy over other khanates but this was mostly nominal.

Now, I need to create questions and answers that cover these points. Let me think of different aspects: when it started, key rulers, important events like the fall of the Southern Song, language use, succession after defeat, etc.

1. When was the Yuan dynasty established? 1271.
2. Who founded it? Kublai Khan.
3. What year did the Yuan end? 1368.
4. Which dynasty did they succeed? The Mongol Empire.
5. Which battle ended the Southern Song? Battle of Yamen in 1279.
6. After defeat, where did Yuan rulers retreat? Mongolia.
7. How long did the Northern Yuan last? Until 1635.
8. What language did some emperors use? Mongolian and 'Phags-pa script.
9. Which dynasty came after Yuan in China? Ming.
10. Who was considered the founder by the Yuan? Genghis Khan (Temujin).

I should make sure each question is clear and each answer concise, as per instructions. Also, format them correctly with semicolons and in Portuguese.
