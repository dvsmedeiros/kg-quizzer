Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the provided context about Ctenophora. Let me start by reading through the context carefully to identify key points.

First, the context mentions that Ctenophora are marine invertebrates known as comb jellies, noted for their cilia used for swimming. That's a good starting point for a question about their common name and characteristic feature.

Next, the context states that they are the largest animals using cilia for swimming. That can be another question about their size relative to other ctenophore swimmers.

The number of validated species is 100-150, with possibly 25 more un-described. That's a fact that can be turned into a question about the number of species.

The textbook example is cydippids with egg-shaped bodies and retractable tentacles with colloblasts. That's a specific detail that can be asked about their structure.

Their body composition is a jelly mass with two-cell layers. That's another point for a question on anatomy.

Body forms include cydippids, platyctenids, and beroids. That can be a question about the different body forms.

Predatory behavior is mentioned, except for two species' juveniles. That's a question about exceptions in their diet.

Fossils date back to the early Cambrian, 525 million years ago. That's a question about their fossil record.

The debate about their position in the tree of life, with two hypotheses: Porifera Sister and Ctenophora Sister. That's a good question on the evolutionary placement.

Lastly, the analysis by Pisani and Whelan about gene differences affecting computer algorithms. That's a question on the genetic factors influencing studies.

Now, I need to ensure each question is concise and the answers are short, up to 10 words. Let me check each point again to make sure I didn't miss any key information and that the answers are accurate based on the context.
