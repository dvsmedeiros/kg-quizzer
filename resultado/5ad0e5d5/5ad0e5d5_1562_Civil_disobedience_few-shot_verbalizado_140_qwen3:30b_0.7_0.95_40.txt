Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs in Portuguese based on the given context about civil disobedience. Let me start by reading through the context and the facts provided.

The context explains that civil disobedience is the refusal to obey certain laws, often nonviolent, and mentions historical examples like Henry David Thoreau, Gandhi, and Martin Luther King Jr. The facts list various events and movements that used civil disobedience methods, such as the 2017 Serbian protests, the Women in the Yellow Vests movement, and others.

First, I need to create questions that are relevant and have a single correct answer. The answers should be short, up to 10 words. Let me brainstorm possible questions.

1. Who is associated with the term "Civil Disobedience" in the US? (Henry David Thoreau)
2. What movement in the 1960s used civil disobedience? (Civil Rights Movement)
3. Which country's revolution involved civil disobedience against British rule? (India)
4. What is the main goal of civil disobedience? (Protest against unjust laws)
5. Who was a key figure in the Indian independence movement using civil disobedience? (Gandhi)
6. What was the name of the movement in the US against the Vietnam War? (Anti-war protests)
7. Which event in 2020 involved civil disobedience related to police brutality? (George Floyd protests)
8. What is the term for refusing to follow laws in a nonviolent way? (Nonviolent resistance)
9. Which historical event in South Africa used civil disobedience? (Apartheid)
10. Who was a leader in the Egyptian Revolution of 1919? (Saad Zaghloul)

Now, I need to check if these answers are present in the context or can be inferred. For example, the context mentions Gandhi in 1920s India, so that's correct. The Civil Rights Movement is mentioned as using civil disobedience. The example of the 2017 Serbian protests is in the facts, so that's a valid question. The George Floyd protests are mentioned in the facts as using civil disobedience. 

I should ensure that the questions are varied and not repetitive. Also, check the answers are concise. Let me adjust any that might be too long. For example, "Protest against unjust laws" is 5 words. "Nonviolent resistance" is 2 words. 

Now, format them into CSV with semicolons. Make sure each line has "pergunta;resposta" and there are exactly 10 lines. Avoid any markdown and just output the CSV.
