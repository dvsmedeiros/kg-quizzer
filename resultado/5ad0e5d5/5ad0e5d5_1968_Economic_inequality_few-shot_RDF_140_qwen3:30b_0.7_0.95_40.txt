Okay, I need to generate 10 pairs of questions and answers in Portuguese based on the given context about economic inequality. Let me start by understanding the context provided.

The context talks about different types of economic inequality, like income and wealth inequality. It mentions measurements such as the Gini coefficient and the Inequality-adjusted Human Development Index. There's also information about how globalization affects inequality between and within countries. The facts section includes various resources and triples related to economic inequality, like books, people, and events.

First, I should identify key points from the context and facts. For example, the Gini coefficient is a widely used measure. The context states that globalization reduced global inequality but increased within-nation inequality. Also, taxes and transfers in advanced economies decrease income inequality by one-third.

I need to make sure each question is unique and covers different aspects. Let me brainstorm possible questions:

1. What is a common measure of economic inequality? (Answer: Gini coefficient)
2. What has increased within nations despite global inequality reduction? (Answer: Inequality within nations)
3. What percentage do taxes and transfers reduce income inequality in advanced economies? (Answer: one-third)
4. What is the name of the index that considers inequality in human development? (Answer: Inequality-adjusted Human Development Index)
5. What did the context say about the distribution of income and wealth? (Answer: Income inequality and wealth inequality)
6. What is the effect of economic inequality on growth? (Answer: Hinders economic growth)
7. What is the main focus of the Nathan Cummings Foundation? (Answer: Economic inequality)
8. Which book discusses economic inequality? (Answer: Capital in the Twenty-First Century)
9. What is the main idea of the "Occupy" movements? (Answer: Economic inequality)
10. What did the context mention about the distribution of wealth? (Answer: 1% of people own 40% of assets)

Wait, the example answers have specific numbers. Let me check the context again. The context mentions "the Gini coefficient being a widely used one" and "inequality within most nations has risen significantly." Also, "taxes and transfers decrease income inequality by one-third."

I need to ensure answers are concise, under 10 words. Let me adjust the questions and answers accordingly. For example, instead of "What is a common measure of economic inequality?" maybe "Qual é um método comum para medir desigualdade econômica?" with answer "O coeficiente Gini."

Check for repetition. Make sure each question is different. Use the facts from the triples, like the Nathan Cummings Foundation's focus on economic inequality. Also, mention specific books like "Capital in the Twenty-First Century" and "The Hidden Wealth of Nations."

Avoid using the same answer structure. Some answers can be numbers, others concepts. Ensure all answers are inferable from the context provided. For example, the context says "90 percent of advanced economies have seen an increase in inequality," but the example answer might be "aumentou significativamente" (increased significantly).

Double-check that each answer is accurate based on the context. For instance, the answer about taxes reducing inequality by one-third is directly from the context. Also, the Inequality-adjusted Human Development Index is mentioned as an index that considers inequality.

Now, structure each pair as "Pergunta? Resposta." in Portuguese, ensuring they are clear and concise.
