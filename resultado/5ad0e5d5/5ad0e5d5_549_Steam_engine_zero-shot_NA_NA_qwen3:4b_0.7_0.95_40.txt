Okay, the user wants me to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the provided context about steam engines. Let me start by understanding the context thoroughly.

The context explains what a steam engine is, how it works, its history, key inventors, and its applications. I need to create questions that test semantic knowledge, so they should be specific and require understanding of the content, not just general knowledge.

First, I'll identify key points from the text. The steam engine uses steam pressure to push a piston, converting it into rotational force. The Rankine cycle is the ideal thermodynamic cycle. The context mentions different inventors: Jerónimo de Ayanz y Beaumont, Thomas Savery, Thomas Newcomen, and James Watt. Also, the transition from steam engines to electric motors and internal combustion engines in the 20th century.

Now, I need to form questions around these points. Each question should have a concise answer. Let me brainstorm possible questions:

1. What is the main working fluid in a steam engine?
2. How does a steam engine convert steam pressure into mechanical work?
3. What is the ideal thermodynamic cycle for analyzing steam engines?
4. Who patented the first steam-powered water pump?
5. What was the key improvement made by James Watt?
6. What replaced steam engines in power generation?
7. When did steam engines become dominant in industrial applications?
8. What were the reasons for the decline of steam engines in the 20th century?
9. What is the primary function of a connecting rod and crank in a steam engine?
10. What was the first commercially successful steam engine?

I need to ensure the answers are accurate and within 10 words. Let me check each answer against the context:

1. Steam is the working fluid. Correct.
2. Using a connecting rod and crank to convert reciprocating motion to rotational. Correct.
3. Rankine cycle. Correct.
4. Jerónimo de Ayanz y Beaumont. Correct.
5. Removed spent steam to a separate vessel for condensation. Correct.
6. Steam turbines. Correct.
7. 19th century. Correct.
8. Electric motors and internal combustion engines. Correct.
9. Convert reciprocating motion to rotational force. Correct.
10. Thomas Newcomen. Correct.

Now, I'll format them into the CSV structure, making sure each line is a question followed by the answer, separated by a semicolon. No extra text, just the CSV. Let me double-check that all answers are under 10 words and the questions are relevant. Looks good. Time to put them all together.
