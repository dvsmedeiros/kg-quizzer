Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the provided context about the 1973 oil crisis. Let me start by understanding the context given.

The context mentions that the crisis began in October 1973 with an embargo by OAPEC members targeting nations supporting Israel during the Yom Kippur War. The embargo affected countries like the US, UK, Japan, etc. The oil price rose from $3 to nearly $12 per barrel by March 1974. It's also called the "first oil shock," followed by the 1979 crisis as the "second oil shock." The embargo ended in March 1974, leading to economic impacts and political changes.

Now, the facts provided include various Wikipedia templates and categories, but the main content is in the context. I need to avoid repeating similar questions. Let me brainstorm possible questions:

1. When did the 1973 oil crisis start? (Answer: October 1973)
2. Which organization led the embargo? (OAPEC)
3. What was the oil price increase by March 1974? (nearly 300%)
4. What term was used for the 1973 crisis? (first oil shock)
5. Which countries were initially targeted? (Canada, Japan, UK, US, Netherlands)
6. What was the oil price in March 1974? (US$12 per barrel)
7. When was the embargo lifted? (March 1974)
8. What was the impact on global politics? (effects on global politics and economy)
9. Who were the main countries supporting Israel? (Nations that supported Israel during Yom Kippur War)
10. What was the significance of the crisis? (led to second oil shock in 1979)

Wait, some of these might be similar. Let me check for variety. The example given in the instructions includes questions about the start date, price, terms, embargo proclamers, reasons for separation, Nixon's negotiation, Kissinger's date, embargo lifting, US leaving Bretton Woods. But the user's context doesn't mention Bretton Woods, so maybe avoid that. Let me focus on the context provided.

I need to ensure each question is unique and answers are directly from the context. Let me list 10:

1. When did the 1973 oil crisis begin?;October 1973
2. Which organization led the oil embargo?;Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries
3. What was the oil price in March 1974?;nearly US $12
4. What was another name for the 1973 crisis?;first oil shock
5. Which countries were initially targeted by the embargo?;Canada, Japan, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and the United States
6. What caused the oil crisis?;oil embargo by OAPEC
7. When was the embargo lifted?;March 1974
8. What was the price increase from October 1973 to March 1974?;nearly 300%
9. Which event led to the embargo?;Yom Kippur War
10. What was the impact of the crisis on global politics?;effects on global politics and economy

Wait, the answer to question 6 might be better phrased as "oil embargo by OAPEC members." Also, question 9's answer should mention the Yom Kippur War. Let me adjust to ensure accuracy and conciseness. Also, check for duplicates. The example had questions about the embargo proclamers, which is covered in question 2. Also, the example included the embargo's target countries, which is question 5. Need to make sure all answers are within the context. Let me finalize the 10 pairs.
