Okay, the user wants me to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the provided context about packet switching. Let me start by understanding the context thoroughly. The key points are: packet switching groups data into packets with headers and payloads, it's the basis for computer networks, Paul Baran's contribution in the 1960s, Donald Davies coining the term, and its incorporation into ARPANET.

I need to create 10 relevant questions. Let me brainstorm possible questions. First, what is packet switching? Then, who developed it? What are the components of a packet? What's the purpose of the header? How does it differ from traditional methods? When was it developed? Who coined the term? What's the significance of ARPANET? What's the main advantage? And what's the role of the payload?

Now, I need to ensure the answers are concise, up to 10 words. Let me check each question and answer. For example, "What is packet switching?" answer: "Method of grouping data into packets." That's 6 words. Good. 

Next, "Who developed packet switching?" Answer: "Paul Baran in the 1960s." That's 5 words. 

For components of a packet: "Header and payload." Perfect. 

Header's purpose: "Directs packets to destination." 

Difference from traditional: "Contradicted pre-allocation." 

Development time: "Early 1960s." 

Term coined by: "Donald Davies." 

ARPANET's role: "Incorporated packet switching." 

Main advantage: "Efficient fault-tolerant routing." 

Payload's role: "Extracted by operating systems." 

Wait, the payload is used by OS, apps, or higher protocols. Maybe "Used by OS and applications." But that's 5 words. 

I need to make sure each answer is accurate and concise. Let me double-check the context. Yes, the payload is extracted and used by OS, apps, or higher protocols. So "Used by OS and applications." That's 5 words. 

Okay, all answers are within the word limit. Now, format them as CSV with semicolons. Make sure there are no extra spaces or formatting issues. Let me list them out in order.
