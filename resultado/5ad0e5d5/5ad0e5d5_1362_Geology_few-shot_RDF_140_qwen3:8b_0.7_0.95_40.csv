For example; the line:
4. Ensure that all entries are included; even if they have multiple objects for the same predicate.
I need to be careful with the splitting. For example; a line like:
Similarly; the line:
Has three objects here; each needing to be a separate row.
- For each object; create a row in the CSV.
Now; I'll proceed to process each line of the provided data and generate the CSV accordingly.
