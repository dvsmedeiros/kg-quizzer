Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the provided context about British Satellite Broadcasting (BSB). The context is in English, but the questions and answers need to be in Portuguese. 

First, I need to understand the context thoroughly. BSB was a UK-based TV company that started in 1990 and merged with Sky Television to form British Sky Broadcasting. Key points here are the company's name, headquarters, start date, merger details, and the resulting company.

Next, I have to create questions that cover these points. Each question should be relevant and not too broad. For example, asking about the headquarters, the start date, the merger date, and the name of the merged company. I need to ensure that the answers are concise, under 10 words each. 

Now, translating these into Portuguese. I'll need to make sure the terminology is correct. "Headquartered in London" becomes "sediada em Londres". The merger date is "2 de novembro de 1990". The resulting company is "British Sky Broadcasting".

I should also consider other aspects like the service type (direct broadcast satellite television services), which in Portuguese is "serviços de televisão por satélite direto ao consumidor". The merger partner is "Sky Television plc".

I need to avoid repetition and ensure each question addresses a unique piece of information. Let me check if there are enough distinct points. Yes, there are several: headquarters, start date, merger date, merged company, services provided, merger partner, headquarters location, formation of new company, original name, and the year of merger.

Now, phrasing each question clearly. For example, "Qual foi a data de início das transmissões da BSB?" for the start date. Answers should be direct, like "25 de março de 1990".

I must ensure that the CSV format is correct, using semicolons and proper line breaks. Also, check for any typos or grammatical errors in the Portuguese answers. Each answer should be a short phrase, not a full sentence. 

Let me list out all the possible questions and answers based on the context points. Then arrange them in the CSV format as specified. Make sure there are exactly 10 pairs, each on a separate line after the header. Double-check that the example provided is followed correctly.
