Okay; let's tackle this. The user provided a bunch of RDF triples and wants a CSV generated from them. The main goal is to extract information about steam engines and related entities.
Starting with the Steam_engine entity. The triple says it has wikiPageUsesTemplate with several templates. So in the CSV; I'll list each template as a separate row for the Steam_engine entity under the wikiPageUsesTemplate attribute.
Then there's the hypernym; which is Engine. That's another single value.
For the depictions; there are multiple URLs. Each of these should be a separate entry under the depiction attribute for the Steam_engine entity.
Similarly; other ships like USS_Vanderbilt have powerType as Steam_engine. So each of those will be entries in the CSV under their respective entities.
I should also check for any other entities that might be in the data. For instance; the USS_Westfield_(1861) is another ship with shipPropulsion. All these need to be included.
