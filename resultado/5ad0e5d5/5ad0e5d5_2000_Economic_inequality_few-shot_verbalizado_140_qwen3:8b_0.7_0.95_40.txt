Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the provided context and facts. Let me start by understanding the context. The context talks about economic inequality, measuring it through income and wealth, the Gini coefficient, the Inequality-adjusted Human Development Index, and how globalization affects inequality between and within nations. It also mentions studies linking inequality to political instability and slower economic growth.

Now, looking at the facts, there are a lot of entries related to Economic inequality, like Branko Milanović, the Kuznets curve, images like the wealth distribution, and various references to studies and authors. But the main focus should be on the context provided. 

I need to make sure the questions are varied and cover different aspects of the context. Let's brainstorm some possible questions. For example, the context mentions that income inequality peaked in the 1970s and has been converging since then. That could be a question. Another point is that taxes and transfers decrease income inequality by one-third. Also, the Gini coefficient is mentioned as a measure. 

Wait, the example given in the user's message includes questions about the Oxfam report, but the context here doesn't mention Oxfam. So I should stick to the provided context. Let me check the context again. It talks about the Gini coefficient, the Inequality-adjusted Human Development Index, globalization reducing global inequality but increasing within nations, and the link between inequality and economic growth. 

Possible questions could be: What is a common measure of economic inequality? (Gini coefficient). When did income inequality between nations peak? (1970s). How much did taxes and transfers reduce income inequality? (one-third). What is the Inequality-adjusted Human Development Index? (a composite index considering inequality). How has globalization affected inequality between and within nations? (reduced global, increased within). What factors are linked to economic inequality? (political instability, slower growth). 

Wait, the user's example includes specific numbers, so maybe include those. For example, the context says that 90% of advanced economies saw increased income inequality. But I need to check if that's in the context. Let me re-read the context. Yes, "close to 90 percent of advanced economies have seen an increase in income inequality, with over 70% recording an increase in their Gini coefficients exceeding two points." So a question could be about that. 

Also, the context mentions that inequality within nations has risen significantly in the last 30 years. Another point is that economic inequality is at the center of policy debates. 

Let me list possible questions and their answers based on the context:

1. What is a widely used measure of economic inequality? (Gini coefficient)
2. When did income inequality between nations peak? (1970s)
3. How much do taxes and transfers reduce income inequality in advanced economies? (one-third)
4. What is the Inequality-adjusted Human Development Index? (composite index considering inequality)
5. How has globalization affected income inequality between and within nations? (reduced global, increased within)
6. What factors are linked to economic inequality? (political instability, slower growth)
7. What percentage of advanced economies saw increased income inequality? (90%)
8. What is the impact of economic inequality on economic growth? (hinders growth)
9. What is the main focus of economic policy debates regarding inequality? (government tax and spending policies)
10. What has happened to income levels across countries since the 1970s? (converging to middle-income)

Now, I need to make sure the answers are concise, up to 10 words. Let me check each answer length. For example, "Gini coefficient" is short. "1970s" is okay. "One-third" is good. "Composite index considering inequality" is a bit long, maybe "composite index that accounts for inequality" would be better. 

Wait, the example answers are like "40%", "cerca de 3,5 bilhões de pessoas", etc. So maybe the answers should be concise, even if they are phrases. Let me adjust the answers to be as short as possible. For example, question 4 could be "What is the Inequality-adjusted Human Development Index?" and answer "composite index that accounts for inequality." But maybe even shorter: "statistic composite index that accounts for inequality." Wait, the original context says "Inequality-adjusted Human Development Index, which is a statistic composite index that takes inequality into account." So the answer could be "statistic composite index that accounts for inequality."

Another question: "What is the main effect of economic inequality on growth?" Answer: "hinders economic growth and macroeconomic stability." But that's longer. Maybe "hinders economic growth." 

I need to ensure each answer is under 10 words. Let me finalize the 10 questions and answers, ensuring they are based on the context and vary in focus.
