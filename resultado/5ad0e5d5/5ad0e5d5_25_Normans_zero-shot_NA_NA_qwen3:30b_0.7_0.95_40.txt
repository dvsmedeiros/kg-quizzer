Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs in Portuguese based on the given context about the Normans. Let me start by reading through the context carefully to identify key points.

First, the Normans were a mix of Norse Vikings and indigenous people in Normandy. The term also refers to those who conquered other territories like England and Sicily. Rollo's agreement with King Charles III in 911 is important. The Norman identity formed in the 10th century, and they had a big impact on Europe and the Near East. Their language evolved into Norman French. The Duchy of Normandy was a fief of France, and there's mention of the Channel Islands as the last remnants. The Norman conquest of England in 1066, the Battle of Hastings, and their influence in Sicily, the Iberian Reconquista, and the Crusader states are all key points.

Now, I need to form questions that target these points. The answers should be concise, up to 10 words. Let me list possible questions:

1. Who were the Normans? (Answer: Descendentes de Viking e Frankos)
2. When did Rollo swear fealty? (Answer: 911, após o cerco de Chartres)
3. What term describes their identity? (Answer: Identidade normanda)
4. Which territories did they conquer? (Answer: Inglaterra e Sicília)
5. What language did they adopt? (Answer: Normando francês)
6. When was the Duchy of Normandy established? (Answer: Tratado de Saint-Clair-sur-Epte)
7. Who was Richard I of Normandy? (Answer: "Richard sem Medo")
8. When did the English lose mainland Normandy? (Answer: 1204, por Felipe II)
9. What are the last remnants of the Duchy? (Answer: Ilhas do Canal)
10. What is their legacy? (Answer: Línguas e instituições europeias)

I need to check that each answer is under 10 words and in Portuguese. Also, ensure the questions are clear and directly related to the context. Let me verify each pair.
