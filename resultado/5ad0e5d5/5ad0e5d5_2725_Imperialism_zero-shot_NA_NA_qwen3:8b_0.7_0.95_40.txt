Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the given context about imperialism. Let me start by understanding the context thoroughly. The context explains that imperialism involves extending power through territorial acquisition, political/economic control, using both hard and soft power. It's distinct from colonialism and empire but related.

First, I'll identify key concepts from the text. The main points are: definition of imperialism, distinction from colonialism and empire, use of hard and soft power, methods of expansion (territorial acquisition, political control), and the state policy aspect.

Now, I need to create questions that test understanding of these points. Each question should have a concise answer. Let me brainstorm possible questions:

1. What is imperialism defined as? → Extending power through control and territory.
2. What are the methods of imperialism? → Territorial acquisition and political control.
3. How does imperialism differ from colonialism? → It's distinct but related.
4. What is hard power in imperialism? → Economic and military power.
5. What is soft power in imperialism? → Cultural and diplomatic influence.
6. What is the primary goal of imperialism? → Extending power and dominion.
7. What forms of expansion does imperialism include? → Various forms of government and control.
8. What is a key aspect of imperialism? → State policy and practice.
9. How is imperialism achieved? → Through hard and soft power.
10. What's the relationship between imperialism and empire? → It's a distinct concept.

Wait, some answers might be too long. Let me check the word limit. Answers should be under 10 words. Let me refine:

1. What is imperialism? → Extending power through control and territory.
2. What methods does imperialism use? → Territorial acquisition and political control.
3. How does imperialism differ from colonialism? → It's distinct but related.
4. What is hard power? → Economic and military power.
5. What is soft power? → Cultural and diplomatic influence.
6. What is the primary goal? → Expanding power and dominion.
7. What forms of expansion? → Various government and control methods.
8. What is a key aspect? → State policy and practice.
9. How is imperialism achieved? → Through hard and soft power.
10. Relationship to empire? → Distinct concept related to empire.

Now, I need to ensure each question is clear and the answers are accurate. Let me check for duplicates and ensure each answer is concise. Also, verify that the answers directly relate to the context provided. Once satisfied, format them into CSV with semicolons.
