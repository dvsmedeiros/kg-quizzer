Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs in Portuguese based on the provided context, triples, and few-shot examples. Let me start by reviewing the context thoroughly. The IPCC is an intergovernmental body under the UN, established by WMO and UNEP in 1988. It has 195 member states, a secretariat in Geneva, and focuses on climate change science. The key points from the context include its establishment, structure, assessment cycles, reports, and its role in climate negotiations.

Now, looking at the triples, there's a lot of metadata like the chair, headquarters, and various classifications. However, the user wants questions based on the context, not just the triples. The few-shot examples given are about the IPCC's parent organizations, resolutions, presidents, and reports. So I need to ensure that the questions are varied and cover different aspects of the IPCC.

Let me brainstorm possible questions:

1. What is the main function of the IPCC? (Based on the context's mention of advancing scientific knowledge about climate change)
2. Which organizations established the IPCC? (WMO and UNEP)
3. Where is the secretariat located? (Geneva, Switzerland)
4. How many member states does the IPCC have? (195)
5. What is the duration of an assessment cycle? (6-7 years)
6. What is the role of the bureau? (Selects experts for reports)
7. What does the IPCC not do? (Conduct original research)
8. What is the significance of the Fifth Assessment Report? (Influenced the Paris Agreement)
9. When did the sixth assessment cycle start? (2015)
10. What was the first special report in the sixth cycle? (Global Warming of 1.5°C in 2018)

I need to make sure the answers are concise, in Portuguese, and directly from the context. Let me check each question against the context to confirm accuracy. Also, avoid repetition and ensure each question is unique and covers different areas. For example, the first few examples in the few-shot were about the parent organizations, resolutions, and presidents. To vary, I can include structure, functions, reports, and historical events.

Now, translating the questions into Portuguese and ensuring the answers are correctly phrased. For example, "Quais organizações estabeleceram o IPCC?" with "a Organização Meteorológica Mundial (OMM) e o Programa das Nações Unidas para o Meio Ambiente (PNUMA)".

I need to ensure that each answer is under 10 words and uses the exact terms from the context. Also, check that the CSV format is correct with semicolons and proper line breaks. Let me compile the list, making sure there are exactly 10 pairs without repetition.
