Okay, the user wants me to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the provided context about the Huguenots. Let me start by carefully reading the instructions and the given materials.

First, the context is about the Huguenots, their history, the French Wars of Religion, key figures, and events. The facts provided include some RDF triples, but maybe the main info is in the abstract. The example given has questions about where they were concentrated, the Edict of Nantes, the term's origin, etc.

I need to make sure each question is unique and covers different aspects. Let me brainstorm possible topics: origin of the term, key events (like the Edict of Nantes, St. Bartholomew's Day massacre), their geographical distribution, key leaders, the impact of Louis XIV's policies, the decline in numbers, related terms like dragonnades, and their influence beyond France.

Check the example responses to see the style. They are concise, under 10 words. For instance, "as partes sul e central da França" for where they were concentrated. I need to ensure answers are short and directly from the context.

Now, looking at the abstract, key points:

- Term derived from Bezanson Hugues.
- Concentrated in south and west.
- Edict of Nantes granted autonomy.
- Persecution under Louis XIV, Edict of Fontainebleau.
- Numbers declined from 10% to 1,000.
- Led by Jeanne d'Albret, Henry IV, princes of Condé.
- French Wars of Religion from 1562-1598.
- Dragonnades used to convert Protestants.
- Exile led to brain drain.
- Edict of Versailles in 1787 ended persecution.

Possible questions:

1. Origin of the term "Huguenots" – Bezanson Hugues.
2. Where were they concentrated? South and west of France.
3. Edict ending the wars? Edict of Nantes.
4. Who led them? Jeanne d'Albret, Henry IV, Condé princes.
5. When were the wars? 1562-1598.
6. What did the Edict of Fontainebleau do? Revoked Protestant rights.
7. Decline in numbers? From 10% to 1,000.
8. What were dragonnades? Forced conversions.
9. When did persecution end? Edict of Versailles 1787.
10. Key event leading to decline? St. Bartholomew's Day massacre.

Wait, the example had "St. Bartholomew's Day massacre in 1572" as a point. Maybe include that. Also, check if the answers are in the context. For example, the term's origin is mentioned as possibly from Hugues. The Edict of Nantes ended the wars. The Edict of Fontainebleau revoked rights. The numbers declined from 10% to 1,000. The wars were 1562-1598. Dragonnades were used under Louis XIV. The Edict of Versailles in 1787 ended persecution. The St. Bartholomew's Day massacre in 1572 is mentioned as a key event.

Need to ensure each answer is concise. Let me draft the questions and answers, checking against the context to make sure they are accurate and not repeating. Also, avoid using the same structure as the example. For instance, instead of "When were the wars?" maybe "Quando ocorreram as Guerras da Religião?" as in the example, but vary the phrasing.

Double-check for uniqueness. For example, one question about the term's origin, another about geographical concentration, another about the Edict of Nantes, another about the leaders, the wars' duration, the Edict of Fontainebleau, the decline in numbers, dragonnades, the end of persecution, and maybe the impact of the massacre.

Yes, that should cover 10 distinct points. Now, format them into CSV with semicolons. Make sure no markdown, just plain text. Check the example's format. Each line is "pergunta;resposta".
