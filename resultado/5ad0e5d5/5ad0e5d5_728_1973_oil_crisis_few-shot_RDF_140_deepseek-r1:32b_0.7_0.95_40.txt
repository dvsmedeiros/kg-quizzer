Okay, I need to create a quiz based on the 1973 oil crisis using the given information and facts. Let me start by understanding the context thoroughly.

The abstract mentions that the crisis began in October 1973 when OAPEC members imposed an embargo on countries supporting Israel during the Yom Kippur War. The initial targets were Canada, Japan, Netherlands, UK, and US. Later, it extended to Portugal, Rhodesia, and South Africa. The oil price rose nearly 300%, from $3 to almost $12 per barrel.

Looking at the facts, there are various classifications like economic disasters, embargoes, energy crises, etc. There's also mention of templates related to financial crises, portals, and specific dates up to July 2022.

I should generate varied questions covering different aspects: causes, key players, effects, timeline, price changes, countries involved, consequences, related policies, and historical significance.

I need to ensure each question has a clear, short answer based on the provided info. Let's outline potential questions:

1. When did the oil crisis start?
2. Which organization led the embargo?
3. What was the main reason for the embargo?
4. How much did oil prices increase?
5. What was the initial price per barrel?
6. Which countries were initially targeted?
7. Who extended the embargo later?
8. What were some effects of the crisis?
9. When did the embargo end?
10. What term was used to describe this event?

Wait, I should check if all answers are directly from the context or can be inferred. For example, the countries involved and the duration of the embargo.

Also, ensure no repetition in question types. Maybe include one about economic impacts or political consequences.

Now, let's draft each pair:

1. Start date: October 1973.
2. Leading organization: Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries (OAPEC).
3. Reason: Support for Israel during Yom Kippur War.
4. Price increase percentage: nearly 300%.
5. Initial price: US$3 per barrel.
6. Targeted countries: Canada, Japan, Netherlands, UK, US.
7. Later included: Portugal, Rhodesia, South Africa.
8. Effects: Short- and long-term effects on economy and politics; oil shock.
9. End date: March 1974.
10. Term used: first oil shock.

I think that covers the key points without repetition. Each answer is concise and directly from the context.
