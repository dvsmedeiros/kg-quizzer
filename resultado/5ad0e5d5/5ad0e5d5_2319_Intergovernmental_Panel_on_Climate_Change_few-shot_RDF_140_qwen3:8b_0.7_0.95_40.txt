Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the provided context about the IPCC. First, I need to understand the context thoroughly. The context mentions the IPCC's establishment by WMO and UNEP in 1988, its role in climate change research, the structure with three working groups, the Nobel Prize in 2007, and recent reports like the Sixth Assessment. 

Now, the user provided some example questions and answers, so I need to follow that structure. Each question should be unique and cover different aspects. Let me list out possible topics: establishment, key organizations, location, members, leadership, reports, Nobel Prize, assessment cycles, working groups, and special reports.

I need to ensure each question has a single correct answer derived from the context. For example, "Which organizations established the IPCC?" would be answered with WMO and UNEP. I should avoid repetition and check that answers are concise, up to 10 words. Also, the language must be Portuguese, and the separator is a semicolon. 

Let me go through the context again to extract key points. The secretariat is in Geneva, hosted by WMO. Member states are 195, and the leader is Hoesung Lee. The Fifth Assessment Report influenced the Paris Agreement, and the Sixth Assessment is ongoing. The Special Reports on 1.5°C, Climate Change and Land, and Ocean and Cryosphere are mentioned. 

I need to make sure the answers are directly from the text. For instance, the first question about the parent organizations should be WMO and UNEP. Another question could be about the Nobel Prize year, which is 2007. Also, the Sixth Assessment's start and end years are 2015-2023. 

I should avoid similar questions. For example, one about the leader and another about the vice-president. Wait, the example includes questions about the president and vice-president, so I can include those. Also, the first president was Bert Bolin. 

Let me check the facts section for any additional info. The facts mention Rajendra Pachauri's occupation, but the context says he was the president until 2015. So a question about his resignation date would be February 2015. 

I need to ensure each answer is a direct quote or inference from the context. For example, the location is Geneva, Switzerland. The secretariat is hosted by WMO. The IPCC's role is to inform governments about climate change impacts. 

Now, compiling all these into 10 unique questions. Let me list them:

1. Which organizations established the IPCC? → WMO and UNEP
2. Where is the IPCC's secretariat located? → Geneva, Switzerland
3. How many member states does the IPCC have? → 195
4. Who is the current leader of the IPCC? → Hoesung Lee
5. Which Nobel Prize did the IPCC share in 2007? → Nobel Peace Prize
6. When did the IPCC begin its sixth assessment cycle? → 2015
7. What is the name of the IPCC's first special report? → Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C
8. Which report highlighted irreversible climate changes? → Working Group I contribution to AR6
9. When was the Paris Agreement influenced by? → Fifth Assessment Report
10. Who was the first president of the IPCC? → Bert Bolin

Wait, some answers might need to be adjusted for conciseness. For example, the answer to question 8 should be the specific report mentioned. Also, check if all answers are within 10 words. Let me verify each one against the context to ensure accuracy.
