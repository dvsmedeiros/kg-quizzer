Okay; I need to generate a CSV file based on the user's instructions and rules. Let me start by understanding the requirements.
- ns1:imageCaption "The Rhine in Basel; Switzerland"
Wait; but the example in the user's message had entries like:
- ns1:imageCaption "The Rhine in Basel; Switzerland"
- ns1:subdivisionType "Countries"; "Rhine Basin"
- dcterms:subject <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:France–Germany_border>; etc.
- foaf:depiction <http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Above_Tomasee.jpg>; etc.
Same for the wikiPageUsesTemplate; which lists multiple templates. Each should be a separate row.
The same applies to dcterms:subject; which has multiple categories.
For example; <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Template:As_of> becomes "Template:As_of".
Similarly; <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:France–Germany_border> becomes "Category:France–Germany_border".
4. For the "wikiPageUsesTemplate" and other predicates with multiple values; split them into separate rows.
Now; let's go through each triple and apply this.
Now; putting all these into the CSV.
Same for dcterms:subject; etc.
This would result in a large number of rows; but that's what the user's example showed.
Here's the structured CSV output based on the provided triples and abstract; following the required format:
