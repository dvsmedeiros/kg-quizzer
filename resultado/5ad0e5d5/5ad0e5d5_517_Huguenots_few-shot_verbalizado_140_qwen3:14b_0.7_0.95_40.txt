Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the provided context about the Huguenots. Let me start by reading through the context carefully to identify key points.

First, the Huguenots were French Protestants following the Reformed or Calvinist tradition. The term might be derived from a Swiss leader, Bezanson Hugues. They were concentrated in southern and western France. The French Wars of Religion lasted from 1562 to 1598. The Edict of Nantes granted them autonomy, but later under Louis XIV, the Edict of Fontainebleau revoked their rights. They faced persecution, leading many to flee. The Edict of Versailles in 1787 ended official persecution, and the Declaration of the Rights of Man in 1789 gave them equal rights.

Now, I need to create varied questions that cover these points. Let me list possible topics: origin of the term, location, religious affiliation, key events (Edict of Nantes, Edict of Fontainebleau), leaders (Jeanne d'Albret, Henry IV), timeline of the wars, impact of Louis XIV's policies, the brain drain effect, and the eventual rights restoration.

Each question should have a concise answer from the context. I must ensure answers are under 10 words and not repeated. Let me check for duplicates and ensure each question is unique. For example, one question could ask about the religious tradition, another about the leader the term is derived from, another about the location of the population, etc.

I should also use the triples and facts provided. For instance, the term's origin from Bezanson Hugues, the Edict of Nantes, the Edict of Fontainebleau, the wars' duration, the Edict of Versailles, and the brain drain. Also, note that they were mainly in southern and western France, not eastern areas which were Lutheran.

Now, drafting the questions and answers, making sure each answer is directly from the context. Let me count to ensure there are exactly 10 pairs without repetition. Checking for grammar and correct use of semicolons. Alright, that should cover it.
