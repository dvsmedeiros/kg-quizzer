Okay; so I need to generate a CSV based on the given RDF data about Victoria (Australia). Let me first understand what's provided.
Looking at the data; it's an RDF description of Victoria with some specific properties:
- The main entry is <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Victoria_(Australia)>; with properties febRecordHighC and marRecordHighC.
- All other URIs like <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Albury;_Victoria> have a location predicate pointing to Victoria.
