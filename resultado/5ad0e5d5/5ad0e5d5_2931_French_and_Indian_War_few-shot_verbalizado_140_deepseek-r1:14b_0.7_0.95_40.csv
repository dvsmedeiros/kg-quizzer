Okay; so I need to create a CSV with 10 question-answer pairs about the French and Indian War based on the provided context and triples. Let me start by understanding what's given.
1. **Duration**: The war started in 1754; so a question about when it began makes sense.
3. **Outcome**: The Treaty of Paris ended it; which is an important fact.
4. **Casualties**: The context mentions around 1;500 deaths.
I need to phrase these as questions and answers; making sure they're clear and concise. I'll avoid any overlap and ensure each question targets a different aspect. Let me structure them one by one.
Now; putting it all together into the CSV format with proper escaping for quotes if needed.
