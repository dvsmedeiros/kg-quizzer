Okay, so I need to create a quiz with 10 question pairs in CSV format based on the given context about civil disobedience. Let me start by understanding what each part requires.

First, each pair should have one question and one correct short answer. The language has to be Portuguese. Also, they need to be separated by semicolons and listed as per the example.

Looking at the context provided, it's about the concept of civil disobedience, including its history, associated figures, and some quotes from notable individuals like Thoreau, Gandhi, King, etc. I'll need to create questions that test understanding of these points.

I'll begin by identifying key terms: civil disobedience, nonviolent resistance, leaders who used it (Thoreau, Anthony, Zaghloul, Gandhi), examples like the Egyptian Revolution and Indian independence, quotes from King and Bevel, and maybe some related concepts like penalties for disobedience or the difference between civil disobedience and other forms of rebellion.

I'll structure each question to cover these areas. For example, a question about the historical context with Thoreau's essay could be paired with "Civil Disobedience". Another one might ask who was inspired by that concept, relating to Anthony. Then there are questions about specific events or quotes—King and Bevel's role in the civil rights movement, Gandhi's opposition to British rule.

I also need to make sure each answer is concise, fitting within 10 words. I should avoid making the questions too broad but ensure they're clear enough for someone with basic knowledge of the topic to understand.

Let me list out possible topics:
1. Definition and purpose of civil disobedience
2. Historical figure associated with its definition (Thoreau)
3. Figure influenced by Civil Disobedience concept (Anthony, Zaghloul, Gandhi)
4. Examples of civil disobedience in history (Egyptian Revolution, India)
5. Figures involved in modern civil rights movements (King, Bevel)
6. Relevant quotes from Thoreau or King
7. Penalties for civil disobedience

Wait, the last point about penalties isn't explicitly mentioned in the context but might be inferred. Alternatively, I can focus on whether it's justifiable in court.

Now, let me draft each question and answer pair step by step:

1. **Question**: What is civil disobedience?  
   **Answer**: It involves breaking a law when it's morally wrong to do so.

2. **Question**: Who is associated with the concept of Civil Disobedience through his essay "Resistance to Civil Government"?  
   **Answer**: Henry David Thoreau

3. **Question**: Which leader was inspired by Thoreau’s Civil Disobedience?  
   **Answer**: Susan B. Anthony

4. **Question**: What is a significant event in history linked to civil disobedience?  
   **Answer**: Egyptian Revolution of 1919 against British Occupation

5. **Question**: Which modern leader was part of the civil rights movement in the US?  
   **Answer**: Martin Luther King Jr.

6. **Question**: Who wrote, "Any man who breaks a law that conscience tells him is unjust and willingly accepts the penalty by staying in jail to arouse the conscience of the community on the injustice of the law is at that moment expressing the very highest respect for the law."  
   **Answer**: Martin Luther King Jr.

7. **Question**: What does the term "Resist" mean in the context of civil disobedience?  
   **Answer**: To display reverence for law by breaking it intentionally.

8. **Question**: Which figure is associated with nonviolent resistance during India's independence?  
   **Answer**: Mahatma Gandhi

9. **Question**: What does King consider civil disobedience to be?  
   **Answer**: A form of displaying reverence for law, not violence.

10. **Question**: Which event in the 1960s United States involved civil disobedience for civil rights?  
    **Answer**: March on Washington

Wait, I think "Resist" is a good term to use as it relates directly to the concept of displaying respect despite breaking the law. That should cover all the areas without overlapping too much.

I should ensure that each answer matches exactly with what's in the context, avoiding any confusion. Also, making sure that each question is clear and directly related to the context provided.
