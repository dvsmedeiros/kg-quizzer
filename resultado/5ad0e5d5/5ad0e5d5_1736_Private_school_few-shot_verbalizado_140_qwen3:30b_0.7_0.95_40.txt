Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs in Portuguese based on the given context about private schools. Let me start by understanding the context provided.

The context says that a private school, or independent school, is not administered or funded by the government, unlike public schools. They are not dependent on national or local government for their financial endowment. They typically have a board of governors and a system of governance ensuring their independent operation.

Now, looking at the facts, there are a lot of examples of private schools in different countries. The task is to create questions and answers that are relevant, varied, and based on the context, triples, or few-shot examples.

First, I need to make sure each question is unique and covers different aspects. Let me think of possible angles:

1. Definition of private schools.
2. Funding sources.
3. Governance structure.
4. Examples of private schools in specific regions.
5. Differences between private and public schools.
6. Terminology used in different regions.
7. Costs or other characteristics.

Let me check the examples given in the few-shot. They have questions like "What is another term for private schools?" with answers like "independent," or "What is the annual cost of some notable preparatory schools in New England?" with "$45,000."

So I need to create similar questions but using the provided context and facts.

First question: What is another name for private schools? Answer: independent schools.

Second: What do private schools not rely on for funding? Answer: government funding.

Third: What do private schools typically have? Answer: a board of governors.

Fourth: What is a characteristic of private schools? Answer: independent operation.

Fifth: What is a term used in some regions for private schools? Answer: independent schools.

Wait, but I need to ensure the answers are short (up to 10 words) and based on the context.

Another angle: Examples of private schools in specific countries. But the facts list many schools, but the context doesn't mention specific countries. However, in the few-shot example, there's a question about which country doesn't refer to universities as private schools, like Australia. But in the current context, there's no mention of countries. So maybe focus on the definition and structure.

Another question: What is the main difference between private and public schools? Answer: not government-funded.

But the context says private schools are not administered or funded by the government. So the answer could be "not administered or funded by the government."

But need to check if that's within 10 words. "Not administered or funded by the government" is 6 words, so okay.

Another question: What is a key feature of private schools? Answer: independent operation.

Another: What do private schools have instead of government funding? Answer: a board of governors.

Wait, the context says "typically have a board of governors and have a system of governance that ensures their independent operation."

So maybe: What do private schools typically have? Answer: a board of governors.

Another question: What is the main source of funding for private schools? Answer: private funding.

But the context says they are not dependent on government, so the answer could be "private funding" or "not government funding."

But the exact answer from the context is "not administered or funded by the government," but that's a longer answer. However, the user's examples have shorter answers like "independent" or "acadêmicas".

Alternatively, the answer could be "private funding" or "self-funded".

But need to make sure the answer is inferable from the context. The context says they are not dependent on government for funding, so the answer could be "private funding" or "not government-funded".

But the example answers are very concise. For example, "independentes" in the example.

So maybe the answer for "What is another name for private schools?" is "independent schools".

Another question: What is the main difference between private and public schools? Answer: not government-funded.

But need to check if that's correct. The context says private schools are not administered or funded by the government, so the answer is "not administered or funded by the government" but that's longer than 10 words. So maybe "not government-funded" (5 words).

Another question: What do private schools have instead of government administration? Answer: independent governance.

But the context says "have a board of governors and have a system of governance that ensures their independent operation."

So maybe: What do private schools have? Answer: a board of governors.

Another question: What is a key aspect of private schools' operation? Answer: independent operation.

Another question: What is the main source of funding for private schools? Answer: private funding.

But the context doesn't explicitly mention "private funding," but it's implied since they are not government-funded.

Alternatively, the answer could be "not government-funded."

But the user's examples have answers like "mas escolas" (but schools) which is a bit unclear. Maybe the answer here is "private funding" or "self-funded."

I need to make sure each question is unique and covers different aspects. Let me list 10 possible questions:

1. What is another term for private schools? Answer: independent schools.
2. What do private schools not rely on for funding? Answer: government funding.
3. What do private schools typically have? Answer: a board of governors.
4. What is a key feature of private schools? Answer: independent operation.
5. What is the main difference between private and public schools? Answer: not government-funded.
6. What is the main source of funding for private schools? Answer: private funding.
7. What do private schools have instead of government administration? Answer: independent governance.
8. What is a characteristic of private schools' governance? Answer: board of governors.
9. What is the term for schools not funded by the government? Answer: private schools.
10. What is the main aspect of private schools' independence? Answer: independent operation.

Wait, but some of these might be similar. Let me check for variety.

Alternatively:

1. What is another name for private schools? Answer: independent schools.
2. What is the main source of funding for private schools? Answer: private funding.
3. What do private schools have instead of government funding? Answer: private funding.
4. What do private schools typically have? Answer: a board of governors.
5. What is the main difference between private and public schools? Answer: not government-funded.
6. What is a key feature of private schools? Answer: independent operation.
7. What is the term for schools not administered by the government? Answer: private schools.
8. What do private schools use for governance? Answer: board of governors.
9. What is the main aspect of private schools' structure? Answer: independent governance.
10. What is a characteristic of private schools' funding? Answer: not government-funded.

But some answers might be redundant. Need to ensure each pair is unique and covers different aspects.

Let me now structure them properly in CSV format, ensuring each answer is under 10 words and based on the context.
