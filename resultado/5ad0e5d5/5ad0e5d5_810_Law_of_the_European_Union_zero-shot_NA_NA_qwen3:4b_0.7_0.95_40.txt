Okay, the user wants me to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the provided context about European Union law. Let me start by understanding the context thoroughly. The key points are that EU law is a supranational system with 27 member states, originated from the European Coal and Steel Community in 1952, aims for peace, social justice, a social market economy, full employment, and environmental protection. The Treaties form the constitutional structure, and the Court of Justice of the EU interprets it.

Now, I need to create questions that test knowledge of these points. Each question should be concise, and the answers need to be short, under 10 words. Let me brainstorm possible questions. 

First, the origin of EU law. The context says it started with the European Coal and Steel Community in 1952. That's a good starting point. Then, the main objectives: peace, social justice, social market economy, full employment, environmental protection. The Treaties of the EU are the constitutional structure. The Court of Justice is the judicial branch that interprets EU law.

I should make sure each question is unique and covers different aspects. Let me check if I have 10 distinct points. Maybe start with the origin, then the objectives, the constitutional structure, the judicial branch, and others. Let me list them out:

1. Origin of EU law
2. Main objectives of EU law
3. Constitutional structure of EU
4. Judicial branch for EU law
5. Number of member states
6. Purpose of the European Coal and Steel Community
7. Key areas of focus for EU law
8. Role of Treaties in EU
9. Interpretation of EU law
10. Historical foundation of EU law

Wait, that's 10. Now, I need to phrase them as questions and make sure the answers are accurate and concise. Let me check each one:

1. When was EU law founded? Answer: 1952 (from the European Coal and Steel Community).
2. What are the main goals of EU law? Answer: Peace, social justice, etc.
3. What forms the EU's constitutional structure? Answer: Treaties of the European Union.
4. Which body interprets EU law? Answer: Court of Justice of the EU.
5. How many member states does the EU have? Answer: 27.
6. What was the purpose of the European Coal and Steel Community? Answer: Promote peace and economic cooperation.
7. What key areas does EU law focus on? Answer: Social market economy, employment, environment.
8. What is the role of the Treaties? Answer: Establish the EU's constitutional framework.
9. Which branch creates EU case law? Answer: Judicial branch (Court of Justice).
10. What is the historical foundation of EU law? Answer: European Coal and Steel Community.

I think that's all. Now, I need to format them into the CSV as per the example. Make sure each line is in the format "question;answer". Check for any typos or inaccuracies. Also, ensure the answers are under 10 words. Let me count:

For example, answer to question 2: "Peace, social justice, social market economy, full employment, environmental protection." That's 10 words. Wait, the user said the answer must be under 10 words. So maybe shorten it. Alternatively, "Peace, justice, economy, employment, environment." That's 5 words. But the original context lists them as five points. Maybe the answer can be a concise list. Alternatively, the answer could be "Promote peace, social justice, etc." But the user wants the answer to be correct and short. Let me check the original context again.

Original context: "to promote peace, social justice, a social market economy with full employment, and environmental protection." So the answer could be "Peace, justice, economy, employment, environment." But that's five words. Alternatively, "Peace, social justice, economy, employment, environment." That's 5 words. Wait, the original has "a social market economy with full employment" which is part of the objectives. So maybe the answer is "Peace, social justice, economy, employment, environment." That's 5 words. So that's acceptable.

Alternatively, the answer could be "Promote peace, social justice, etc." but that's 5 words. I think that's okay. Let me proceed with that. Now, I need to make sure each answer is correct and concise. Once that's done, format them into the CSV.
