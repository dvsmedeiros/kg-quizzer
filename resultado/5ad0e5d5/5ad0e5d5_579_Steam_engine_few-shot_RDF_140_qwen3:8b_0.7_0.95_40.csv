Okay; I need to generate a CSV file based on the provided data. Let me start by understanding the data structure and the user's instructions. 
3. Handle all relevant entries; including the "dcterms:subject" and "ns3:hypernym" for "Steam_engine".
4. Ensure that each property is listed as a separate row; even if there are multiple objects for the same predicate.
First; the "Steam_engine" subject has several predicates:
But the user mentioned including the "Steam_engine" entry as a subject. That entry is part of the data; so it should be included. 
Therefore; the CSV should include all these triples. 
Now; the challenge is to convert the entire dataset into a CSV with the correct headers and rows. 
- The URIs are correctly formatted; possibly with quotes if needed.
I need to ensure that all the triples from the provided data are included; with each triple as a row.
