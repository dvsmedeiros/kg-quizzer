Okay, the user wants me to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the provided context about Jacksonville. Let me start by carefully reading the context to understand the key points.

The context mentions that Jacksonville is located on the Atlantic coast of northeast Florida, is the most populous city in the state, and the largest by area in the contiguous U.S. It also talks about the consolidation with Duval County in 1968, population figures, the St. Johns River, historical European settlements, the French colony of Fort Caroline, the British settlement at Cow Ford, naming after Andrew Jackson, military bases, and the economy.

I need to create questions that test semantic knowledge, so they should be based on specific details from the text. Each question should have a short, correct answer (up to 10 words). Let me brainstorm possible questions:

1. What is the population of Jacksonville as of 2020?
   Answer: 949,611

2. Which river does Jacksonville straddle?
   Answer: St. Johns River

3. What is the name of the French colony located in the area?
   Answer: Fort Caroline

4. What was the original name of the settlement near the Cow Ford?
   Answer: Wacca Pilatka

5. When was the town established after the U.S. gained Florida from Spain?
   Answer: 1822

6. What is the name of the military base near Jacksonville?
   Answer: Naval Station Mayport

7. What is the largest military presence in the U.S. related to Jacksonville?
   Answer: Naval Submarine Base Kings Bay

8. What is the main economic activity in Jacksonville?
   Answer: Tourism, particularly golf

9. Who was the city named after?
   Answer: Andrew Jackson

10. What is the nickname for people from Jacksonville?
    Answer: Jacksonvillians

Now, I need to ensure that each answer is concise and directly derived from the context. I should check for accuracy and that the questions are indeed based on the provided information. Also, the format needs to be exactly as specified: one question per line, separated by a semicolon, no extra text. Let me confirm each answer again against the context to avoid mistakes. Once that's done, I can format them into the CSV structure.
