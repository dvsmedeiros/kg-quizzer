Okay, so I need to create 10 pairs of questions and answers in a CSV format based on the provided context about Pharmacy. The questions should be varied and cover different aspects of the topic. Let me go through the process step by step.

First, I'll read through the abstract given. It talks about pharmacy as both a science and practice, involving various roles like discovering, producing, dispensing medications. It also mentions the difference between community and institutional pharmacies and touches on clinical services.

Looking at the facts provided, there are many examples of companies and organizations related to Pharmacy, such as Wegmans, Fidesco Group, etc., which provide pharmacy services or products. There's also information about pharmacists' roles, education, and different branches like molecular pharmaceutics.

Now, I need to create 10 questions that cover these aspects. Let me brainstorm some topics:

1. **Definition of Pharmacy**: What is the primary goal of pharmacy?
2. **Practice Settings**: What are two main settings where pharmacy practice occurs?
3. **Ancillary Sciences**: Which fields does pharmacy connect with?
4. **Modern Services in Pharmacy**: What kind of modern services do pharmacists offer besides dispensing medications?
5. **Primary Role of Pharmacists**: What is the primary role of a pharmacist?
6. **Historical Context**: What historical figure is associated with early pharmaceutical practices?
7. **Education and Training**: What does the education and training for pharmacists focus on?
8. **Scope of Practice**: What are some traditional roles within pharmacy practice?
9. **Community Pharmacy Example**: Name a U.S. company that sells medicines in their stores.
10. **Global Terms**: What is another term used for pharmacists in some countries?

I think these topics cover the key points from the context and the facts provided. Now, I'll formulate each question and find the corresponding answer based on the information given.

For example, for the first question: The primary goal of pharmacy is to ensure safe, effective, and affordable use of medicines. So the answer would be "ensure safe, effective, and affordable use of medicines."

I'll make sure each question is unique and covers different aspects, avoiding repetition. Each answer should be concise, up to 10 words.

Let me list them out:

1. **What is the main goal of pharmacy?**  
   Answer: Ensure safe, effective, and affordable use of medicines.
