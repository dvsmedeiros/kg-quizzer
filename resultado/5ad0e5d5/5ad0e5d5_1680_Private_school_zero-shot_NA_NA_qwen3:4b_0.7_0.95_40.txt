Okay, the user wants me to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the given context about private schools. Let me start by understanding the context thoroughly.

The context explains that a private school isn't government-administered or funded, unlike a public school. It mentions that private schools aren't dependent on government financing and usually have a board of governors for governance. So, the key points are: not government-run, not funded by government, independent operation, board of governors.

Now, I need to create 10 relevant questions. Each question should be in Portuguese, and the answers should be short, up to 10 words. Let me brainstorm possible questions. 

First, the main difference between private and public schools. Then, what funds private schools? Next, what governs them? Maybe questions about their independence, the role of a board of governors, and whether they are government-funded. Also, what ensures their independent operation? And maybe why they aren't dependent on government funding. 

I need to make sure each question is unique and covers different aspects of the context. Let me check if I have 10 distinct questions. Let me list them out:

1. What is a private school not administered by?
2. What does a private school not depend on for funding?
3. What ensures the independent operation of private schools?
4. How are private schools typically governed?
5. What is the main difference between private and public schools?
6. What type of school is not funded by the government?
7. What is the role of a board of governors in private schools?
8. What ensures private schools are independent?
9. What is the primary source of funding for private schools?
10. What is the main characteristic of private schools?

Now, I need to translate these into Portuguese, ensuring the answers are concise. Let me check each answer's length. For example, the answer to the first question would be "governo" (government), which is one word. That's good.

Wait, the example given in the instructions had answers like "não é governamental" (not governmental). So maybe the answers need to be in Portuguese but concise. Let me make sure each answer is under 10 words. Also, the questions should be in Portuguese, but the answers should be in Portuguese as well. 

Let me go through each question and answer again to ensure they fit the criteria. For example, the answer to the fifth question: "Diferença principal entre escolas privadas e públicas é a administração governamental." That's 10 words. Okay.

I think that's all. Now, I'll format them into the CSV as specified, making sure each line is a question followed by the answer, separated by a semicolon, and there are 10 lines. Let me double-check that there are exactly 10 pairs and that each answer is short.
