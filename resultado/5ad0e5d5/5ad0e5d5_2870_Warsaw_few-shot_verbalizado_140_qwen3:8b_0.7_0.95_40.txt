Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the provided context about Warsaw. Let me start by understanding the requirements. The user wants each question to be related to the context, have a short correct answer (up to 10 words), and use Portuguese. The separator is a semicolon, and the output should be exactly 10 lines.

First, I'll review the context given. The main points are about Warsaw being the capital of Poland, its location on the Vistula River, population, historical significance, major landmarks, and some facts about people born or died there, along with weather data and other statistics.

Looking at the facts provided, there are a lot of names of people associated with Warsaw, both born and died there, as well as some events and organizations based in the city. Also, there are weather records and specific locations like the Warsaw Metro, airports, and landmarks like the Old Town and Royal Castle.

I need to make sure the questions are varied and not repetitive. Let me brainstorm possible questions. For example, the capital of Poland, the river it's on, population, historical events, major landmarks, notable people, weather data, and organizations based there. Also, the fact that Frontex is headquartered in Warsaw could be a question.

Let me check for existing examples in the user's sample. They had questions about the largest city, river, distance to the sea, population, etc. So I should avoid repeating those. Instead, focus on the specific details from the context and facts provided.

Now, I need to ensure each answer is directly inferable from the context. For example, the answer to "What is the capital of Poland?" is Warsaw. Another could be about the largest city in the EU, which the context mentions Warsaw is the 6th most populous in the EU. Wait, the context says "Warsaw is the 6th most-populous city in the European Union." So the answer would be "6th most-populous city in the EU."

Wait, but the user's example had a question about the largest city, but in the context, it's mentioned that Warsaw is the 6th. So maybe that's a different question. Let me make sure each answer is accurate based on the context.

Also, some of the facts mention people born or died in Warsaw. For example, "Zbigniew Messner morreu em Warsaw" – so a question could be "Who died in Warsaw?" with the answer "Zbigniew Messner." But the user's example had questions about specific people, so maybe that's acceptable.

Another fact is about the Warsaw Metro being part of the public transport. A question could be "What is Warsaw's major public transport system?" with answer "Warsaw Metro."

Also, the context mentions the Warsaw Stock Exchange is the largest in Central and Eastern Europe. So a question could be "Which stock exchange is the largest in Central and Eastern Europe?" with answer "Warsaw Stock Exchange."

The context also mentions that Warsaw is an Alpha global city, so a question could be "What is Warsaw classified as globally?" with answer "Alpha global city."

Another point is the reconstructed Old Town being a World Heritage Site. So a question like "Which area in Warsaw is a World Heritage Site?" with answer "Reconstructed Old Town."

Looking at the weather data, Warsaw has a temperature minimum in February of -3.3°C. So a question could be "What is Warsaw's minimum temperature in February (°C)?" with answer "-3.3."

Also, the context mentions that Warsaw has the tallest building in the EU, Varso Place. So a question like "Which building is the tallest in the EU?" with answer "Varso Place."

I need to make sure the answers are concise and within the word limit. Let me check each possible question and answer for accuracy and brevity.

Now, compiling all these into 10 unique questions and answers, ensuring they are in Portuguese and formatted correctly with semicolons. Let me list them out and verify each one.
