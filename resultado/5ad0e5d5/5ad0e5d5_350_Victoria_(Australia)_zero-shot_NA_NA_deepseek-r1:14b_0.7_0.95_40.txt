Okay, I need to generate 10 question-response pairs in Portuguese about Victoria based on the provided context. Let me start by reading through the context carefully.

First, I should identify key points that can be turned into questions. The context mentions that Victoria is a state in southeastern Australia, so a good question could be asking for its location. Another point is its size, both in land area and population. There's also information about neighboring states and territories.

I remember that Victoria was established as a separate colony and achieved responsible government in 1855. That makes a good historical question. The gold rush in the 1850s-60s affected the population and wealth, so that could be another question.

Melbourne is the capital and the largest city, with over three-quarters of the population living there. This fact can form a question about population distribution. The state has several seats in both houses of the Australian Parliament—38 in the House of Representatives and 12 in the Senate. That’s another point for a question.

Politically, the Labor Party leads Victoria since 2014, with Daniel Andrews as premier. This is relevant for a government-related question. The economy is diverse, mainly service-oriented, which can be another question. Lastly, Melbourne's cultural institutions like museums and its status as a sports capital are interesting points.

I should make sure each question has a concise answer, up to 10 words. I'll structure them in Portuguese, using the appropriate terminology. Let me list these points and form questions around each to cover different aspects of Victoria.
