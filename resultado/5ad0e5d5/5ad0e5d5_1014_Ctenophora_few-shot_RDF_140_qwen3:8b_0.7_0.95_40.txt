Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the provided context about Ctenophora. Let me start by understanding the context thoroughly.

The context mentions that Ctenophora are marine invertebrates, commonly known as comb jellies. They use cilia called "combs" for swimming, can grow up to 1.5 meters, and there are around 100-150 validated species. They have various body forms like cydippids with tentacles and colloblasts for capturing prey. Some are predators, while a few juvenile species are parasites. Fossils date back to the Cambrian period, and there's debate about their evolutionary position relative to sponges and other animals.

Now, I need to create varied questions. Let me list possible topics: common names, swimming mechanism, size, classification, body structures, diet, fossil records, evolutionary hypotheses, examples of species, and their taxonomic status.

For each question, I need a concise answer. Let me check the facts provided. The facts mention the name origin from Greek, the phylum classification, examples like cydippids and beroids, and the taxonomic disputes. Also, the few-shot examples include species like Callianira hexagona, Coelenterata, etc.

Avoid repeating questions. Let me ensure each question is unique. For example, one about common names, another about the origin of the name, another about size, another about body structures, etc. Also, include questions about their diet, predators, and evolutionary debates.

Now, I'll structure each line in the CSV format with "pergunta;resposta". Let me verify that answers are directly from the context. For instance, the size range is mentioned as up to 1.5 meters. The name comes from Greek "kteis" (comb) and "pherō" (to carry). The main body structures are the jelly-like mass with two-cell layers. Fossil records go back to the Cambrian. The evolutionary hypotheses include the Porifera Sister Hypothesis and Ctenophora Sister Hypothesis. The examples of species are cydippids, platyctenids, and beroids. The taxonomic status is a matter of dispute. Also, mention the colloblasts for capturing prey and the fact that some are parasites.

I need to ensure each answer is under 10 words. Let me check each one. For example, "O que é um ctenophora?;filo de animais que vivem em águas marinhas" is correct. Similarly, "O que o ctenophora usa para nadar?;'pentes' - grupos de cílios" matches the context.

Now, compile all 10 questions and answers, ensuring no repetition and correct formatting. Make sure the separator is a semicolon and the language is Portuguese. Let me double-check each entry against the context to ensure accuracy.
