Now; I need to create questions that cover these topics without repeating. Each question should have a unique answer derived from the context or facts. Let me brainstorm possible questions:
But I need to ensure no repetition. The user's example had a question about the largest prime as of January 2016; but the context here is December 2018. So that's a good point to include.
Let me check for any possible repetition or missing points. I think the list above covers the main points. Now; I'll format them accordingly.
