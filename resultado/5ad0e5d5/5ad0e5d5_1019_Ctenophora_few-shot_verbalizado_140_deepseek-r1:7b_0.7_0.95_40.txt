Okay, so I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs based on the provided context about ctenophoras. Let me start by reading through the context carefully.

The context explains that ctenophoras are comb jellies, a type of marine invertebrate. They use comb-like structures for swimming and come in various sizes, from tiny to 1.5 meters. The information also mentions their appearance with tentacles, internal jelly structure, and their role as predators or parasites. There's a lot about their classification within the animal phylum and some details on their fossil records.

Now, I need to create questions that are varied and cover different aspects of ctenophoras. Each question should relate directly to the context and have a single correct answer based on it. Also, I must ensure no repeated questions and all answers are concise (up to 10 words).

Let me think about what information is there:

1. What is the scientific name for ctenophoras? (Answer: Ctenophora)
2. The primary habitat of ctenophoras. (Answer: Sea waters)
3. They use comb-like structures for which purpose. (Answer: Swimming)
4. Size range of adult ctenophores. (Answer: 1,5 m (4 pés 11 pol))
5. Common name for ctenophora. (Answer: Geleias de pente)
6. The phylum they belong to. (Answer: Ctenophore)
7. Groups used for movement. (Answer: Comb jellies)
8. Their body structure. (Answer: Mass of jelly with layers)
9. Example species name. (Answer: Mnemiopsis leidyi)
10. Year they were first described. (Answer: 1829)

I should make sure each pair is distinct and covers different aspects—name, function, habitat, size, common names, classification, etc.

Wait, the example provided by the user includes several of these points. Maybe I can structure my questions similarly but ensure they are unique.

Let me double-check if all answers fit within 10 words:

- Ctenophora
- Sea waters
- Swimming
- 1,5 m (4 pés 11 pol)
- Geleias de pente
- Ctenophore
- Comb jellies
- Mass of jelly with layers on the outside and another lining the internal cavity
- Mnemiopsis leidyi
- 1829

Yes, these all seem to fit.

I need to format them into a CSV with the separator as semicolon. Each line should have Question;Answer.

Let me make sure there are exactly 10 pairs without any repetition.

Alright, I think this meets all the requirements.
