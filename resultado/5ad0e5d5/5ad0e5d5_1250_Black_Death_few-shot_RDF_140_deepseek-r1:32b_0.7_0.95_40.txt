Okay, so I need to help generate a quiz based on the information provided about the Black Death. Let me start by understanding what's given and what needs to be done.

First, there's an abstract that explains the origins, spread, impact, and aftermath of the Black Death. Then, there are some RDF triples which provide structured data about the topic. The example format shows how the questions and answers should look in CSV with semicolon separators.

My task is to create 10 varied and comprehensive question-answer pairs in Portuguese. Each question must be directly related to the context provided, and the answers should be concise, up to 10 words. I also need to avoid repeating similar questions and ensure that each answer is either explicitly stated or can be inferred from the given information.

Let me go through the abstract again to identify key points:

- The Black Death was a bubonic plague pandemic from 1346 to 1353.
- It's the most fatal pandemic in human history, causing up to 200 million deaths.
- Affected Western Eurasia and North Africa.
- Originated either in Central or East Asia.
- Spread via fleas on black rats on Genoese ships from Crimea.
- The plague was mainly transmitted person-to-person as pneumonic plague once ashore in Europe.
- It had significant social, economic, and religious impacts.
- European population took until 1500 to recover.
- Recent evidence suggests it might have originated in Kyrgyzstan.

Now, looking at the triples, I can get more specific details:

- The disease is bubonic plague (Yersinia pestis).
- Images related to fleas and rats are mentioned.
- There's a mention of scholars like Ole Jørgen Benedictow and Sharon N. DeWitte who have studied it.

With this information, I can start formulating questions that cover different aspects: causes, spread, impact, origins, recovery time, etc.

I should make sure each question is unique and covers various facets without overlapping too much. Let me brainstorm some possible questions:

1. What was the main cause of the Black Death?
2. How did the plague spread from Crimea to Europe?
3. What percentage of the European population died?
4. When did the world population recover from this pandemic?
5. How long did the Black Death last?
6. Where is it believed the Black Death originated initially?
7. What kind of impact did the Black Death have on society?
8. Who were some scholars that studied the Black Death?
9. How was the plague primarily transmitted once it reached Europe?
10. Which countries were most affected by the pandemic?

Now, I need to ensure these questions can be answered accurately based on the context and are phrased correctly in Portuguese.

Let me check each point:

- The main cause is Yersinia pestis spread by fleas.
- Spread via ships carrying rats with fleas.
- Up to 60% in some areas, but overall around 30-50%, but specific numbers vary. Wait, the abstract mentions up to 200 million deaths, which is a high number relative to the population at the time. Maybe better to phrase it as a percentage.
- The population recovered by 1500.
- Lasted about 8 years (from 1346 to 1353).
- Originated in Central or East Asia; recent evidence points to Kyrgyzstan.
- Impacted socially, economically, and religiously.
- Scholars named include Ole Jørgen Benedictow and Sharon N. DeWitte.
- Transmitted person-to-person as pneumonic plague.
- Affected Eurasia and North Africa.

Wait, the initial spread from Asia was via land routes to Crimea, then ships brought it to Europe. So the main transmission once in Europe was person-to-person.

I think that covers all the questions. Now I need to translate them into Portuguese correctly, ensuring that each answer is accurate and concise.
