Okay, the user wants me to generate 10 question-answer pairs in Portuguese based on the given context about the 1973 oil crisis. Let me start by understanding the context thoroughly.

First, the context mentions the OAPEC, led by Saudi Arabia, imposing an oil embargo in October 1973. The embargo targeted countries that supported Israel during the Yom Kippur War, including Canada, Japan, the Netherlands, UK, and US, later expanding to others. The oil price skyrocketed from $3 to $12 per barrel, leading to a global crisis known as the "first oil shock," followed by the 1979 crisis as the "second oil shock."

Now, I need to create 10 questions in Portuguese. Each question should be relevant and the answer concise, under 10 words. Let's brainstorm possible questions:

1. Who led the OAPEC during the 1973 oil crisis? (Answer: Saudi Arabia)
2. Which countries were initially targeted? (Answer: Canada, Japan, Netherlands, UK, USA)
3. What was the result of the embargo? (Answer: Oil price increase)
4. How much did the oil price rise? (Answer: 300%)
5. What was the first oil crisis called? (Answer: First oil shock)
6. When did the embargo end? (Answer: March 1974)
7. What was the initial price of oil? (Answer: $3 per barrel)
8. Which war led to the embargo? (Answer: Yom Kippur War)
9. What were the effects of the crisis? (Answer: Political and economic impacts)
10. What followed the first oil shock? (Answer: Second oil shock in 1979)

Wait, need to check if the answers are under 10 words. For example, "Oil price increase" is two words. "Political and economic impacts" is three. That's okay. Also, make sure the questions are in Portuguese. Let me translate each question and answer accordingly.

Check for any possible errors. For example, the answer to the first question is "Saudi Arabia," which is correct. The initial countries targeted are correctly listed. The price increase is 300%, which matches the context. The first oil shock is mentioned as "primeiro choque do petróleo." The embargo ended in March 1974. The initial price was $3 per barrel. The Yom Kippur War is the correct conflict. The effects include political and economic impacts. The second oil shock followed in 1979.

Now, format each pair as "pergunta;resposta" without any markdown. Ensure there are exactly 10 pairs. Avoid any extra text. Let me verify each pair again for accuracy and conciseness.
