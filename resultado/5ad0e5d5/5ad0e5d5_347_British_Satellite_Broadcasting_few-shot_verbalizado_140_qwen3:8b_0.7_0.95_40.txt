Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the provided context and facts about British Satellite Broadcasting (BSB). Let me start by understanding the context and the facts given.

The context mentions that BSB was a TV company based in London, started broadcasting on March 25, 1990, and merged with Sky Television plc on November 2, 1990, forming BSkyB. The facts include various categories, dates, locations, and other details like ownership of TV channels, company types, and templates used in Wikipedia.

First, I should identify key information from the context and facts. The main points are:
- Founded in 1986
- Started broadcasting in 1990
- Merged with Sky Television to form BSkyB
- Located in London, UK
- Owned several TV channels like The Movie Channel, The Power Station, Galaxy, etc.
- Categories related to mass media, 1980s/1990s, UK, etc.
- Company types and Wikipedia templates used.

Now, I need to create 10 varied questions. Let me brainstorm possible questions:

1. When was BSB founded?
2. What was the merger date with Sky Television?
3. Which TV channels did BSB own?
4. Where was BSB headquartered?
5. What year did BSB start broadcasting?
6. What was the result of the merger?
7. Which categories does BSB fall under?
8. What is BSB's company type?
9. What is the name of BSB's merged company?
10. What is the significance of 1990 for BSB?

Wait, I need to ensure each question is unique and based on the facts. Let me check the facts again for more details. For example, the facts mention "British Satellite Broadcasting foi fundado em 1986-12-11" which is the founding date. Also, the merger date is 2 November 1990. The merged company is British Sky Broadcasting (BSkyB). The TV channels owned include The Movie Channel, The Power Station, Galaxy, etc. The location is London, UK. The categories include 1980s in the UK, 1990s in the UK, mass media companies, etc. The company types are various, like Company, Organization, etc.

I should avoid repeating the same type of questions. For example, one question about the merger date, another about the merged company, another about the founding date, etc. Also, include some about the TV channels and categories. Let me structure the 10 questions accordingly, ensuring each has a unique angle and the answer is directly from the facts. Let me make sure the answers are concise, up to 10 words. Also, check for any repeated questions or answers. Once I have the pairs, format them as CSV with semicolons.
