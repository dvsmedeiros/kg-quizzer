Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the provided context about the Huguenots. Let me start by understanding the context thoroughly. The text talks about the Huguenots being French Protestants, their origins, the term's possible derivation from a Swiss leader, their population size, the French Wars of Religion, the Edict of Nantes, and their eventual persecution leading to their decline.

First, I should identify key facts and events. The term "Huguenot" comes from a Swiss leader, Bezanson Hugues. The population was around 10% before the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre. The wars lasted from 1562 to 1598. The Edict of Nantes granted them autonomy. They were concentrated in southern and western France. The Edict of Fontainebleau in 1685 revoked their rights. The dragonnades were used to force conversions. The exodus affected France's society, and persecution continued under Louis XV. The Edict of Versailles in 1787 ended official persecution.

Now, I need to form questions that are varied and cover different aspects. Avoid repetition. Let's see:

1. Origin of the term "Huguenot" – related to a Swiss leader.
2. Population percentage in 1572 – 10%.
3. Duration of the French Wars of Religion – 1562-1598.
4. Treaty ending the wars – Edict of Nantes.
5. What the Edict of Nantes granted – religious, political, military autonomy.
6. Where were Huguenots concentrated – southern and western France.
7. Result of the 1620s rebellions – loss of political/military privileges.
8. Edict that revoked Protestant rights – Edict of Fontainebleau (1685).
9. Persecution under Louis XIV – dragonnades.
10. When persecution officially ended – Edict of Versailles (1787).

Check for variety and uniqueness. Each question should have a concise answer. Ensure answers are directly from the context. Now, format them as CSV with semicolons. Avoid any markdown. Make sure each line is a question and answer pair. Let me verify each answer is accurate based on the context provided.
