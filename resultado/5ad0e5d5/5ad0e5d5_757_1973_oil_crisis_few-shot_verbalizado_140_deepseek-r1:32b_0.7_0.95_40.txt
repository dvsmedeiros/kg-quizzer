Okay, so I need to generate a CSV with 10 question-answer pairs based on the given context about the 1973 oil crisis. Let me start by understanding what's provided.

The context explains that the oil crisis began in October 1973 when OAPEC members, led by Saudi Arabia, imposed an embargo on countries supporting Israel during the Yom Kippur War. The embargo targeted several nations and lasted until March 1974, causing oil prices to rise significantly. There are also some facts listed about categories and models related to the crisis.

Now, I need to create varied questions that cover different aspects of this event. Each question should have a clear, short answer based on the context or inferred from it. Let me brainstorm some key points:

1. When did the oil crisis start?
2. What was the purpose of the embargo?
3. Which countries were targeted initially?
4. How much did oil prices increase?
5. What were the long-term effects?
6. Why did European nations and Japan distance themselves from the U.S.?
7. Who led OAPEC during the embargo?
8. When did the embargo end?
9. What was another name for this crisis?
10. How did Henry Kissinger negotiate with non-cooperative countries?

Wait, some of these might overlap or not be directly covered. Let me check each against the context.

The context mentions the start in October 1973, the embargo targeting specific nations, price increase from $3 to nearly $12 per barrel, and it being called the first oil shock. It also talks about Henry Kissinger's role but doesn't specify exact dates for his negotiations. However, I can infer that he was involved in diplomatic efforts.

I should ensure each question is unique and has a concise answer. Let me structure them accordingly.
