Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user provided a bunch of RDF data and wants me to generate a CSV file based on the given instructions and rules. Let me start by understanding the data and the requirements.

First, the data seems to be in Turtle format, which is a syntax for expressing RDF triples. The main subject here is the Scottish Parliament, and there are various predicates and objects associated with it. The user wants a CSV that lists all the properties of the Scottish Parliament, specifically the predicate (property name) and the object (value), each in separate columns. Additionally, there are rules to follow, like removing duplicate lines, handling collections, and using specific separators.

Looking at the example provided, it's clear that the CSV should have two columns: "Property" and "Value". Each row corresponds to a predicate-object pair. However, I need to process the data according to the rules. For instance, if a predicate has multiple objects (like a list), I should split them into separate rows. Also, if there are URIs, I should extract the local name (the part after the last slash or #) and use that as the value. For example, the URI <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alison_Johnstone> should become "Alison_Johnstone".

Let me go through the data step by step. The main subject is <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scottish_Parliament>. The triples include various predicates like ns2:committeeInLegislature, ns2:lastElectionDate, ns2:leader, etc. Each of these has one or more objects. 

For example, the predicate ns2:committeeInLegislature has a list of URIs as objects. Each of these should be split into individual rows with the local name of the URI as the value. Similarly, ns1:committees has a list of strings, which can be directly used as values. 

I need to make sure that each predicate-object pair is on a separate line. If a predicate has multiple objects (like a list), each object becomes a separate row. Also, if a predicate has a value that's a URI, I should extract the local name. If the value is a literal, like a date or a string, I should use that directly.

Let me check for any duplicates. For example, the predicate ns1:leader appears twice with different objects: <http://dbpedia.org/resource/George_Adam> and <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alison_Johnstone>? Wait, no, looking at the data, the first occurrence is ns2:leader <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alison_Johnstone>, and then ns1:leader <http://dbpedia.org/resource/George_Adam>. So these are two different predicates (ns2:leader vs ns1:leader) with different values, so they should be separate entries. That's important to note.

Also, some predicates have multiple types, like ns1:leader1Type which has two values. These should be split into separate rows as well.

Now, handling the namespaces. The user mentioned that the first part of the URI (before the last /) should be the property name, and the last part (after the last / or #) should be the value. So for a predicate like <http://dbpedia.org/property/backgroundColor>, the property name would be "backgroundColor" and the value would be "#500791".

Let me start compiling the data. For each triple in the subject <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scottish_Parliament>, I'll extract the predicate and object. Then, process each object according to the rules.

For example, the triple:
<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scottish_Parliament> ns2:committeeInLegislature <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Audit> .

This would become:
Property,Value
ns2:committeeInLegislature,Audit

Another example:
<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scottish_Parliament> ns1:committees "Europe and External Relations" .

Which becomes:
Property,Value
ns1:committees,Europe and External Relations

Now, looking at the data, there are several instances where a predicate has a list of objects. For example, the ns2:committeeInLegislature has multiple URIs. Each of these should be a separate row. The same applies to ns1:committees, which has a list of strings separated by commas. Each of these should be split into individual rows.

Also, the predicate ns1:politicalGroups has a string that includes a line break. According to the rules, line breaks should be replaced with a space. So the value "Government", """Opposition 



Other""" should be processed to "Government", "Opposition Other".

Another thing to note is the use of namespaces. The user wants the property names to include the namespace prefix (like ns1, ns2, etc.), but the actual URI might be long. However, the example shows that the user is using the predicate as is, including the namespace. For example, in the sample data, the first line is <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scottish_Parliament> ns2:committeeInLegislature <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Audit> . So the property would be "ns2:committeeInLegislature" and the value would be "Audit".

Wait, but the example in the user's message shows that for the first line, the property is "ns2:committeeInLegislature" and the value is "Audit". So I need to keep the namespace prefixes (ns1, ns2, etc.) as part of the property name. That's important.

Now, let me go through all the triples and list them out.

Starting with the ns2:committeeInLegislature. There are seven URIs under this predicate. Each of these becomes a separate row with the property "ns2:committeeInLegislature" and the value being the local name of the URI.

Then, ns2:lastElectionDate has a literal value "2021-05-06", so that's a direct entry.

ns2:leader has the URI <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alison_Johnstone>, so the value is "Alison_Johnstone".

ns2:location is <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scotland>, so the value is "Scotland".

ns2:politicalPartyInLegislature is <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Third_Sturgeon_government>, value "Third_Sturgeon_government".

ns1:backgroundColor has the value "#500791".

ns1:committees has a list of seven items separated by commas. Each of these is split into individual rows.

ns1:commons is "yes", so that's a direct entry.

ns1:commonsSearch is "Scottish Parliament".

ns1:d is "yes".

ns1:lastElection is "2021-05-06".

ns1:leader is <http://dbpedia.org/resource/George_Adam>, value "George_Adam".

ns1:leader1Type has two values: <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Presiding_Officer_of_the_Scottish_Parliament> and an empty string. The empty string should be ignored. So the value is "Presiding_Officer_of_the_Scottish_Parliament".

ns1:leader2Type is <http://dbpedia.org/resource/First_Minister_of_Scotland>, value "First_Minister_of_Scotland".

ns1:leader4Type is <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Opposition_Parties_of_the_Scottish_Parliament>, value "Opposition_Parties_of_the_Scottish_Parliament".

ns1:legislature is "6".

ns1:meetingPlace has two values: <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scottish_Parliament_Building> and "Edinburgh, Scotland". The first is a URI, so the value is "Scottish_Parliament_Building". The second is a string, so "Edinburgh, Scotland".

ns1:nextElection is "--05-07".

ns1:party is <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scottish_National_Party>, value "Scottish_National_Party".

ns1:politicalGroups has two values: "Government" and """Opposition 



Other""" (with line breaks). The line breaks should be replaced with spaces, so the second value becomes "Opposition Other".

ns1:portal is "Scotland".

ns1:structure is "Scottish-parliament.svg".

ns1:structure1Alt is "Scottish Parliament composition".

ns1:structure1Res is "250".

ns1:wikiPageUsesTemplate has multiple URIs. Each of these should be split into individual rows, extracting the local name.

dcterms:subject has multiple URIs. Each becomes a separate row.

ns3:sameAs has a URI, so the value is "152958644".

foaf:depiction has multiple URIs. Each becomes a separate row.

Now, I need to list all these properties and values, ensuring that each predicate-object pair is a separate row, handling lists by splitting them, and processing URIs correctly.

I should also check for any duplicates. For example, if a predicate appears multiple times with the same value, but the user's instruction says to remove duplicates. However, in the given data, each predicate seems to be unique except for ns1:leader1Type which has an empty string. That should be ignored.

Finally, arrange all these in the CSV format with "Property" and "Value" columns, ensuring proper separators and no trailing spaces.
