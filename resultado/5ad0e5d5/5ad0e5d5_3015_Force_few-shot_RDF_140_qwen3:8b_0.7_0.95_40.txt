Okay, let's see. The user wants me to generate a CSV based on the provided data and the given instructions. First, I need to parse the data correctly. The data seems to be in RDF format, with various statements about the "Force" concept. 

Looking at the instructions, the CSV should have three columns: "Subject", "Property", and "Object". Each row represents a triple from the RDF data. The user also mentioned that if the object is a URI, I should use the last part after the last slash. For example, if the object is "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Force", the last part is "Force".

I need to go through each line of the data and extract the subject, property, and object. Let's start with the first line:

"Você" is the subject, "Você" is the property, and "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Force" is the object. Wait, no, looking at the actual data, the first line after the initial text is:

"Você" is the subject? Wait, no. The data provided starts with:

```
<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Force> a <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#Class> .
```

Wait, maybe I should recheck. The actual data starts with:

```
<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Force> a <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#Class> .
```

So the subject is <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Force>, the property is a (rdf:type), and the object is <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#Class>.

But the user's example includes lines like:

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Force> ns2:unit <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Newton_(unit)> 

So the subject is the resource, the property is ns2:unit, and the object is the Newton unit.

So I need to process each line, split into subject, property, object. Then, for each object, if it's a URI, take the last part after the last slash. For example, "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Newton_(unit)" becomes "Newton_(unit)".

Also, the user mentioned that if the object is a URI, use the last part. If it's a literal, keep it as is. For example, in the line:

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Force> ns2:wikiPageUsesTemplate <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Template:Classical_mechanics> 

The object is a URI, so the last part is "Template:Classical_mechanics".

So I need to process all these triples, extract the subject, property, and object, and then format them into the CSV.

Let me check if there are any lines that are not triples. The data seems to be a series of triples, each on a separate line. Each line has the subject, property, and object separated by spaces and dots.

So, for each line, split into three parts: subject, property, object. Then process the object.

Now, let's start creating the CSV:

First row:
Subject: <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Force>
Property: a
Object: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#Class>
But the object is a URI, so we take the last part: "Class"

Wait, but the user said to take the last part after the last slash. So for the URI "http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#Class", the last part after the last slash is "Class".

So the first row would be:

"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Force","a","Class"

But wait, the subject is "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Force", the property is "a", and the object is "Class".

Wait, but the user might want the subject as the resource, and the object as the last part of the URI. So that's correct.

Another example:

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Force> ns2:unit <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Newton_(unit)> 

The object is "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Newton_(unit)", so the last part is "Newton_(unit)".

So the row would be:

"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Force","ns2:unit","Newton_(unit)"

Another line:

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Force> ns2:wikiPageUsesTemplate <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Template:Classical_mechanics>

Object is "Template:Classical_mechanics".

Another line:

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Force> foaf:depiction <http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Galileo.arp.300pix.jpg>

Object is "Galileo.arp.300pix.jpg".

So the CSV would have these entries.

Now, I need to make sure that all lines are processed this way. Also, check if any objects are literals (like dates, numbers, etc.) and leave them as is. For example, if there's a line like:

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Force> ns2:wikiPageModified "2020-01-01" .

Then the object is "2020-01-01", which is a literal, so we leave it as is.

But in the provided data, the examples seem to have URIs as objects. Let me check the data again.

Looking at the data:

The first line is:

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Force> a <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#Class> .

Then:

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Force> ns2:quantity <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Force> .

Wait, that seems odd. Wait, maybe I need to check all the lines.

Another line:

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Force> ns2:unit <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Newton_(unit)> .

So the object is "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Newton_(unit)".

Another line:

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Force> ns2:wikiPageUsesTemplate <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Template:Classical_mechanics>, etc.

So all objects are URIs except for the last line which is the foaf:depiction with two URIs. Wait, the line:

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Force> foaf:depiction <http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Galileo.arp.300pix.jpg>,
        <http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Torque_animation.gif> .

Wait, that line has two objects? Or is it a single line with multiple objects? The original data seems to have each triple on a line. Let me check the exact data provided.

The user provided the data as:

```
<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Force> a <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#Class> .
<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Force> ns2:quantity <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Force> .
<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Force> ns2:unit <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Newton_(unit)> .
<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Force> ns2:wikiPageUsesTemplate <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Template:Classical_mechanics>,
        <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Template:Good_article>,
        <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Template:Harvid>,
        <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Template:Redirect>,
        <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Template:Refend> ;
    foaf:depiction <http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Galileo.arp.300pix.jpg>,
        <http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Torque_animation.gif> .
```

Wait, that line seems to have multiple objects separated by commas and semicolons. But in RDF, each triple is a separate statement. However, the data provided might have multiple triples in a single line. For example, the line with foaf:depiction has two objects. But in the original data, the line is:

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Force> ns2:wikiPageUsesTemplate <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Template:Classical_mechanics>, etc. ; foaf:depiction ... 

This might be a single line with multiple statements. But in the user's data, the lines are separated, so each line is a separate triple. However, the way the data is presented here might have multiple triples in a line. For example, the line:

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Force> ns2:wikiPageUsesTemplate <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Template:Classical_mechanics>, etc.

But this seems like a single line with multiple objects. However, in RDF, each triple is a separate statement. So perhaps the user's data has some formatting issues, but the main point is to extract each triple.

In the original data, the last line is:

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Force> foaf:depiction <http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Galileo.arp.300pix.jpg>,
        <http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Torque_animation.gif> .

But in this case, the line has two objects for the foaf:depiction property. But how is that represented? In RDF, a property can have multiple values. So this line would be two separate triples:

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Force> foaf:depiction <http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Galileo.arp.300pix.jpg> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Force> foaf:depiction <http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Torque_animation.gif> .

So for the purpose of the CSV, each of these would be separate rows.

But in the user's data, these are presented in a single line, so I need to split them into separate lines.

Therefore, the approach is to process each line, split into subject, property, and object, handling cases where there are multiple objects in a single line.

But this might complicate things. Alternatively, the user might have intended that each line is a separate triple, so the data is already properly formatted.

Assuming that each line is a single triple, then processing each line accordingly.

So, the first line is:

Subject: <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Force>
Property: a
Object: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#Class>

Which becomes:

"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Force","a","Class"

Second line:

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Force> ns2:quantity <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Force> .

Object is "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Force", so the last part is "Force".

Third line:

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Force> ns2:unit <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Newton_(unit)> .

Object becomes "Newton_(unit)".

Fourth line:

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Force> ns2:wikiPageUsesTemplate <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Template:Classical_mechanics>, etc.

Wait, the line seems to have multiple objects. So in this case, the line is:

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Force> ns2:wikiPageUsesTemplate <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Template:Classical_mechanics>, etc. ;

But the actual data might have multiple objects in the same line, which would require splitting.

But given the original data, perhaps the user intended that each line is a separate triple. However, in the provided data, the line with foaf:depiction has two objects. So, I need to split that into two lines.

But since the user provided the data as a single block, perhaps the correct approach is to process each line as a triple, even if some lines have multiple objects. For example, the line:

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Force> ns2:wikiPageUsesTemplate <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Template:Classical_mechanics>, <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Template:Good_article>, <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Template:Harvid>, <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Template:Redirect>, <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Template:Refend> ;

This line has multiple objects for the ns2:wikiPageUsesTemplate property. So this line would represent multiple triples:

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Force> ns2:wikiPageUsesTemplate <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Template:Classical_mechanics> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Force> ns2:wikiPageUsesTemplate <http://db, etc.

So, for each of these, split into separate lines.

Similarly, the line with foaf:depiction has two objects, so split into two lines.

Therefore, the final CSV would have multiple rows for each triple.

But given the complexity, perhaps the user's data is structured with each line as a single triple, and the line with multiple objects is a single line that needs to be split into multiple lines.

However, without seeing the exact formatting, it's challenging. But based on the data provided, I'll proceed under the assumption that each line represents a single triple, and any line with multiple objects is a single line that needs to be split into multiple rows.

But since the user provided the data as a block, perhaps the correct approach is to process each line as a separate triple, even if some lines have multiple objects. For example, the line with foaf:depiction has two objects, so split into two lines.

In that case, the CSV would have multiple entries for the same subject and property.

Now, putting this all together, I'll create the CSV with the three columns, ensuring that each object is processed as per the instructions.

```csv
Subject,Property,Object
"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Force","a","Class"
"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Force","ns2:quantity","Force"
"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Force","ns2:unit","Newton_(unit)"
"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Force","ns2:wikiPageUsesTemplate","Template:Classical_mechanics"
"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Force","ns2:wikiPageUsesTemplate","Template:Good_article"
"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Force","ns2:wikiPageUsesTemplate","Template:Harvid"
"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Force","ns2:wikiPageUsesTemplate","Template:Redirect"
"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Force","ns2:wikiPageUsesTemplate","Template:Refend"
"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Force","foaf:depiction","Galileo.arp.300pix.jpg"
"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Force","foaf:depiction","Torque_animation.gif"
```

### Explicação:
1. **Cabeçalho do CSV**: As colunas são `Subject`, `Property`, e `Object`.
2. **Processamento de URIs**: Para objetos que são URIs (ex: `http://dbpedia.org/resource/Force`), o último segmento após o último `/` é usado (ex: `Force`, `Newton_(unit)`).
3. **Linha com múltiplos objetos**: A linha que contém múltiplos objetos para `ns2:wikiPageUsesTemplate` e `foaf:depiction` foi dividida em linhas separadas, mantendo a correspondência entre sujeito, propriedade e objeto.
4. **Literais**: Não houve literais no dado fornecido, então todos os objetos são URIs.
