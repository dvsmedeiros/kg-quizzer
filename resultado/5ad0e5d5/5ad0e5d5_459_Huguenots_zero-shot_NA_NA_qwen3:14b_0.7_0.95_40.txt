Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs based on the given context about the Huguenots. Let me start by reading through the context carefully to identify key points.

First, the Huguenots were French Protestants following the Reformed or Calvinist tradition. The term might come from a Swiss leader named Bezanson Hugues. They were used by the mid-16th century. Eastern France's Protestants were mainly Lutherans. The Huguenot population was around 10% in 1572, declining to 7-8% by 1600. Louis XIV's dragonnades and the Edict of Fontainebleau in 1685 persecuted them, leading to exodus. The Edict of Nantes gave them autonomy, but later they lost political and military privileges. Jeanne d'Albret and Henry IV were leaders. The French Wars of Religion lasted from 1562 to 1598. The exodus caused a brain drain. Louis XV continued persecution until Louis XVI's Edict of Versailles in 1787.

Now, I need to form questions that cover these points. Each question should be relevant and concise, with answers under 10 words. Let's list possible questions:

1. What was the religious tradition of the Huguenots? Answer: Reformed (Calvinist) tradition.
2. Where did the term "Huguenot" originate? Answer: Name of Swiss leader Hugues.
3. What percentage of the French population were Huguenots in 1572? Answer: Up to 10%.
4. What was the Edict of Nantes? Answer: Granted autonomy to Huguenots.
5. Who were the leaders of the Huguenots? Answer: Jeanne d'Albret and Henry IV.
6. What caused the decline of Huguenots in the 17th century? Answer: Dragonnades and Edict of Fontainebleau.
7. What were the French Wars of Religion? Answer: Religious conflicts from 1562 to 1598.
8. What was the effect of the Huguenot exodus? Answer: Brain drain, loss of skilled individuals.
9. When did Protestants gain equal rights in France? Answer: Edict of Versailles (1787).
10. What was the result of the Edict of Fontainebleau? Answer: Revoked Protestant rights, forced conversion or exile.

I should check that each answer is concise and within the word limit. Also, ensure that the questions are clear and directly reference the context. Avoid repetition and cover different aspects of the Huguenots' history, religion, and persecution.
