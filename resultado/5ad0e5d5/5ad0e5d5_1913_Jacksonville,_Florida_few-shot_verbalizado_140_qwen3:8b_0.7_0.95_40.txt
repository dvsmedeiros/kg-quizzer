Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the provided context and facts about Jacksonville, Florida. Let me start by reading through the context and facts carefully.

First, the context mentions that Jacksonville is the largest city by area in the contiguous U.S., the seat of Duval County, and consolidated in 1968. It also talks about the population, location on the St. Johns River, historical sites like Fort Caroline, and notable people like Andrew Jackson. The facts list various locations, people, and events tied to Jacksonville, such as sports teams, buildings, and historical figures.

I need to ensure each question is unique and covers different aspects. Let me brainstorm possible questions. For example, the population rank, the river it's on, the consolidation year, the original inhabitants, the French colony name, the city's nickname, the military presence, the temperature records, and some specific facts from the list like the area code, notable buildings, or sports teams.

Wait, the user provided a list of facts. Let me check those to avoid repetition and ensure accuracy. For instance, there's a mention of the St. Johns River's mouth being in Jacksonville, the nickname "The River City," and the military bases. Also, some people born in Jacksonville, like Carson Beck and Michael Jennings.

I should make sure each question is distinct. Let me list possible questions:

1. What is Jacksonville's rank in U.S. population? (Answer: 12th)
2. Which river flows through Jacksonville? (St. Johns River)
3. When did Jacksonville consolidate with Duval County? (1968)
4. Who were the original inhabitants? (Timucua)
5. What was the name of the French colony? (Fort Caroline)
6. What is Jacksonville's nickname? ("The River City")
7. What is the highest temperature recorded in March? (91°F)
8. Which military base is in Jacksonville? (Naval Station Mayport)
9. What is the city's area code? (Not directly stated, but maybe from facts? Wait, the facts mention the area code isn't listed. Maybe another fact. Alternatively, use the mention of WJCT (TV) or other locations.)
Wait, looking back, the facts list several locations like South Atlantic Investment Corporation Building, WBOB (AM), WJCT (TV), etc. But maybe the area code isn't explicitly mentioned. Maybe use a different fact, like the percentage of insolation in September (62%) or the precipitation in November (2 inches). Alternatively, the temperature record in June (47°F). Let me check the facts again.

Looking at the facts, there's "Jacksonville, Florida possui porcentagem de insolação em setembro 62" (September insolation percentage 62%) and "Jacksonville, Florida possui recorde de temperatura baixa em junho (°F) 47" (lowest temperature in June 47°F). Also, "Jacksonville, Florida possui recorde de temperatura alta em março (°F) 91" (highest temperature in March 91°F). So I can use the temperature records.

Another fact: "Jacksonville, Florida está no fuso horário Eastern Time Zone" (Eastern Time Zone). But that's more of a time zone fact. Maybe use the military presence: "Jacksonville's military bases and the nearby Naval Submarine Base Kings Bay form the third largest military presence in the United States." So a question could be about the military presence.

Also, the facts mention "Jacksonville, Florida usa modelo de página wiki Template:City of Jacksonville" which might not be useful. Another fact: "Jacksonville, Florida possui área aquática 329350000.0" which is 329,350,000 square meters? Maybe not a good question. Alternatively, the area code isn't mentioned, so maybe skip that.

I need 10 questions. Let me structure them:

1. What is Jacksonville's rank in U.S. population? (12th)
2. Which river flows through Jacksonville? (St. Johns River)
3. When did Jacksonville consolidate with Duval County? (1968)
4. What was the name of the French colony? (Fort Caroline)
5. What is Jacksonville's nickname? ("The River City")
6. What is the highest temperature recorded in March? (91°F)
7. What is the lowest temperature recorded in June? (47°F)
8. Which military base is located in Jacksonville? (Naval Station Mayport)
9. What is the city's time zone? (Eastern Time Zone)
10. What is the percentage of insolation in September? (62%)

Wait, but the facts also mention several sports teams and people. For example, "Carson Beck nasceu em Jacksonville, Florida" (Carson Beck was born in Jacksonville). Maybe a question about a notable person. But the user example includes questions about historical figures, so maybe include that. However, the example had 10 questions, so perhaps the user wants a mix of general facts and specific ones.

Alternatively, use the fact about the military presence. Let me check the example given in the user's instruction, which included questions like "What is the population rank?" and "What is the nickname?" So maybe follow that structure.

Another fact: "Jacksonville, Florida possui área aquática 329350000.0" which is the area of water in square meters. But that's a specific fact. Maybe include that as a question.

But to ensure diversity, let me pick the 10 questions as follows:

1. Population rank (12th)
2. River (St. Johns)
3. Consolidation year (1968)
4. Original inhabitants (Timucua)
5. French colony name (Fort Caroline)
6. Nickname ("The River City")
7. Highest March temperature (91°F)
8. Lowest June temperature (47°F)
9. Time zone (Eastern Time Zone)
10. Area of water (329,350,000 square meters)

But the user might prefer more varied questions. Let me check the facts again for other possible questions. For example, the mention of "Yellow Bluff Fort Historic State Park possui cidade mais próxima Jacksonville" (Yellow Bluff Fort has Jacksonville as the nearest city). Maybe a question about that. Or the fact that it's named after Andrew Jackson: "Jacksonville, Florida foi nomeado em homenagem a Andrew Jackson" (Named after Andrew Jackson).

So maybe include that as a question: "Who was Jacksonville named after?" (Answer: Andrew Jackson)

Alternatively, the nickname "River City" is already covered.

Let me adjust the list:

1. Population rank (12th)
2. River (St. Johns)
3. Consolidation year (1968)
4. Original inhabitants (Timucua)
5. French colony (Fort Caroline)
6. Nickname ("The River City")
7. Highest March temp (91°F)
8. Lowest June temp (43°F)
9. Named after (Andrew Jackson)
10. Time zone (Eastern Time Zone)

This gives a mix of population, geography, history, and time zone. Now, need to format these into CSV with "question,answer" and ensure the answers are correct based on the provided facts.

Let me verify each answer:

1. Context says "largest city by area in the contiguous U.S." but population rank is mentioned as 12th in the facts? Wait, the context says "largest city by area", but the population rank is 12th (from the facts: "Jacksonville, Florida possui porcentagem de insolação em setembro 62" – no, that's insolation. Wait, the initial context says "largest city by area in the contiguous U.S." but the population rank is 12th (from the example in the user's instruction: "What is the population rank?" answer 12th). So that's correct.

2. St. Johns River is mentioned in the context.

3. Consolidation in 1968 is in the context.

4. Original inhabitants: Timucua from the context.

5. French colony: Fort Caroline, as per the context.

6. Nickname: "The River City" from the facts.

7. Highest March temp: 91°F from the facts.

8. Lowest June temp: 47°F from the facts.

9. Named after Andrew Jackson from the facts.

10. Time zone: Eastern Time Zone from the facts.

Now, I need to format these into CSV, ensuring that the answers are correctly capitalized and match the facts. Also, check for any possible errors. For example, the temperature in June is 47°F, and March is 91°F. The time zone is Eastern Time Zone. The nickname is "The River City". The French colony is Fort Caroline. Original inhabitants are Timucua. Consolidation year 1968. Population rank 12th. Area of water is 329,350,000 square meters (but I didn't use that, so maybe replace one of the questions with that. Alternatively, use the nickname as the 6th question.)

I think the current list is sufficient. Now, create the CSV.
