Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs in Portuguese based on the given context about Fresno. Let me start by reading through the context and the facts provided.

First, the context mentions that Fresno is the fifth-most populous city in California, the most populous inland city, and 34th in the nation. So a question about its population ranking could work. The answer should be "34" as per the facts.

Next, the context states that Fresno was founded in 1872 as a railway station. So a question about the founding year would be "1872". Also, the facts mention "Fresno, California foi fundado em 1885-10-21" but the context says 1872. Wait, there's a conflict here. The context says founded in 1872 as a railway station, but the fact says founded in 1885. Hmm, need to check which is correct. The context is more detailed, so maybe the fact is about incorporation. The context says "before it was incorporated in 1885." So the founding as a railway station was 1872, but incorporation was 1885. So a question about incorporation year would be 1885.

The context also mentions the population in 2020 as 542,107, making it fifth in California. So a question about the fifth-largest city in California would have the answer "Fresno".

The distance from Fresno to Los Angeles is 350 km, as per the context. So a question about that distance would be "350 km".

The name "Fresno" comes from the Spanish word for ash trees, so the answer would be "freixo" (ash tree in Portuguese).

The context mentions that Fresno is the third-largest majority-Hispanic city in the US, with 50.5% Hispanic in 2020. So a question about the majority-Hispanic city could be "terceira maior cidade".

The facts list "Fresno, California possui código postal 93650..." so a question about the postal code could be "93650".

The context says the city is in the San Joaquin Valley, so a question about the valley would be "Valle do San Joaquin".

The facts mention "Fresno, California possui imagem representativa FresnoRainforest.jpg" so a question about the image could be "FresnoRainforest.jpg".

Wait, but the user wants answers in Portuguese. So "freixo" is correct. Also, check for other facts. The facts have "Fresno, California possui posição no ranking populacional 34" which aligns with the context's 34th most populous. So that's another question.

Also, the context says it's the most populous inland city in California, so a question about that would be "maior cidade interior".

I need to ensure each question is unique and covers different aspects. Let me list possible questions:

1. Ranking populacional nos EUA
2. Ano de fundação (1872)
3. Cidade mais populosa inland
4. Distância a Los Angeles
5. Significado do nome
6. Porcentagem hispânica
7. Códigos postais
8. Vale onde está localizada
9. Imagem representativa
10. Ano de incorporação (1885)

Check if answers are in the context or facts. For example, the postal code is in the facts. The image is in the facts. The majority-Hispanic is in the context. The incorporation year is in the context.

Now, structure each question in Portuguese with the correct answer. Make sure answers are concise and match the facts.
