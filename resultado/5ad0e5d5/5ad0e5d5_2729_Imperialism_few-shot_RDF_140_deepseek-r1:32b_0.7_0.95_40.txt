Okay, so I need to generate 10 pairs of question and answer in Portuguese based on the given context about imperialism. Let me start by understanding what the context says.

Imperialism is a policy or practice where a country extends its power and influence, often through territorial acquisition or controlling other areas economically and politically. It uses both hard power (military and economic) and soft power (cultural and diplomatic). Imperialism is related to colonialism and empire but is distinct because it can apply to various forms of expansion.

Now, looking at the facts provided, there are several DBpedia resources linked to imperialism. For example, some political parties like the Canadian Party and the Conservative Party of Canada had imperialism as their ideology. Also, events like genocides in Circassia and Herero were motivated by imperialism. There's also mention of books on culture and imperialism, and people who opposed or studied it.

I should create varied questions that cover different aspects: definition, examples, related concepts, historical contexts, etc. Each question needs a clear, short answer from the context.

Let me think of potential questions:

1. What is the main goal of imperialism? (From the abstract)
2. Which political party in Canada had imperialism as its ideology? (From facts)
3. Imperialism can be achieved through which two types of power? (Abstract mentions hard and soft)
4. What is another term for economic control used by imperialist countries? (Not explicitly mentioned, but related to gaining control)
5. The book "Culture and Imperialism" studies what subject? (From facts)
6. Which genocide was motivated by imperialism? (From facts)
7. What does imperialism often lead to in the colonies? (Abstract mentions extending power and dominion)
8. Who opposed imperialism? (From facts, Léon-Étienne Duval)
9. Imperialism is related to which other concept mentioned here? (Colonialism and empire from abstract)
10. Which country's expansion can be seen as an example of imperialism? (Japan, mentioned in the few-shots)

Now, I'll structure each into Portuguese questions and answers, ensuring they fit within 10 words for the answer.

I need to make sure each question is unique and covers different aspects without repetition.
