Alright, I need to help the user generate a CSV based on their provided data and instructions. Let me start by understanding what they've given.

First, there's a detailed description of pharmacy roles in Portuguese, explaining that pharmacists can be called by various names like farmacêutico, químico, etc. Then, there's a block of RDF data from DBpedia about the Pharmacy subject, including properties and various entities related to it.

The user also included an "Instrução Final" instructing me to generate a CSV according to their instructions and rules. Since they provided both Portuguese text and RDF data, I need to figure out how to structure this into a CSV format.

Looking at the RDF data, it's structured with triples: subject, predicate, object. Each entity is linked via properties like 'a', 'name', 'officialNames', etc. For example, Pharmacy is a Work, has the name "Pharmacy", and official names including "Pharmacist, Chemist, Doctor of Pharmacy, Druggist, Apothecary or simply Doctor".

I think the user wants to extract specific information from this RDF data into a CSV. Common fields might include the subject's name, its type (like Work), official names, depictions (images), and other related properties.

I should identify all unique entities in the RDF that are instances of Pharmacy-related things. For example, there's Pharmacy itself, various companies like Wegmans,.Virtual_pharmacy, etc., each with their own properties.

Each row in the CSV should represent one entity, with columns for name, type (like Work or Company), official names if available, depictions, and any other relevant details.

I'll need to parse through all the triples, identify which ones are entities related to Pharmacy, extract their labels, types, official names, and images. Then, structure this information into a CSV with appropriate headers.

I should make sure that each entity is correctly categorized, and if there are multiple entries for the same property (like depictions), I'll list them separated by commas or handle them as needed.

Finally, the CSV should be clean, well-formatted, and include all relevant data points extracted from the provided RDF.
