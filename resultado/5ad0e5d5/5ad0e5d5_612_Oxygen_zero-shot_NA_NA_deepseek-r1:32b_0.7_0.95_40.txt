Okay, I need to generate a CSV with 10 question-answer pairs based on the provided context about oxygen. Let me start by reading through the context carefully.

First, the context explains that oxygen has the symbol O and atomic number 8. That's straightforward for a question: "Qual é o símbolo químico do oxigênio?" with the answer "O."

Next, it mentions that oxygen is in the chalcogen group. So another question could be about its group.

The context also talks about how oxygen forms O2 under standard conditions, making up 20.95% of Earth's atmosphere. That's a good point for two separate questions: one about the percentage and another about the diatomic form.

It's noted that oxygen is the third most abundant element in the universe after hydrogen and helium. This can be turned into a question about its abundance.

Oxygen makes up almost half of Earth's crust as oxides, which is another fact to include.

Photosynthesis replenishes oxygen by converting water and carbon dioxide using sunlight. That gives a good question on how oxygen is produced.

Oxygen is essential in organic molecules like proteins and nucleic acids, so a question about its presence in these structures makes sense.

The discovery part mentions Michael Sendivogius before 1604, but the credit often goes to Priestley because his work was published first. However, Lavoisier named it oxygen correctly. This gives two questions: one on who isolated it and another on who coined the name.

Ozone (O3) is an allotrope that absorbs UVB radiation in the ozone layer. That's a good point for a question about its role in protecting the biosphere.

Lastly, common uses include steel production, welding, rocket propellants, etc., so a question on its applications can be added.

I need to make sure each answer is concise and fits within 10 words. Also, I should vary the questions to cover different aspects of oxygen's properties, discovery, and uses.
