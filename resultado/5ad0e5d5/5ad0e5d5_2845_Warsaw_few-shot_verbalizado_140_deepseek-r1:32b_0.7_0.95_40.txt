Okay, so I need to create a quiz with 10 questions and answers based on the information provided about Warsaw. Let me start by reading through all the context and facts carefully.

First, the abstract gives a lot of general info about Warsaw: it's the capital of Poland, located on the Vistula River, its population, economic status, etc. Then there are specific triples with various facts, like people born or died in Warsaw, organizations headquartered there, temperature data, etc.

I should make sure each question is unique and covers different aspects of the context. Let me brainstorm some topics: geography, history, economy, culture, education, sports, landmarks, transport, population stats, notable institutions.

Now, I'll go through the facts to find suitable questions:

1. **Population:** The metropolitan area has 3.1 million residents.
2. **Geography:** It's on the Vistula River.
3. **Economy:** Warsaw Stock Exchange is the largest in CEE.
4. **Transportation:** Warsaw Chopin Airport is the busiest.
5. **Education:** University of Warsaw is a notable institution.
6. **Landmarks:** Royal Castle is an architectural attraction.
7. **Sports:** Legia Warsaw is a top football club.
8. **Institutions:** Frontex is headquartered there.
9. **Demographics:** Population within the city area is 1.86 million.
10. **Climate:** Temperature in August can reach up to 38°C.

I think these cover a good range without overlapping too much. Now, I'll structure each as a question and answer pair in Portuguese, using the correct CSV format with semicolons.
