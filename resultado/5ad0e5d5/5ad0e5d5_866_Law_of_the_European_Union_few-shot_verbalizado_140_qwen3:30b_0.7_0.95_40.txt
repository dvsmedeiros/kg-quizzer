Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs in Portuguese based on the given context. Let me start by understanding the context and the facts provided.

The context is about European Union law, its history, structure, and how it's interpreted. The facts mention things like John Bell, Common Market Law Review, and some wiki templates related to the Law of the European Union.

First, I should make sure each question is relevant and has a unique answer. The answers need to be short, up to 10 words. Let me go through the facts and the abstract to find possible points.

1. The EU law's origin: The abstract mentions the 1952 founding of the European Coal and Steel Community. So a question could be about when it started.
2. The main goal of EU law: The abstract says it promotes peace, social justice, etc. So a question about the main objective.
3. The judicial branch: The Court of Justice of the European Union interprets EU law. So a question about who creates case law.
4. John Bell's areas: The facts state he works in Law of the European Union. So a question about his specialization.
5. Common Market Law Review's discipline: The facts say it's in the same discipline. So a question about its field.
6. Main topic of Law of the European Union: The fact says it's the main topic. So a question about its main subject.
7. Wiki templates: There are mentions of different templates. So a question about which template is used.
8. Henry G. Schermers: The fact says he's a subdiscipline. So a question about his relation.
9. Another template: The fact mentions another template. So a question about that.
10. The constitutional structure: The abstract says the treaties form it. So a question about what forms the structure.

Now, I need to phrase these as questions in Portuguese, ensuring answers are concise and from the context. Let me check each to avoid repetition and ensure they are varied. Also, confirm that answers are directly from the given facts or abstract.
