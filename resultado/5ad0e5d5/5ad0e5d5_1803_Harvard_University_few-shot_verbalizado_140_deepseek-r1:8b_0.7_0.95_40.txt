Ok, I need to generate 10 question;answer pairs in CSV format based on the given context and facts. Let me start by understanding what's provided.

First, the context is about Harvard University, covering its history, endowment, libraries, notable alumni, and achievements. The facts list many individuals who have connections with Harvard, including alumni, faculty, and affiliated institutions.

I should create questions that are relevant to this information. Each question needs to be unique and cover different aspects of Harvard's history or notable people associated with it.

Let me go through the facts and context to find varied topics. For example, one question could be about when Harvard was founded. Another might ask about a notable alumni from a specific field, like a Nobel laureate. I also need to ensure that each answer is accurate and directly extractable from the context or facts provided.

I should avoid repeating similar questions and make sure each question pertains to different aspects of Harvard. Let me draft some potential questions:

1. When was Harvard University founded?
2. Who is known for co-founding the Association of American Universities?
3. How many libraries make up Harvard's library system?
4. What Harvard president expanded the university into a research institution?
5. Which Ivy League school is mentioned in the context?

I need to ensure each question has only one correct answer based on the provided information.

Let me check the facts for specific names. For instance, Charles W. Eliot was a president who expanded the university. The library system consists of 79 libraries with about 20 million items. The Association of American Universities was co-founded in 1900 by Harvard.

Now, I'll structure each question to be clear and relevant, ensuring the answers are concise, up to 10 words each.

I should also format them correctly as per the example, using semicolons and ensuring no markdown formatting.

Finally, I'll review all questions to ensure they're distinct and cover a broad range of topics related to Harvard University.
