Okay, so I need to generate a quiz based on the provided context about the immune system. The user wants 10 question-answer pairs in Portuguese, each separated by a semicolon and formatted as a CSV. Let me break this down.

First, I'll read through the context carefully to understand the key points. It talks about what the immune system is, its two main subsystems—innate and adaptive—and how they function. There's also information about different organisms' immune systems, including bacteria and jawed vertebrates like humans. Additionally, it covers immune system disorders like autoimmune diseases and immunodeficiency.

Now, I need to create 10 questions that cover these topics without being too broad or vague. The answers should be concise, no more than 10 words each. Let me start brainstorming some potential questions.

1. What is the main function of the immune system? Probably something like "proteger contra doenças."

2. How does the adaptive immune system respond to pathogens? It creates a tailored response, so maybe "resposta adaptada e específica."

3. Mention two subsystems of the immune system. Innate and adaptive: "imune inato; imune adaptativo."

4. What is immunodeficiency? It's when the immune system isn't active enough: "sistema imunológico enfraquecido."

5. Name an autoimmune disease. For example, "lupus eritematoso sistêmico."

6. What are defensins? They're antimicrobial peptides: "peptídeos antimicrobianos."

7. What is the basis of vaccination? The creation of immunological memory: "memória imunológica."

8. How does the immune system distinguish pathogens from healthy tissue? Through recognition mechanisms like antibodies.

9. What happens in autoimmune diseases? The immune system attacks healthy tissues.

10. What do jawed vertebrates have that others don't? More sophisticated defense mechanisms.

Wait, some of these might be too vague or not directly answered in the context. Let me check each against the text to ensure accuracy. For example, point 9 should specify that it's a hyperactive immune system attacking normal tissues.

Also, I need to make sure all answers are in Portuguese and correctly formatted. Each pair should have the question first, then the answer separated by a semicolon. No markdown or extra formatting—just plain text with line breaks for each pair.

Let me structure this step by step:

1. Read context thoroughly.
2. Identify key terms and concepts: immune system functions, subsystems (innate vs adaptive), mechanisms like phagocytosis, complement system, defensins, immunodeficiency, autoimmune diseases, vaccination basis.
3. Formulate questions that target each concept without being too broad.
4. Ensure answers are direct and within 10 words.
5. Translate everything into Portuguese accurately.

I think I have a solid list of topics to cover. Now, I'll draft the questions and answers accordingly, making sure they align with the context provided.
