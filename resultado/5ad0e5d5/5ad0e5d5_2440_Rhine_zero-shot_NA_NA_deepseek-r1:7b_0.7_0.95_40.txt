Okay, I need to create a quiz with 10 question-answer pairs based on the given context about the Rhine River. Each pair should be in CSV format with only one correct answer and no multiple-choice options.

First, I'll review the context to identify key facts that can turn into questions. The context provides details like geographical locations, borders, lengths of the river, mentions of other rivers (like Danube), historical significance (Roman Empire), notable cities along its course, and climate aspects related to water flow.

I should make sure each question is clear and directly relates to a specific fact from the context. The answers need to be concise, as they are supposed to be short phrases or words.

Let me list out the main points:

1. The Rhine starts in Graubünden, Switzerland.
2. It forms parts of several Swiss state borders.
3. After Switzerland, it contributes to the Franco-German border.
4. The river flows mostly north through Germany before turning west and emptying into the North Sea.
5. Its length is about 1,230 km (760 miles) with average discharge around 2,900 m³/s.
6. It was a significant navigable waterway for trade in the Roman Empire.
7. Castles along its course show its historical prominence.
8. Notable cities include Cologne, Rotterdam, Düsseldorf, Duisburg, Strasbourg, Nijmegen, and Basel.

Now, I'll create 10 questions based on these points:

1. Starting point of the Rhine: Graubünden.
2. Part of Swiss state borders it forms part of.
3. Border after Switzerland becomes part of.
4. Direction the river flows through Germany mostly.
5. Another German state named after the river besides North Rhine-Westphalia.
6. Length in kilometers.
7. Roman Empire's northern inland boundary involved with.
8. The only other river mentioned alongside the Rhine.
9. City along its course known for a castle.
10. Climate affecting water flow.

I'll ensure each question is clear and concise, avoiding ambiguity. Each answer should be accurate and directly related to the context provided. Also, I need to use only semicolons as separators without any additional text or formatting beyond the CSV structure.

Double-checking to make sure there are exactly 10 pairs with correct information.
