Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the provided context about construction. Let me start by reading through the context carefully to identify key points.

First, the context mentions that construction comes from Latin and Old French. That's a good point for a question about the origin of the word. Then, it talks about the definition of construction, which could be another question. The process involved in construction, from planning to demolition, is another area. The contribution to GDP, both in 2012 and the projected 2030 figures, are important stats. Also, the mention of the industry being hazardous with 20% of US fatalities in 2019 is a key point. 

I should make sure each question is clear and directly related to the context. The answers need to be concise, under 10 words. Let me list out possible questions and their answers:

1. What is the origin of the word "construction"? Answer: Latin "constructio" and Old French.
2. What does construction primarily involve? Answer: Building, infrastructure, industrial facilities.
3. What are the main stages in construction? Answer: Planning, financing, design, building, maintenance, demolition.
4. What was global construction expenditure in 2012? Answer: $4 trillion.
5. What is the projected global construction expenditure in 2030? Answer: $14.8 trillion.
6. What percentage of US industry fatalities in 2019 were in construction? Answer: 20%.
7. What are the non-monetary benefits of construction? Answer: Economic development, job creation, infrastructure improvement.
8. What is the definition of "construction" as a noun? Answer: The nature of how something is built.
9. Which industries are most hazardous according to the context? Answer: Construction industry.
10. How does construction contribute to GDP? Answer: Significant contribution, 13% of global GDP.

I need to check that each answer is under 10 words and that the questions are phrased correctly. Also, ensuring that the CSV format is correct with semicolons and proper line breaks. Let me verify each pair again for accuracy and conciseness.
