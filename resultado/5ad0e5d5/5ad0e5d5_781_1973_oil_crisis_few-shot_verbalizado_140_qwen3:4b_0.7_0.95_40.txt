Okay, I need to generate 10 questions and answers in CSV format based on the provided context about the 1973 oil crisis. Let me start by understanding the context thoroughly.

The context mentions that the 1973 oil crisis began in October 1973 when OAPEC members, led by Saudi Arabia, proclaimed an oil embargo targeting nations that supported Israel during the Yom Kippur War. The embargo extended to several countries, and by March 1974, oil prices rose nearly 300%, leading to the "first oil shock." It was followed by the 1979 crisis, called the "second oil shock."

Now, I need to create 10 distinct questions. Let me brainstorm possible questions based on the key points: start date, embargo, countries targeted, price increase, effects, terms used, etc.

First question: When did the 1973 oil crisis start? Answer: October 1973.

Second: What was the reason for the oil embargo? Answer: Nations that supported Israel during the Yom Kippur War.

Third: Which countries were initially targeted by the embargo? Answer: Canada, Japan, Netherlands, UK, USA.

Fourth: When did the embargo end? Answer: March 1974.

Fifth: What was the percentage increase in oil prices? Answer: 300%.

Sixth: What was the term used for the 1973 crisis? Answer: First oil shock.

Seventh: What happened in 1979? Answer: Second oil shock.

Eighth: What was the main cause of the crisis? Answer: Embargo by OAPEC.

Ninth: What was the effect on global economy? Answer: Oil crisis with short and long-term effects.

Tenth: Who led the OAPEC members? Answer: Saudi Arabia.

Wait, but I need to make sure each question is unique and answers are concise. Let me check if these are all correct based on the context. Also, the answers should be short, under 10 words. Let me adjust if necessary. For example, the answer for the first question is "October 1973" which is correct. The answer for the embargo reason is "nations that supported Israel during the Yom Kippur War," which is accurate. The countries targeted are listed correctly. The price increase is 300%, which matches the context. The terms "first oil shock" and "second oil shock" are mentioned. The cause is the embargo by OAPEC. The effect is the oil crisis with various effects. The leader is Saudi Arabia.

I think these questions are all valid and cover different aspects. Now, I need to format them into CSV with the correct separators and ensure no repetition. Let me make sure each question is unique and the answers are correct based on the given context.
