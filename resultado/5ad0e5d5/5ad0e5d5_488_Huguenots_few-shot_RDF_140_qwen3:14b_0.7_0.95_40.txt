Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the provided context and facts. Let me start by reading through the context carefully to understand the key points about the Huguenots.

First, the Huguenots were French Protestants following the Reformed or Calvinist tradition. The term might be derived from a Swiss political leader, Bezanson Hugues. They were concentrated in southern and western parts of France. The French Wars of Religion lasted from 1562 to 1598, ending with the Edict of Nantes, which granted them autonomy. Later, under Louis XIV, the Edict of Fontainebleau in 1685 revoked their rights, leading to persecution and exodus. The Edict of Versailles in 1787 ended official persecution, and the Declaration of the Rights of Man in 1789 gave them equal rights.

Looking at the facts, there are some RDF triples, but they might not be as useful as the context. I'll focus more on the context text. I need to make sure the questions cover different aspects: origins, timeline, key events, leaders, locations, and the impact of edicts.

Let me brainstorm possible questions:

1. What was the religious tradition of the Huguenots? (Reformed/Calvinist)
2. Where were they concentrated in France? (Southern and western parts)
3. What was the term's origin? (Swiss political leader Bezanson Hugues)
4. When did the French Wars of Religion occur? (1562-1598)
5. What ended the wars? (Edict of Nantes)
6. What was the Edict of Nantes? (Granted autonomy)
7. Under which king was persecution increased? (Louis XIV)
8. What was the Edict of Fontainebleau? (Revoked Protestant rights)
9. When did the Edict of Versailles happen? (1787)
10. What did the Declaration of the Rights of Man do? (Gave equal rights)

Now, I need to ensure that each answer is concise, under 10 words, and directly from the context. Also, avoid repeating similar questions. Let me check if these cover the main points without overlap. Looks good. Now, format them into CSV with semicolons.
