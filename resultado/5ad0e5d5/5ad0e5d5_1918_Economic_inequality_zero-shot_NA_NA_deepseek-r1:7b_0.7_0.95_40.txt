Okay, so I need to help generate a quiz based on the provided context about economic inequality. The user wants 10 pairs of question and correct answer in CSV format. Let me start by reading through the context carefully.

The context talks about various types of economic inequality, like income and wealth inequality, different measurement methods such as the Gini coefficient and Inequality-adjusted Human Development Index, key concepts like equity and opportunity equality, effects of globalization on inequality both within and between nations, trends in income distribution over time, links to political instability, and government policies.

I should extract important facts from this context that can be turned into questions. Each question needs to be clear and relevant to the context.

1. The first thing I notice is about the two main types of inequality: income and wealth. So a straightforward question could ask for the primary measure of economic inequality, which would be income distribution.

2. The context mentions globalization has reduced global inequality but increased within nations. A true/false question here makes sense.

3. It says that between nations, income inequality peaked in the 1970s. That gives me a specific year to ask about.

4. Advanced economies have seen significant increases in inequality over the last 30 years. Again, asking for whether this is true and the time frame.

5. The Gini coefficient is mentioned as a widely used measure. So a question about its use would be good.

6. The Inequality-adjusted Human Development Index (IHDI) is another key measure. A definition question fits here.

7. Equity isn't just fairness; it's more about outcomes and opportunities, so asking what equity involves makes sense.

8. The text mentions that inequality within nations has increased with globalization, which can be a true/false question.

9. Wealth inequality is measured using the distribution of wealth, distinguishing it from income inequality.

10. The IHDI takes into account factors beyond just economic status like health and education access, so asking what aspects it considers would work.

I should ensure each answer is concise, up to 10 words. Let me double-check each question for clarity and accuracy based on the context provided.
