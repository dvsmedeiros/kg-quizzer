Okay, so I need to generate a CSV based on the given instructions and rules. Let's start by understanding what's required.

First, the user provided some context about being an AI assistant that can output in CSV format with specific columns: data, type, value. The response should be concise, clear, and within 500 words. Also, they gave an example of how to structure it for a "Hello World" scenario, which is helpful.

Now, looking at the problem statement, I need to create a CSV that includes information about the Yuan Dynasty. There's a lot of data provided in the form of text and RDF triples. The user also mentioned using columns like data, type, value.

I should parse through the information given to extract key facts about the Yuan Dynasty. From the context, I can see details such as founder, duration, capital, religion, etc. Also, there are specific dates and other attributes in the RDF data that need to be included.

I'll start by listing out all the relevant pieces of information:

1. The dynasty is known as the Yuan Dynasty.
2. It was established in 1271.
3. It ended in 1368.
4. Kublai Khan is a significant figure, possibly the founder.
5. The capital was Shangdu.
6. Languages included Chinese and Middle Mongol.
7. Religions practiced were Buddhism, Tengrism/Heaven worship, Shamanism, Taoism, Confucianism, etc.
8. There's mention of various events and leaders.

I'll structure each row in the CSV to capture these details with appropriate labels. For example:

- Dynasty: Yuan
- Established: 1271
- Ended: 1368
- Founder: Kublai Khan
- Capital: Shangdu

I also need to ensure that all entries are concise and fit into the specified columns without exceeding the word limit.

Now, putting it all together, I'll create rows for each piece of data with the corresponding type and value. This will make the CSV clear and organized.
