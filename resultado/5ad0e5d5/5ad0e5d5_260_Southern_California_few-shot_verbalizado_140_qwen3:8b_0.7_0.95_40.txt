Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the provided context and facts about Southern California. First, I need to understand the context given. The main paragraph describes Southern California as a region in the southern part of California, including specific counties and borders with Arizona, Nevada, and Mexico. The facts list various entities, people, companies, and other details associated with Southern California.

I need to make sure each question is unique and covers different aspects. Let me start by identifying key points from the context and facts. The region includes ten counties, borders with Arizona, Nevada, and Mexico, and is known as SoCal. The facts mention specific places like Los Angeles, San Diego, and various companies and individuals associated with the region.

I should avoid repeating questions about the same counties or borders. Let me brainstorm possible questions. For example, asking about the abbreviation (SoCal), the number of counties (10), the bordering states (Arizona, Nevada, Mexico), notable cities (Los Angeles, San Diego), and some of the companies or institutions mentioned in the facts. Also, the area size and population details might be relevant.

Wait, the user's example includes questions about the number of counties, the bordering states, and the abbreviation. I should ensure that the questions are varied and not just about the same topics. Let me check the facts again to find other unique points. There are mentions of specific images, models used in Wikipedia, and some earthquakes affecting the region. However, the user's example doesn't include those, so maybe focus on the main geographical aspects first.

I need to make sure each answer is concise, up to 10 words. Let me structure each question and answer pair, ensuring they are based on the provided information. Also, avoid any markdown and just output the CSV. Let me verify that each answer is directly inferable from the context or facts provided. Once I have 10 unique pairs, I can format them correctly.
