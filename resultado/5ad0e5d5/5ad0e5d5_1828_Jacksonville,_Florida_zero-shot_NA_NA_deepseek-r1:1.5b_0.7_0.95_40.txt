Okay, I need to create 10 pairs of question and answer based on the provided context about Jacksonville, Florida. First, I should read through the context thoroughly to understand all the key points.

Let me break down the context into key facts:

1. Jacksonville is located on the Atlantic coast.
2. It's near the U.S. state border.
3. It has a city proper in Miami.
4. It's the largest city by area in the contiguous United States.
5. It has 949,611 residents, making it the 12th most populous city globally.
6. The metropolitan area population is about 1.7 million.
7. It straddles the St. Johns River.
8. It's a popular tourist destination with beaches and ports.
9. Tourism contributes to its economy.
10. There are different names for people living there, like "Jacksonville Villians" or "Jaxsons."

Now, I need to generate 10 distinct questions that cover various aspects of the city. Let me think about each point.

1. Where is Jacksonville located? This is straightforward and covers the location aspect.
2. What is the state border near Jacksonville? It can be combined with the first question for consistency.
3. Is Miami a city proper in Jacksonville? Yes, that's an interesting fact to include.
4. How many residents does Jacksonville have? A direct number question could work here.
5. Is Jacksonville the largest city by area in the U.S.? Yes, another fact to include as a question.
6. What is the metropolitan area population of Jacksonville? This can be used for a question about its size.
7. Where straddles the St. Johns River? It's in the First Coast region, so that's a location detail.
8. Is it a major tourist destination? Yes, this ties into the tourist aspect mentioned.
9. What are some popular names for people living there? That covers the naming conventions.

I should ensure that each question is clear and relevant to the context. I'll keep the language consistent with Portuguese as per the instructions, using short answers. Separating each question with a semicolon and the answer after will format it correctly.

Let me draft some questions:

- Quanto e onde está locado Jacksonville?
- O que se encaixa corretamente em seu perimeter? (Answer: Miami)
- O qual é o número de habitantes de Jacksonville?
- O que designa o First Coast region? (Answer: St. Johns River)
- O qual é o population do metropolitan area de Jacksonville?
- Quais são os nomes comuns dos habitantes de Jacksonville?

Wait, I should check if all these cover different aspects and fit the context accurately. Also, ensuring that each answer is within 10 words to meet the requirement.

I think this covers a good range of questions from general locations to specific economic details. Now, let me format them correctly.
