Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the provided context about British Satellite Broadcasting (BSB). Let me start by understanding the context and the facts given.

First, the context mentions that BSB was a TV company based in London, started broadcasting on March 25, 1990, and merged with Sky Television plc on November 2, 1990, forming British Sky Broadcasting. The facts section includes various RDF triples from DBpedia, which provide more details about BSB's relationships with TV channels, films, and other entities. There are also classifications like being a company, organization, etc., and information about its founding date, location, and successor.

Now, I need to create 10 varied questions. Let me list possible topics:

1. Founding date of BSB
2. Merging with Sky Television
3. Location (headquartered in London)
4. Services provided (direct broadcast satellite)
5. TV channels owned (like Galaxy, Now, etc.)
6. Films produced (Hardware, Memphis Belle)
7. Classification as a company
8. Successor after merger (Sky UK)
9. Categories it's associated with (like 1980s in British TV)
10. Notable films or channels associated with BSB

Each question should have a concise answer, up to 10 words. Let me check the facts again to ensure accuracy.

For example, the founding date is 1986-12-11, so the answer would be "1986-12-11". The merger date is November 2, 1990. The location is London. Services are direct broadcast satellite. TV channels include Galaxy, Now, The Movie Channel, etc. Films are Hardware, Memphis Belle. Classification is company/organization. Successor is Sky UK. Categories include 1980s in British TV, 1990 mergers, etc.

I need to avoid repeating similar questions. Let me make sure each question is distinct. Also, the answers must be directly from the context or inferable. Let me structure each line as "pergunta;resposta".

Double-checking for any possible duplicates or overlaps. Once all 10 are ready, format them as CSV with semicolons. That should cover the requirements.
