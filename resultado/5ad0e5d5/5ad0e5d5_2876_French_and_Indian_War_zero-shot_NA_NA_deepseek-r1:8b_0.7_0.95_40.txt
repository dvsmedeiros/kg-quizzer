Okay, I need to help the user generate 10 question-answer pairs based on the provided context about the French and Indian War. The output should be a CSV file with each line containing a relevant question and a correct short answer in Portuguese, separated by semicolons.

First, I'll read through the context carefully to identify key points and events. The war was part of the Seven Years' War, involved the British colonies against the French, with Native American tribes on both sides. Important battles and events include Jumonville Glen, Fort Duquesne, Braddock's defeat, Fort Beauséjour, Acadian expulsion, Siege of Fort William Henry, Louisbourg expedition failure, William Pitt's role, Ohio Country victory, capture of Quebec, Montreal Campaign, Treaty of Paris, and French retention of Saint Pierre and Miquelon.

I need to formulate questions that are relevant but not too complex. Each question should have a clear and concise answer, limited to 10 words or less.

Let me start by listing possible questions:

1. Who were the main Native American allies of the French?
2. What was the significance of the Battle of Jumonville Glen?
3. Which province did George Washington command in during the early part of the war?
4. How did the British perform in their frontier campaigns initially?
5. Which event led to the expulsion of Acadians?
6. What happened at Fort Beauséjour in 1755?
7. Who was the British commander at the Battle of the Monongahela?
8. Why were the British having trouble in the Ohio Country?
9. What resulted from William Pitt's increased military support?
10. Which city did the British capture in Canada during the war?

Now, formulating the answers based on the context:

1. The Wabanaki Confederacy supported the French.
2. It was George Washington's first command.
3. He was a 22-year-old leading Virginia militiamen.
4. They failed due to poor management and Native allies.
5. Acadians were expelled between 1755-1764.
6. Fort Beauséjour was captured by British forces in 1755.
7. Braddock led the attack but was defeated.
8. Initial campaigns were unsuccessful because of French scouts and Native help.
9. The victory in Ohio led to further British actions.
10. Quebec was captured in 1759.

I need to ensure that each question is clear, uses correct terminology, and the answers are accurate. Also, check word count for responses to keep them under 10 words.

Now, I'll write out the CSV accordingly, making sure each line has a semicolon-separated pair.
