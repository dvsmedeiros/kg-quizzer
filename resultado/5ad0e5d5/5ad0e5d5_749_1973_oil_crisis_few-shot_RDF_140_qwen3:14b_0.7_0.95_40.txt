Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the provided context about the 1973 oil crisis. Let me start by reading through the context carefully to understand the key points.

The context mentions that the crisis began in October 1973 when OAPEC, led by Saudi Arabia, imposed an oil embargo on countries supporting Israel during the Yom Kippur War. The targeted countries initially were Canada, Japan, the UK, the US, and later others. The embargo ended in March 1974, with oil prices rising nearly 300% from $3 to $12 per barrel. It's called the first oil shock, followed by the 1979 crisis.

Now, looking at the example, the questions are about dates, causes, effects, and terminology. I need to ensure variety and avoid repetition. Let's brainstorm possible questions:

1. When did the 1973 oil crisis start? Answer: October 1973.
2. Which organization led the embargo? Answer: OAPEC, led by Saudi Arabia.
3. Who was the embargo targeted against? Answer: Countries supporting Israel in the Yom Kippur War.
4. What was the initial price increase? Answer: Nearly 300%.
5. When did the embargo end? Answer: March 1974.
6. What was the price of oil after the embargo? Answer: Nearly $12 per barrel.
7. What was the term used for this crisis? Answer: First oil shock.
8. Which countries were initially targeted? Answer: Canada, Japan, UK, US, Netherlands.
9. What was the impact on the global economy? Answer: Short- and long-term effects.
10. What followed this crisis? Answer: 1979 oil crisis (second oil shock).

I need to check if all answers are inferable from the context. Also, ensure that each question is unique and covers different aspects. Let's verify each answer against the context to make sure they are accurate and concise. Now, format them into CSV with semicolons.
