Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the provided context about Harvard University. Let me start by reading through the context carefully to identify key points.

First, the main facts: Harvard is a private Ivy League university in Cambridge, Massachusetts, founded in 1636. It's the oldest in the US and one of the most prestigious. It has ten academic faculties, including the Harvard Radcliffe Institute. The Faculty of Arts and Sciences offers undergraduate and graduate programs, while others offer graduate degrees. There are three campuses: Cambridge, Allston, and Longwood. The endowment is $50.9 billion, the largest in the world. The library has 20.4 million items. It was founded by the Massachusetts colonial legislature, initially training Congregational clergy, but became secularized in the 18th century. It transformed into a research university under Charles William Eliot, co-founded the Association of American Universities, and has many notable alumni and achievements.

Now, I need to create questions that test knowledge of these points. Let's brainstorm possible questions:

1. What is the name of the university mentioned in the text? Answer: Harvard University.
2. Where is Harvard University located? Answer: Cambridge, Massachusetts.
3. When was Harvard University founded? Answer: 1636.
4. What is the primary purpose of the Harvard Radcliffe Institute? Answer: Not specified, but the text says it's part of the university's structure.
Wait, the text says "The university is composed of ten academic faculties plus Harvard Radcliffe Institute." So maybe the answer is that it's a research institution or part of the university's structure. But the answer needs to be short. Alternatively, maybe the question is about its role. The text doesn't specify its purpose, so perhaps the answer is that it's a research institution. But I need to check if that's correct. The text mentions it's part of the university's composition, but not its specific function. Maybe the answer is that it's a research institution, but the text doesn't state that. Alternatively, maybe the question is about what the Radcliffe Institute is, but the text doesn't elaborate. Hmm, maybe that's a stretch. Alternatively, the answer could be that it's part of the university's structure. But that's not a specific answer. Maybe the question is not about the Radcliffe Institute's purpose but about its inclusion. Alternatively, maybe the answer is that it's a research institution. But since the text doesn't mention that, maybe I should avoid that. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is that it's a research institution. Wait, the text says "The Faculty of Arts and Sciences offers study in a wide range of undergraduate and graduate academic disciplines, and other faculties offer only graduate degrees, including professional degrees. Harvard has three main campuses... Harvard's endowment... Harvard Library... Harvard's founding... Its curriculum... By the 19th century... Following the American Civil War... The college developed multiple affiliated professional schools that transformed the college into a modern research university." So maybe the answer is that the Radcliffe Institute is part of the university's research structure. But the text doesn't explicitly state that. Maybe the answer is that it's a research institution, but that's an assumption. Alternatively, maybe the question is about the Radcliffe Institute's role, but the text doesn't specify. Maybe I should avoid this question. Maybe I should focus on other points.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is that the Radcliffe Institute is part of the university's structure. But the answer needs to be short. Alternatively, maybe the question is about the Radcliffe Institute's function, but since the text doesn't specify, I need to check if there's another way. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is that it's a research institution. Maybe the text says that Harvard is a research university, so the Radcliffe Institute is part of that. But that's an inference. Maybe it's better to avoid that. Let me think of other questions.

Another point: the endowment is $50.9 billion. So a question about that. How many campuses does Harvard have? Three. The main campus is Cambridge, the Allston in Boston, and Longwood. The library is the world's largest academic library. The founding was authorized by the Massachusetts colonial legislature. The university has 8 US presidents among its alumni. The endowment per student is fifth-largest in the US. The alumni include 188 living billionaires. The text mentions that Harvard has 10 academic faculties plus the Radcliffe Institute. So a question about the number of academic faculties. Answer: ten. Or the answer is that it's composed of ten academic faculties plus the Radcliffe Institute. But the answer needs to be concise.

So, possible questions:

1. Which university is the oldest in the United States? Answer: Harvard University.
2. Where is Harvard University located? Answer: Cambridge, Massachusetts.
3. When was Harvard University founded? Answer: 1636.
4. How many academic faculties does Harvard University have? Answer: Ten.
5. What is the name of the largest academic library in the world? Answer: Harvard Library.
6. What is the value of Harvard's endowment? Answer: $50.9 billion.
7. How many campuses does Harvard University have? Answer: Three.
8. What is the name of the university's main campus in Cambridge? Answer: Harvard Yard.
9. How many US presidents are Harvard alumni? Answer: Eight.
10. How many living billionaires are Harvard alumni? Answer: 188.

Wait, but the text says "its alumni include eight U.S. presidents and 188 living billionaires, the most of any university." So yes, that's correct. Also, the endowment per student is fifth-largest in the US. So maybe a question about that, but the answer is short. Alternatively, maybe the answer is that it's the fifth-largest. But the user said the answer should be short, up to 10 words.

Let me check if these are correct based on the text. The answer for question 4: the text says "The university is composed of ten academic faculties plus Harvard Radcliffe Institute." So the number of academic faculties is ten. So that's correct.

Question 5: Harvard Library is the world's largest academic library system. So the answer is Harvard Library.

Question 6: The endowment is valued at $50.9 billion.

Question 7: Three main campuses.

Question 8: The main campus is 209 acres, centered on Harvard Yard. So the answer is Harvard Yard.

Question 9: Eight US presidents.

Question 10: 188 living billionaires.

That's 10 questions. Now, I need to make sure each answer is concise. Let me check each one:

1. Harvard University (correct)
2. Cambridge, Massachusetts (correct)
3. 1636 (correct)
4. Ten (correct)
5. Harvard Library (correct)
6. $50.9 billion (correct)
7. Three (correct)
8. Harvard Yard (correct)
9. Eight (correct)
10. 188 (correct)

Yes, these are all correct based on the text. So the CSV should have these 10 pairs.
