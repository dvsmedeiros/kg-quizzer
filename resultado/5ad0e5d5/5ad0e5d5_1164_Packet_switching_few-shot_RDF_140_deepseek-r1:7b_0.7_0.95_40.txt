Okay, I need to generate 10 question-response pairs in CSV format based on the provided context and facts. The context is about packet switching, its history, and related concepts. I should make sure each question is unique and relevant, with a correct short answer.

First, I'll start by understanding the key points from the given information:

- Packet switching was developed by Paul Baran at RAND.
- It contrasts with circuit switching.
- Donald Davies is credited with naming it packet switching.
- The concept aimed to provide fault-tolerant routing for telecommunication messages.
- It emerged after the Bell System's approach.

Now, I'll think of different aspects of packet switching to form questions:

1. Who developed packet switching?
2. What does packet switching do?
3. How is it different from circuit switching?
4. Who is credited with coining the term?
5. For whom was Paul Baran's work intended?
6. When did packet switching become prominent?
7. Which company used this concept in their network?
8. Packet switching relies on what for directing packets?
9. What kind of data is processed through packet switches?
10. A main goal of the initial work by Paul Baran was...

I need to make sure each question maps to one correct answer from the context and that there's no repetition.

Let me draft these questions and answers:

1. Who developed packet switching? → Paul Baran
2. What is packet switching? → Grouping data into packets for transmission.
3. How does it differ from circuit switching? → Packet switching transmits data in packets, while circuit switching uses dedicated circuits.
4. Who coined the term packet switching? → Donald Davies.
5. For whom was Paul Baran's work intended? → Pre-allocation of network bandwidth at RAND.
6. When did packet switching become prominent? → After the 1960s.
7. Which company used this concept in their network? → ARPANET.
8. Packet switches use headers to direct packets by... → Networking hardware.
9. What type of data is processed through packet switches? → Information.
10. A primary goal was providing efficient, fault-tolerant routing.

I'll ensure each answer is concise and fits within 10 words as per the example.

Finally, I'll format them into a CSV with the separator ";".
