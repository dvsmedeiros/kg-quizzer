Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the provided context about geology. Let me start by understanding the context.

The context is a paragraph explaining geology as a natural science, its scope, and its importance. Then there's a list of facts about people and things related to geology. The examples given in the few-shot include questions about rock types, processes, and geological phenomena.

First, I should make sure the questions are varied and cover different aspects of geology as mentioned in the context. The answers should be concise and directly inferable from the text. I need to avoid repeating similar questions. Let me brainstorm possible topics: types of rocks, processes that shape them, geological history, uses of geology, related fields, and maybe some specific terms or terms related to the facts provided.

Looking at the example questions, they cover rock types, processes like metamorphism, the formation of magma, the three main rock types, factors affecting mineral content, plate tectonics discovery, parts of the Earth in the lithosphere, the asthenosphere, and the discovery of seafloor spreading. Also, there's a question about the decade of seafloor spreading discovery.

I need to ensure that my questions are unique. Let me check the facts provided. The facts list names of people in geology, journals, and other related entities. Maybe some questions can be about these, but the user's example didn't include that. The example questions were more about geological processes and concepts.

So, sticking to the main concepts: rock types, geological processes, Earth's structure, plate tectonics, mineral content, and maybe some terms like lithosphere, asthenosphere, and seafloor spreading. Also, the context mentions that geology is part of integrated Earth system science and planetary science.

Let me think of 10 distinct questions. For example:

1. What are the three main types of rocks?
2. What process forms metamorphic rocks?
3. What is the primary evidence for plate tectonics?
4. What is the study of Earth's structure and processes called?
5. What are the factors that change the mineral content of rocks?
6. What is the role of geology in understanding Earth's history?
7. What is the term for the Earth's outer rigid layer?
8. What is the main use of geology in practical terms?
9. What is the primary tool used to determine the age of rocks?
10. What is the main field of study that geology overlaps with?

Now, I need to check if these are covered in the context. The context says geology is a branch of natural science, studies Earth's features, processes that change them, and provides tools to determine rock ages. It also mentions plate tectonics as primary evidence, and the three main rock types. The lithosphere is part of the Earth's structure. The primary tool is probably radiometric dating. The role of geology includes mineral exploration, water resources, natural hazards, etc.

Wait, the example answer for "What is the primary tool used to determine the age of rocks?" was "radiometric dating". But in the example, the answer was "radiometric dating" for a question about determining the age of rocks. However, the user's example had a different answer for that. Let me check the example again.

Looking back, the example had: "O que muda o conteúdo mineral de uma rocha?;calor e à pressão" and another example was "Quando os três tipos de rocha são derretidos, o que é formado?;novo magma". So the answer for the primary tool is "radiometric dating" but in the example, they didn't have that. However, the user's example for the primary tool wasn't there. But according to the context, geology uses tools to determine relative and absolute ages of rocks. The answer would be "radiometric dating" or "absolute dating methods".

But the user's example had "calor e à pressão" for the mineral content. So the answer should be based on the context. Let me make sure that the answers are in the context.

Another point: the context says geology is part of integrated Earth system science and planetary science. So maybe a question about that.

Also, the example included "O que muda o conteúdo mineral de uma rocha?;calor e à pressão" which is about the factors changing mineral content.

So, I need to generate 10 such questions. Let me make sure each is unique and based on the context. Let's proceed to list them.
