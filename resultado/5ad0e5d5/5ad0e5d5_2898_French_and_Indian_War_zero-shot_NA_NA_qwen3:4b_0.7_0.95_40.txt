Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the provided context about the French and Indian War. Let me start by understanding the context thoroughly.

The context covers the French and Indian War (1754–1763), which was part of the Seven Years' War. Key points include the conflict between British and French colonies in North America, support from Native American tribes, major events like the Battle of Jumonville Glen, Braddock's defeat, the Acadian Expulsion, and the eventual British victory leading to the Treaty of Paris. 

I should focus on creating questions that test knowledge of the key events, outcomes, and participants. Let me brainstorm possible questions:

1. What was the main conflict in the French and Indian War?
2. Which French Canadian name is associated with the war?
3. Who was the British commander in 1755?
4. What was the name of the French fort at the Forks of the Ohio?
5. What significant event led to the British capturing Fort Beauséjour?
6. What treaty ended the French and Indian War?
7. Which Native American tribes supported the British?
8. What was the outcome of the Montreal Campaign?
9. What was the name of the French fort that was captured in 1759?
10. What was the result of the Acadian Expulsion?

Now, I need to ensure each question is concise and the answers are short (up to 10 words). Let me check the context again to confirm the accuracy of each answer.

1. The main conflict was between British and French colonies, supported by Native tribes. Answer: "Conflict between British and French colonies."
2. The French Canadian name is "gierre de la Conquête." Answer: "Guerre de la Conquête."
3. The British commander was General Edward Braddock. Answer: "General Edward Braddock."
4. The French fort was Fort Duquesne. Answer: "Fort Duquesne."
5. The British captured Fort Beauséjour after expelling the Acadians. Answer: "Expulsion of the Acadians."
6. The Treaty of Paris ended the war. Answer: "Treaty of Paris."
7. The British were supported by Iroquois, Catawba, Cherokee. Answer: "Iroquois, Catawba, and Cherokee."
8. The Montreal Campaign led to the French ceding Canada. Answer: "French ceded Canada."
9. The French fort captured in 1759 was Quebec. Answer: "Quebec."
10. The Acadians were expelled from Nova Scotia. Answer: "Expulsion of the Acadians."

I need to make sure the answers are correct and concise. Also, check that each question is relevant and based on the given context. Once confirmed, format them into the CSV as specified.
