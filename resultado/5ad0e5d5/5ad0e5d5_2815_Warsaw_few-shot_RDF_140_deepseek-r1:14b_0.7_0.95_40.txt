Okay, so the user has provided a large block of RDF data about Warsaw, and they want me to generate a CSV based on that. Let me see what I need to do here.

First, looking at the data, it's in RDF format with various predicates. The main subject is <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Warsaw>, which is Warsaw itself. There are several properties attached to it, like aprSnowDepthCm, augRecordHighC, and others related to climate data. Then there are foaf:depiction links pointing to images on Wikimedia.

The user's instruction is to generate a CSV following the given instructions and rules. Since I don't have the exact "Instruções e Regras" in front of me, I'll assume they want something standard. Probably, they want each predicate as a column and each object as a row value.

So, the first step is to identify all the predicates used here. Let's list them:

- aprSnowDepthCm
- augRecordHighC
- decMeanC
- decRecordHighC
- febLowC
- marRecordHighC
- mayPrecipitationDays
- metricFirst
- postalCode
- source
- foaf:depiction

These will become the headers in the CSV. Now, each of these has corresponding object values from the RDF data. For example, aprSnowDepthCm has "1" as its value.

The tricky part is handling the depictions. These are URLs pointing to images, so I'll need to extract just the filename or maybe the full URL for each image. Since there are two depiction properties, that will translate into two separate rows, each with one depiction URL and the other fields null, unless we decide to handle them differently.

Wait, but in CSV, each row should represent a single predicate-object pair? Or should it be more like one row per subject with all predicates as columns?

Looking at the data again, it's about Warsaw itself, so it's a single subject with multiple predicates. So the CSV should have one row for Warsaw, and each column represents a different property.

But wait, looking back at the user's initial message, they might be expecting to list each predicate-object pair as separate rows, which would result in multiple rows. For example, if there are 10 properties, you'd have 10 rows, each with two columns: Predicate and Object.

Alternatively, it could be a single row with all the predicates as headers and their corresponding values. But considering that depictions have multiple URLs, that might complicate things because we can't have multiple cells in one column for a single row unless we split them into separate lines.

Hmm, perhaps the user wants each predicate to have its own row, even if it's the same subject. So the CSV would look like:

Predicate,Object

aprSnowDepthCm,1

augRecordHighC,38

... and so on.

But then, for depictions, we have two URLs, so two rows under that predicate.

Alternatively, maybe they want all properties in one row with columns as per each predicate. But since depictions have multiple values, this might not fit neatly into a single CSV row unless we can handle multiple entries somehow, perhaps comma-separated within the cell.

Given that the user didn't specify, I'll go with the first approach: each predicate gets its own row. So the CSV will have two columns: Predicate and Object, and each line represents one predicate-object pair.

But looking back at the data, some predicates are numbers, others are strings. For example, postalCode is "0", which is a string but might be treated as numeric in the CSV.

Also, for depictions, we'll need to handle the URLs correctly. They start with 'http', so they should be kept as strings without issues.

So putting it all together, I'll list each predicate and its corresponding object value on separate lines in the CSV.
