Okay, I need to create 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the given context about the 1973 oil crisis. Let me start by understanding the context thoroughly.

The context mentions that the 1973 oil crisis began in October 1973 with OAPEC members, led by Saudi Arabia, imposing an embargo on countries supporting Israel during the Yom Kippur War. The embargo targeted specific nations initially and later extended to others. The oil price increased by 300%, from $3 to $12 per barrel, and this had significant effects on global politics and economy, leading to the "first oil shock."

Now, I need to generate 10 relevant questions. Each question should be concise, and the answers should be short, up to 10 words. Let me brainstorm possible questions:

1. What event triggered the 1973 oil crisis?
   - Answer: Yom Kippur War.

2. Which organization imposed the oil embargo?
   - Answer: Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries.

3. When did the 1973 oil crisis begin?
   - Answer: October 1973.

4. What was the initial target of the embargo?
   - Answer: Canada, Japan, Netherlands, UK, US.

5. How much did oil prices rise by?
   - Answer: 300% increase.

6. What was the oil price before the crisis?
   - Answer: $3 per barrel.

7. What was the oil price after the crisis?
   - Answer: $12 per barrel.

8. What was the impact of the embargo?
   - Answer: Global oil crisis and economic effects.

9. What was the crisis called later?
   - Answer: First oil shock.

10. Which countries were later targeted?
    - Answer: Portugal, Rhodesia, South Africa.

Wait, some answers might be too long. Let me check the word count. For example, "Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries" is 7 words, which is under 10. "Global oil crisis and economic effects" is 6 words. "First oil shock" is 3 words. The initial targets list is 5 countries, but maybe I can shorten it. Alternatively, maybe rephrase the questions to make answers shorter. Let me adjust.

For question 4: "Which countries were initially targeted?" Answer: Canada, Japan, Netherlands, UK, US. (5 countries, 5 words.)

Question 5: "What was the price increase?" Answer: 300% increase. (4 words.)

Question 6: "What was the pre-crisis oil price?" Answer: $3 per barrel. (4 words.)

Question 7: "What was the post-crisis oil price?" Answer: $1,2 per barrel. (3 words, but maybe better to write $12 per barrel as in the context.)

Wait, the original context says "from US$3 per barrel ($19/m3) to nearly $12 per barrel ($75/m3) globally." So maybe the answer for question 7 is $12 per barrel. That's 4 words.

Question 8: "What were the effects of the embargo?" Answer: Global oil crisis and economic impact. (6 words.)

Question 9: "What was the crisis later called?" Answer: First oil shock. (3 words.)

Question 10: "Which countries were later targeted?" Answer: Portugal, Rhodesia, South Africa. (3 countries, 3 words.)

I need to make sure all answers are under 10 words. Let me verify each answer:

1. Yom Kippur War. (4 words)
2. Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries. (7 words)
3. October 1973. (3 words)
4. Canada, Japan, Netherlands, UK, US. (5 words)
5. 300% increase. (4 words)
6. $3 per barrel. (4 words)
7. $12 per barrel. (4 words)
8. Global oil crisis and economic impact. (6 words)
9. First oil shock. (3 words)
10. Portugal, Rhodesia, South Africa. (3 words)

All answers are within the limit. Now, format them into CSV with semicolons. Make sure each line is "pergunta;resposta" without any extra text. Let me arrange them in order.
