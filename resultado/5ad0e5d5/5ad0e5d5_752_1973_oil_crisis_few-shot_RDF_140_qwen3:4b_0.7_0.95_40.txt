Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the provided context about the 1973 oil crisis. Let me start by understanding the context thoroughly.

The context mentions that the 1973 oil crisis began in October 1973 when OAPEC members, led by Saudi Arabia, proclaimed an oil embargo. The embargo targeted nations that supported Israel during the Yom Kippur War. The initial targets were Canada, Japan, Netherlands, UK, and the US, with the embargo extending to Portugal, Rhodesia, and South Africa. By March 1974, oil prices rose nearly 300%, from $3 to $12 per barrel. The crisis was called the "first oil shock," followed by the 1979 crisis as the "second oil shock."

Now, I need to create varied questions that are relevant and have single correct answers. Let me list possible topics: start date, key players, target countries, duration, price increase, terms used, effects, etc.

First question: When did the 1973 oil crisis start? Answer: October 1973.

Second: Which organization led the embargo? Answer: OAPEC, led by Saudi Arabia.

Third: Which countries were initially targeted? Canada, Japan, Netherlands, UK, US.

Fourth: When did the embargo end? March 1974.

Fifth: What was the price of oil before and after the embargo? Before: $3, after: $12.

Sixth: What was the term for the 1973 crisis? First oil shock.

Seventh: What was the term for the 1979 crisis? Second oil shock.

Eighth: What was the main reason for the embargo? To target nations that supported Israel during the Yom Kippur War.

Ninth: What were the long-term effects? Global political and economic effects.

Tenth: Which countries were later added to the embargo? Portugal, Rhodesia, South Africa.

Wait, the example given in the prompt includes questions about when the embargo was proclaimed, the price increase, the term used, the countries targeted, etc. I need to make sure each question is unique and based on the context. Also, the answers must be short, up to 10 words.

Let me check if I have 10 distinct questions. Let me list them again:

1. When did the 1973 oil crisis begin? October 1973.
2. Who led the oil embargo? OAPEC, led by Saudi Arabia.
3. Which countries were initially targeted? Canada, Japan, Netherlands, UK, US.
4. When did the embargo end? March 1974.
5. What was the price of oil before and after? $3 to $12.
6. What term was used for the 1973 crisis? First oil shock.
7. What term was used for the 1979 crisis? Second oil shock.
8. Why was the embargo imposed? Target nations supporting Israel.
9. What were the long-term effects? Global political and economic effects.
10. Which countries were added later? Portugal, Rhodesia, South Africa.

Wait, the example in the prompt had a question about when the embargo was proclaimed, which is October 1973, which is the same as the first question. But in the example, the answer is "outubro de 1973," which is correct. So I need to make sure the questions are not repeating. Let me adjust to ensure variety.

Alternatively, maybe the answer to the third question is the list of initial countries, but the example in the prompt has a question about which countries were targeted, and the answer is "Canadá, Japão, Holanda, Reino Unido e Estados Unidos." So that's correct.

Another possible question: Which organization was responsible for the embargo? OAPEC. But the example already includes that.

Wait, the user provided an example with the answer "membros da Organização dos Países Exportadores de Petróleo Árabes" for the question "Quem proclamou o embargo do petróleo?" So that's correct.

I need to make sure that each question is unique. Let me check again.

I think I have 10 questions. Now, I need to format them in CSV, each line as "pergunta;resposta".

Let me make sure the answers are within 10 words. For example, the answer to the question about the price increase is "quase US $ 12" which is 5 words.

Another answer: "segundo choque do" (second oil shock) is 4 words.

Yes, all answers are short. Now, I need to ensure that the questions are in Portuguese and based on the provided context. Also, check for any possible repetition or errors.

I think that's all. Let me compile the 10 pairs now.
