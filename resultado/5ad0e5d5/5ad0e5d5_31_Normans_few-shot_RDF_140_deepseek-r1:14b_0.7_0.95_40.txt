Okay, so I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs in Portuguese based on the given context about the Normans. The output should be a CSV with each line formatted as "pergunta;resposta". Let me start by carefully reading through the provided abstract and triples to understand key points.

First, from the abstract, I know that Normans emerged in medieval Normandy from Viking settlers and indigenous populations. Their identity began forming in the 10th century, they were known for their martial skills and later became Catholic. They conquered England, Sicily, and other places. Key figures include Rollo, William the Conqueror, and Richard I.

Looking at the triples, there are mentions of various battles involving Normans, like the Battle of Hastings and others. Also, notable people such as Alexander of Paris and Hauteville family are linked to them. Their language evolved into Norman French, which is still spoken in some places. The Duchy of Normandy's history with France is also important.

Now, I need to create varied questions covering different aspects: origins, key events, leaders, locations, cultural impacts, etc. Each question should have a unique and correct answer from the context.

Let me list possible questions:

1. Where are Normans originally from? (Vikings)
2. When did their identity form?
3. What language did they speak?
4. Who was Rollo's role?
5. Which English king was Norman?
6. Who led at Hastings?
7. Under whom Normandy became a duchy.
8. What religion were Normans?
9. What's the origin of "Norman"?
10. When was Latin "Normanni" first recorded?

Wait, I should check if these answers are supported by the context.

1. They originated from Viking settlers in West Francia. So, answer could be "Vikingos" or specify it as Norse peoples.
2. Identity formed in 10th century.
3. Spoke Old Norman and Latin.
4. Rollo was a key leader, perhaps the first Duke.
5. Henry II, but also William the Conqueror became king of England.
6. William led at Hastings.
7. Rollo's role was foundational; he signed the treaty with Charles the Simple.
8. They were Catholic by the 10th century.
9. From Old Norse "Norðrmanaz".
10. Context says 10th century, but the Latin term might have been recorded later. I need to confirm.

Wait, the context says "by the tenth century" for their identity formation and that the Latin form was used starting then. So question 10's answer would be the 10th century.

I should structure each question clearly and ensure the answers are concise. Let me draft them:

Question 1: Where were the Normans originally from? Answer: Viking settlers in West Francia.

Wait, actually, they were a mix of Vikings and indigenous populations. Maybe better to say they originated from Viking settlers in Normandy.

But perhaps a better phrasing is "De onde os normandos originaram-se?" with answer "Os normandos tiveram origem nos assentamentos vikinganos na região que viria a ser a Normanha."

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me look for the exact terms used in the context.

The abstract says: "the Normans emerged from Viking settlers and indigenous populations." So perhaps:

1. De onde os normandos tiveram origem? Resposta: Os normandos surgiram a partir de assentamentos vikinganos e populações indígenas na região que viria a ser a Normanha.

2. Em qual século surgiu a identidade normanda? Resposta: No século X.

3. Qual língua falavam os normandos? Resposta: Falavam normano antigo e latim.

4. Quem foi o líder que estabeleceu a Normanha com um tratado em 911? Resposta: Rolo, o fundador da Normanha após o Tratado de Sainte-Suzanne.

5. Qual monarca inglês era normando? Resposta: Guilherme, o Conquistador.

6. Quem liderou os normandos na Batalha de Hastings em 1066? Resposta: Guilherme, o Conquistador.

7. Em que século a Normanha se tornou um ducado independente? Resposta: No século XI.

8. Qual foi a religião dos normandos após sua conversão? Resposta: O cristianismo.

9. De onde provém o termo "normando"? Resposta: Do norruega antigo "Norðrmanaz".

10. Em qual século a forma latina "Normanni" surgiu? Resposta: No século X.

Wait, the context says that by the tenth century their identity began to form and that Latin records referred to them as Normanni starting then. So question 10's answer is the 10th century.

I think these questions cover different aspects without overlapping too much. I should ensure each answer is accurate per the context.
