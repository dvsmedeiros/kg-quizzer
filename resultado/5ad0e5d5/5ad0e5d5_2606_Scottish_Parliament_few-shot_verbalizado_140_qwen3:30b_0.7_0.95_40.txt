Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs in Portuguese based on the given context about the Scottish Parliament. Let me start by understanding the context thoroughly.

First, the Scottish Parliament is the devolved, unicameral legislature of Scotland, located in Edinburgh. It has 129 MSPs elected through a mixed system. The original Parliament of Scotland existed until 1707 when it merged with England to form the UK. The current Parliament was established after the 1997 referendum, with powers defined by the Scotland Act 1998. The UK Parliament can modify the Scottish Parliament's powers. The first meeting was in 1999, and there have been amendments over time, like the 2012 and 2016 acts. The UK Internal Market Act 2020 affects its autonomy.

Now, looking at the facts provided, there are many triples about constituencies, regions, parties, and other details. But the main focus should be on the context given. The user wants questions that are varied and cover different aspects. Let me brainstorm possible questions.

1. When was the current Scottish Parliament established? Answer: After the 1997 referendum.
2. What act defined the legislative powers? Answer: Scotland Act 1998.
3. What are the areas the Parliament can legislate? Answer: All except reserved ones.
4. Who retains the power to amend the Parliament's powers? Answer: UK Parliament.
5. When did the first meeting occur? Answer: 12 May 1999.
6. Which act expanded tax and welfare powers? Answer: Scotland Act 2012 and 2016.
7. What restricts the Parliament's regulatory autonomy? Answer: UK Internal Market Act 2020.
8. How many MSPs are there? Answer: 129 members.
9. What is the voting system? Answer: Additional member system.
10. When was the last election? Answer: 6 May 2021.

Wait, some answers need to be concise, under 10 words. Let me check each:

1. "After the 1997 referendum" – 5 words. Good.
2. "Scotland Act 1998" – 2 words. Good.
3. "All areas not reserved to Westminster" – 6 words. Maybe "All except reserved ones" is better.
4. "UK Parliament" – 2 words.
5. "12 May 1999" – 3 words.
6. "Scotland Act 2012 and 2016" – 5 words.
7. "UK Internal Market Act 2020" – 5 words.
8. "129 members" – 2 words.
9. "Additional member system" – 3 words.
10. "6 May 2021" – 3 words.

I need to ensure the answers are directly from the context. For example, the first meeting was in 1999, the election in 2021. The Scotland Act 1998 defines reserved powers. The UK Parliament can amend the powers. The 2012 and 2016 acts expanded powers. The Internal Market Act 2020 restricts autonomy. The number of MSPs is 129. The voting system is additional member. The last election was 2021.

I should also check for any other details. For example, the Parliament is unicameral, but that's not in the context. The facts mention "unicameral" in the categories, but the context says "unicameral legislature." So maybe a question about that. But the user might prefer more direct answers from the context.

Another possible question: What is the location? Answer: Edinburgh, Scotland. But the context says "located in Edinburgh" and "localizado em Scotland" in the facts. However, the user might prefer the answer as "Edinburgh, Scotland" but need to check word count. "Edinburgh, Scotland" is 3 words. That's acceptable.

But I have to make sure not to use any facts that aren't in the context. The context mentions "Edinburgh, Scotland" as the location. So maybe include that as a question.

But I have 10 questions. Let me check the initial list and adjust if needed. Maybe replace one of the questions with the location. Let's see:

Original list:

1. When was the current Scottish Parliament established? Answer: After the 1997 referendum.
2. What act defined the legislative powers? Answer: Scotland Act 1998.
3. What are the areas the Parliament can legislate? Answer: All except reserved ones.
4. Who retains the power to amend the Parliament's powers? Answer: UK Parliament.
5. When did the first meeting occur? Answer: 12 May 1999.
6. Which act expanded tax and welfare powers? Answer: Scotland Act 2012 and 2016.
7. What restricts the Parliament's regulatory autonomy? Answer: UK Internal Market Act 2020.
8. How many MSPs are there? Answer: 129 members.
9. What is the voting system? Answer: Additional member system.
10. When was the last election? Answer: 6 May 2021.

This covers the key points. Now, ensure answers are accurate and concise. For example, "All except reserved ones" is correct as per the context. "UK Parliament" is the correct answer for who can amend. The location is Edinburgh, Scotland, but that's not in the initial list. Maybe replace one of the questions with that. Alternatively, stick with the current list.

I think this should meet the requirements. Now, format them into CSV.
