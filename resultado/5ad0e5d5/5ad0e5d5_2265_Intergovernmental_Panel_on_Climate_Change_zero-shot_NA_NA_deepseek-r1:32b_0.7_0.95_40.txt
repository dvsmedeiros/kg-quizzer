Okay, so I need to generate a quiz based on the given context about the IPCC. The user wants 10 question-answer pairs in Portuguese, formatted as CSV with semicolons separating each question and answer.

First, I'll read through the context carefully to identify key points that can form questions. Let's list out the main facts:

1. The IPCC is part of the United Nations.
2. It was established by WMO and UNEP in 1988.
3. It has a secretariat in Geneva hosted by WMO.
4. There are 195 member states.
5. An assessment cycle lasts about six to seven years.
6. The IPCC doesn't do original research; it compiles existing literature.
7. Thousands of scientists volunteer as reviewers.
8. The Fifth Assessment Report influenced the Paris Agreement in 2015.
9. The Sixth Assessment began in 2015 and will conclude in 2023.
10. They released special reports on global warming, climate change and land, and ocean/cryosphere.

Now, I'll form questions around these points. Each question should be clear and specific enough to have a short answer, preferably one word or a short phrase.

For example:
- When was the IPCC established? Answer: 1988.
- Where is the secretariat located? Geneva, Switzerland.
- How many member states are there? 195.
- What's the duration of an assessment cycle? Six to seven years.
- Does IPCC do original research? No.

I need to make sure each question has a clear and concise answer. I'll also vary the structure of questions to include different types, like 'how many', 'where', 'when', etc., to keep it interesting.

Once I have all 10 questions, I'll translate them into Portuguese, ensuring correct grammar and terminology. Then, format them as CSV with semicolons separating each question and answer.
