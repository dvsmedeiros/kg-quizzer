Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the provided context about steam engines. Let me start by understanding the context thoroughly.

The context talks about steam engines being heat engines using steam as a working fluid, their operation with pistons and cylinders, the Rankine cycle, historical developments like Thomas Newcomen and James Watt's contributions, their role in the Industrial Revolution, and their eventual replacement by electric motors and turbines. 

I should identify key points and formulate questions that test understanding of these points. Each question should be concise, and the answers should be short, up to 10 words. Let me list possible questions:

1. What is the primary working fluid in a steam engine?
   Answer: Steam.

2. How does a steam engine convert pressure into motion?
   Answer: Pushes piston via steam pressure.

3. What cycle models steam engine operation?
   Answer: Rankine cycle.

4. When were steam engines first used commercially?
   Answer: 1712 by Thomas Newcomen.

5. What improvement did James Watt make?
   Answer: Condensation in separate vessel.

6. What replaced steam engines in the 20th century?
   Answer: Electric and internal combustion engines.

7. What type of engines are steam engines classified as?
   Answer: External combustion engines.

8. What replaced reciprocating engines in power generation?
   Answer: Steam turbines.

9. What was the first commercially successful steam engine?
   Answer: Thomas Newcomen's engine.

10. What is the aeolipile associated with?
    Answer: Early steam-driven devices.

Now, I need to ensure each answer is under 10 words and the questions are clear. Let me check for clarity and accuracy. For example, the answer to question 4 should mention the year and inventor. Also, confirm that all answers are directly from the context. Once verified, format them into CSV with semicolons.
