Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the provided context about the IPCC. Let me start by understanding the context thoroughly.

The context gives a detailed overview of the IPCC, its establishment, structure, role, reports, and recent activities. I should focus on key points like the organization's purpose, members, working groups, reports, special reports, and the sixth assessment cycle.

First, I'll list out the main topics to create questions. For example, the purpose of the IPCC, the organizations that established it, the number of member states, the assessment cycle duration, the three working groups, the role of the secretariat, the Nobel Prize, the sixth assessment cycle, the special reports, and the Synthesis Report.

Now, I need to make sure each question is relevant and the answers are concise, under 10 words. I should avoid repeating the same topics and cover different aspects. Let me check each point again to ensure accuracy.

For instance, the first question could be about the purpose of the IPCC. The answer is "Advance scientific knowledge on climate change." That's under 10 words. Next, the organizations that established it: "WMO and UNEP." Then, the number of member states: "195." The assessment cycle duration: "Six to seven years." The three working groups: "Three working groups and a task force." The secretariat location: "Geneva, Switzerland." The Nobel Prize: "Shared 2007 Nobel Peace Prize with Al Gore." The sixth assessment cycle start and end: "Began in 2015, completed in 2023." The special reports: "Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C in 2018." The Synthesis Report: "Due in March 2023."

Wait, I need to make sure all answers are accurate. The sixth assessment cycle started in 2015 and is due in 2023. The Synthesis Report is in March 2023. The special reports include the 1.5°C report, the Climate Change and Land report, and the Ocean and Cryosphere report.

I should also check if all questions are unique and cover different aspects. Let me count: 10 questions. Yes, that's covered. Now, I'll format each as per the CSV example, using semicolons and ensuring the answers are short. I need to avoid any markdown and just output the CSV.
