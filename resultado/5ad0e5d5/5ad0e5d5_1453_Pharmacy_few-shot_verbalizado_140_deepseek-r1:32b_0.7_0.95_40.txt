Okay, I need to generate a CSV with 10 question-answer pairs based on the provided context and facts about Pharmacy. Let's start by understanding what the user is asking for.

The user wants questions that are varied and cover different aspects of Pharmacy. Each question should have a short, correct answer in Portuguese, separated by a semicolon. The output must be exactly 10 lines without any markdown or extra explanations.

Looking at the context, it talks about the science and practice of Pharmacy, including roles like药剂师，药店的类型，以及药学在不同环境中的应用。还有提到一些具体的药店和相关组织。

Now, I'll go through the facts to find specific information that can form questions. For example, there's mention of Pharmacy being practiced in establishments called pharmacies or chemists. That could be a good question about synonyms.

Another point is the role of pharmacists as experts in medication therapy. That makes sense for a question about their expertise.

I also see that Pharmacy links health sciences with pharmaceutical and natural sciences, which can form a question about its interdisciplinary nature.

The community and institutional pharmacy classifications are mentioned, so a question about types of pharmacies would work.

There's information about药剂师的教育背景，比如Kristy M. Ainslie和Janine Tugonon在Pharmacy领域受过教育。这可以转化为关于专业人士培训的问题。

The context mentions that Pharmacy includes traditional roles like compounding and dispensing medications, which can be a question about these specific activities.

I should ensure each question is unique and covers different aspects: definitions, roles, classifications, education, etc. I'll also need to make sure the answers are concise and directly derived from the provided content.

Let me draft some questions:

1. What is the main goal of Pharmacy? Answer: Ensure safe, effective, and affordable medication use.
2. Who are considered experts in药疗? Pharmacists.
3. What are two types of pharmacies based on setting? Community and institutional.
4. Name a synonym for pharmacist. Chemist or Doctor of Pharmacy.
5. What is a key activity in Pharmacy? Compounding and dispensing medications.
6. How does Pharmacy connect different fields? It links health, pharmaceutical, and natural sciences.
7. What term describes the direct patient care role in pharmacies? Clinical pharmacy.
8. Where are pharmacists' services considered clinical? In community or institutional settings.
9. What is another name for a pharmacy establishment in the US? Drugstore.
10. How do药剂师contribute to treatment optimization? By reviewing medications for safety and efficacy.

I think these cover various aspects without repeating topics. Now, I'll translate them into Portuguese and ensure each answer is under 10 words.
