Okay, I need to generate 10 questions and answers in CSV format based on the provided context about the immune system. Let me start by understanding the context thoroughly. The abstract explains that the immune system is a network that protects organisms from diseases by detecting and responding to pathogens, distinguishing them from the organism's own tissue. It mentions two major subsystems: the innate and adaptive immune systems. The innate provides a preconfigured response, while the adaptive creates a tailored response with immunological memory. Dysfunction can lead to autoimmune diseases, immunodeficiency, and cancer.

Now, looking at the facts provided, there are various components like T cells, B cells, macrophages, neutrophils, etc., all part of the immune system. Also, there are some specific terms like immunodeficiency, autoimmunity, and vaccination. I need to make sure the questions are varied and cover different aspects of the immune system.

Let me brainstorm possible questions. For example, what are the two main types of immune systems? That's covered in the abstract. Then, what's the function of the innate immune system? Also, the adaptive system's role. How does the immune system distinguish between pathogens and the body's own tissue? That's a key point.

Other possible questions could be about the consequences of immune system dysfunction, like autoimmune diseases or immunodeficiency. Also, the components of the immune system, like specific cells or organs. For example, which cells are part of the immune system? Or which diseases are related to the immune system?

I need to ensure each question has a unique answer and is based on the given context. Let me check the example provided. They had questions about the system's purpose, the two types of immunity, the two main subsystems, and the effects of dysfunction.

So, I'll start by listing possible questions and their correct answers, making sure they are concise and fit within the 10-word limit. Also, avoid repeating similar questions. Let me verify each answer against the context to ensure they are accurate. For example, the answer to "What are the two main types of immunity?" is "imunidade humoral versus imunidade mediada por células," which is in the example. Another answer could be about the role of the adaptive system, which is creating immunological memory.

I should also include questions about the components, like which cells are part of the immune system (e.g., T cells, B cells, macrophages, etc.), and the role of specific mechanisms like phagocytosis or the complement system. Also, the causes of immunodeficiency and autoimmune diseases.

Wait, the user mentioned that the answer should be short, up to 10 words. So I need to keep answers concise. For example, "doenças" is the answer to the first question in the example. Similarly, "patógenos" for the second. So I need to make sure each answer is a single term or short phrase.

I think I have enough ideas. Now, I'll structure them into 10 questions, each with a correct answer, ensuring they are varied and cover different aspects of the immune system as per the given context.
