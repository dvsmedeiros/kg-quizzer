Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the provided context about Fresno. Let me start by reading through the context carefully to identify key points.

First, the city's location: it's in the San Joaquin Valley, California, and is the county seat of Fresno County. Also, it's the largest inland city in California. Population details are important too—2020 population was 542,107, making it the fifth most populous in California. The metro population is 1,008,654 as of 2022. 

Then there's the history: founded in 1872 as a railway station, incorporated in 1885. The name comes from the ash trees along the San Joaquin River. Economic aspects include being an economic hub with agriculture in the surrounding areas. Geographic position is near the center of California, distances to LA, Sacramento, San Francisco. Nearby parks: Yosemite, Kings Canyon, Sequoia. Demographics: third-largest majority-Hispanic city with 50.5% Hispanic in 2020. Droughts affecting water security since 2010.

Now, I need to create questions that cover these points. Each question should be relevant and have a concise answer. Let me list possible questions:

1. What is the population of Fresno according to the 2020 census?
2. Which river's ash trees inspired Fresno's name?
3. When was Fresno incorporated as a city?
4. What is the rank of Fresno in terms of population in California?
5. What is the metro population of Fresno as of 2022?
6. What is the primary economic role of Fresno?
7. How far is Fresno from Los Angeles?
8. Which parks are located near Fresno?
9. What percentage of Fresno's population was Hispanic in 2020?
10. What has affected water security in Fresno since 2010?

Now, check the answers for accuracy based on the context. Make sure answers are concise, under 10 words. Let me verify each:

1. 542,107 in 2020. Correct.
2. San Joaquin River. Correct.
3. 1885. Correct.
4. Fifth-most populous city. Correct.
5. 1,008,654. Correct.
6. Economic hub; agriculture. Maybe combine into "Economic hub with agriculture."
7. 220 miles north of LA. Correct.
8. Yosemite, Kings Canyon, Sequoia. Correct.
9. 50.5%. Correct.
10. Statewide droughts. Correct.

Now format into CSV with semicolons. Ensure each line is a question and answer, no markdown, just the CSV.
