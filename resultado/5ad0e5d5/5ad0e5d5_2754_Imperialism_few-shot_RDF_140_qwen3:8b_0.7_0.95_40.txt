Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the provided context about imperialism. Let me start by understanding the context. The context defines imperialism as a state policy involving extending power through territorial acquisition or political/economic control, using both hard and soft power. It also mentions that while related to colonialism and empire, it's a distinct concept.

Looking at the facts provided, there are several triples and examples. For instance, some entries link organizations or ideologies to imperialism, like the Conservative Party of Canada having imperialism as an ideology. There are also mentions of motives like the Circassian genocide being motivated by imperialism. Additionally, there are references to books and authors related to imperialism, such as "Culture and Imperialism" by Edward Said.

I need to create varied questions that cover different aspects of imperialism. Let me brainstorm possible questions. First, the definition: what is imperialism? Then, how is it administered (using hard and soft power). Also, the difference between formal and informal imperialism. Examples of countries or regions associated with imperialism, like the Portuguese Empire. Motives behind imperialism, such as the Herero and Namaqua genocide. The role of cultural and economic power. Mention of specific works like "Culture and Imperialism". The relationship between imperialism and colonialism. The use of military force. And perhaps the impact of imperialism on global spread of technologies.

Now, I need to ensure each question has a single correct answer derived from the context. For example, the question about the Portuguese Empire's era being under imperialism. Another could be about the motive of the Japanese war crimes. I should avoid repeating similar questions and ensure the answers are concise, up to 10 words. Let me check each fact to see which ones can be turned into questions. For instance, the fact that the Conservative Party of Canada had imperialism as an ideology can be a question about which party associated with imperialism. Also, the mention of "Culture and Imperialism" as a non-fiction subject. 

I need to structure each line as "pergunta;resposta". Let me list out the 10 questions and answers, making sure they are distinct and cover different aspects. Let me verify each answer is directly from the context. For example, the answer to the question about the Portuguese Angola's era being under imperialism. Also, the use of soft power in imperialism. The examples of formal imperialism like colonial domination. The distinction from colonialism. The types of power used. The role of cultural influence. The authors associated with imperialism, like Paul K. MacDonald. The examples of informal imperialism. The impact on technology spread. The difference from colonialism. 

Wait, I need to make sure the answers are accurate. For instance, the fact that the Portuguese Angola's era is linked to imperialism. Also, the mention of the Japanese war crimes motive being imperialism. The answer to the question about the motive of the Herero and Namaqua genocide. The answer to the question about the type of imperialism involving direct control would be formal. The answer to the question about the use of military force is hard power. The answer to the question about the spread of technologies and ideas is the effect of imperialism. 

I need to ensure all answers are concise and directly from the context. Let me compile the 10 pairs, checking for uniqueness and correctness. Each question should be clear and have a single answer. Once done, format them into CSV with semicolons.
