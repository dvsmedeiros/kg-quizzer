Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the given context about computational complexity theory. Let me start by understanding the context thoroughly.

The context talks about computational complexity theory, its focus on classifying problems based on resource usage, the difference between analysis of algorithms and complexity theory, the P versus NP problem, and related fields like circuit complexity and communication complexity. It also mentions the seven Millennium Prize Problems, including P vs NP.

First, I should identify key concepts and terms from the text. Important points include: classification of problems by resource usage, P vs NP, computational complexity vs analysis of algorithms, resource measures (time, storage, communication, gates, processors), and the role of computational complexity in determining practical limits of computation.

Now, I need to form questions that are relevant to these points. Each question should be short and direct, with a concise answer. Let me brainstorm possible questions:

1. What is the main focus of computational complexity theory?
2. What is the P versus NP problem associated with?
3. What is the difference between analysis of algorithms and computational complexity theory?
4. What are some measures of computational complexity?
5. What does computational complexity theory try to classify?
6. What is the role of computational complexity theory?
7. What are the resources that computational complexity theory studies?
8. What is the significance of the P versus NP problem?
9. What is the main goal of computational complexity theory?
10. What are examples of resource restrictions in computational complexity?

Now, I need to make sure the answers are accurate and within 10 words. Let me check each one against the context.

1. Focus on classifying problems by resource usage. Correct.
2. P versus NP is a Millennium Prize Problem. Correct.
3. Analysis of algorithms studies specific algorithms, while complexity theory studies all possible algorithms. Correct.
4. Time, storage, communication, gates, processors. Correct.
5. Problems that can or cannot be solved with restricted resources. Correct.
6. Determine practical limits on what computers can do. Correct.
7. Time, storage, communication, gates, processors. Correct.
8. It's a key question in complexity theory about problem-solving efficiency. Correct.
9. Classify problems based on resource requirements. Correct.
10. Resource restrictions like time, storage, etc. Correct.

Now, I need to format these as CSV pairs. Each line should be "question;answer". Let me verify each answer's length. They should be concise. For example, "P versus NP is a Millennium Prize Problem." is 8 words. All answers are under 10 words. Good.

I think that's all. Let me list them out in order.
