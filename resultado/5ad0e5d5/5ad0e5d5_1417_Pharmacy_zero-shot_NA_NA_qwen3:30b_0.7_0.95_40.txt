Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs based on the given context about pharmacy. Let me start by reading through the context carefully to understand the key points.

The context mentions that pharmacy is the science and practice of discovering, producing, preparing, dispensing, reviewing, and monitoring medications. It's a multidisciplinary field linking health sciences, pharmaceutical sciences, and natural sciences. There are two main classifications: community and institutional pharmacy. Clinical pharmacy involves direct patient care in these settings. Traditional roles include compounding and dispensing, while modern services include medication reviews and drug information. Pharmacists are experts in drug therapy. The terms "pharmacy" are used in the US, while "chemists" are used in the UK. Drugstores in the US and Canada sell various items besides medicines. The apothecary's work is a precursor to chemistry and pharmacology.

Now, I need to come up with 10 questions. Let's brainstorm possible questions:

1. What is the main goal of pharmacy? (Answer: Ensure safe, effective, and affordable use of medicines)
2. What are the two main classifications of pharmacy practice? (Community and institutional)
3. What is the role of pharmacists in clinical pharmacy? (Direct patient care)
4. Traditional roles in pharmacy include what? (Compounding and dispensing)
5. What modern services do pharmacists provide? (Medication reviews and drug information)
6. What is the term for an establishment where pharmacy is practiced in the US? (Pharmacy)
7. What term is used in the UK for the same? (Chemists)
8. What do drugstores in the US and Canada sell besides medicines? (Confectionery, cosmetics, etc.)
9. What is the historical precursor to modern chemistry and pharmacology? (Apothecary's work)
10. What is the definition of pharmacy? (Science and practice of discovering, producing, preparing, dispensing, reviewing, and monitoring medications)

Now, check if the answers are concise (under 10 words). Let's adjust as needed. For example, the first answer could be "Ensure safe, effective, and affordable use of medicines." That's 8 words. The second answer: "Community and institutional pharmacy." That's 3 words. The third: "Direct patient care." Good. Fourth: "Compounding and dispensing." Fifth: "Medication reviews and drug information." Sixth: "Pharmacy." Seventh: "Chemists." Eighth: "Confectionery, cosmetics, office supplies, toys, hair care products, magazines." Wait, that's more than 10 words. Need to shorten. Maybe "Miscellaneous items like confectionery, cosmetics, and office supplies." But the original answer was "confectionery, cosmetics, office supplies, toys, hair care products and magazines." Let me count: 10 words. So that's okay. Ninth: "Apothecary's work." Tenth: "Science and practice of discovering, producing, preparing, dispensing, reviewing, and monitoring medications." That's 14 words. Need to shorten. Maybe "Science and practice of drug discovery, production, preparation, dispensing, review, and monitoring." That's 13 words. Still a bit long. Alternatively, "Science and practice of drug discovery, production, and monitoring." Hmm, but the original answer is more accurate. Maybe accept it as is, since the user allows up to 10 words. Wait, the user says "até 10 palavras" (up to 10 words). So need to make sure each answer is 10 words or less. Let me check each:

1. "Ensure safe, effective, and affordable use of medicines." 8 words.
2. "Community and institutional pharmacy." 3 words.
3. "Direct patient care." 3 words.
4. "Compounding and dispensing." 3 words.
5. "Medication reviews and drug information." 5 words.
6. "Pharmacy." 1 word.
7. "Chemists." 1 word.
8. "Confectionery, cosmetics, office supplies, toys, hair care products and magazines." 10 words.
9. "Apothecary's work." 2 words.
10. "Science and practice of discovering, producing, preparing, dispensing, reviewing, and monitoring medications." 11 words. Oops, that's 11. Need to shorten. Maybe "Science and practice of drug discovery, production, and monitoring." 7 words. But that's less accurate. Alternatively, "Science and practice of drug discovery, production, preparation, dispensing, review, and monitoring." 11 words. Still too long. Maybe "Science and practice of drug discovery, production, and monitoring." 7 words. Acceptable, even if slightly less detailed.

So adjusting the 10th answer to fit under 10 words. Now, compiling all into CSV format with semicolons.
