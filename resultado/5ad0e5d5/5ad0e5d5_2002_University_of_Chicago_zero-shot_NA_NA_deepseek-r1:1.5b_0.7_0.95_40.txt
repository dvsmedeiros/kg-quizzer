Alright, I need to create a CSV with ten question-response pairs based on the provided context about the University of Chicago. Let me start by reading through the context carefully to identify key points.

First, the context talks about the main campus in Chicago and mentions several professional schools there. It also lists additional campuses in other cities and includes notable events like the man-made nuclear reaction experiment.

I should focus on questions that can be answered from this information. The first question could be about the location of the university's main campus, which is clearly stated as Chicago. That seems straightforward.

Next, I need a question related to academic programs. The context mentions several professional schools, so asking about their number makes sense—Chicago has eight professional schools listed there.

For another question, focusing on notable events like the man-made nuclear reaction experiment would be interesting. Mentioning the location and what it was for adds depth.

I can also explore a different aspect by asking about Nobel laureates in the university's history—this provides context on the institution's achievements and its impact on science.

Another thought is to inquire about the number of Nobel laureates, which ties into the broader context provided. This question would be useful for assessing the institution's influence.

I should also consider a question related to notable alumni or distinguished faculty members. The context mentions Fields Medalists, Turing Award winners, and others, so this could cover significant figures in different areas.

Thinking about the structure of the CSV, each row will have two columns: "pergunta" with relevant questions and "resposta" with correct answers. I need to ensure that each answer is concise up to ten words or less as per the instructions.

I should avoid any complex questions; instead, focus on straightforward information from the given context. This ensures the CSV remains simple yet informative.

Let me draft some questions:

1. Where is the main campus located?
2. How many professional schools does the university have?
3. When was the man-made nuclear reaction experiment conducted?
4. Who were some Nobel laureates in this university?
5. What notable institutions and centers are associated with Chicago UChicago?

Each of these questions aligns with points from the context, providing relevant information that can be answered confidently.

Now, I'll write each question and its answer accordingly.
