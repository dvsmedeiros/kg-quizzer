Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the provided context about the Scottish Parliament. Let me start by reading through the context carefully to understand the key points.

The context mentions the Scottish Parliament is a devolved, unicameral legislature in Edinburgh, known as Holyrood. It has 129 members (MSPs) elected under the additional member system. There's info about the 2021 election, the history of the original Parliament of Scotland merging with England in 1707, the 1997 referendum leading to devolution, the Scotland Act 1998, and recent acts like the 2012, 2016, and 2020 laws affecting its powers.

I need to extract 10 relevant questions. Let me brainstorm possible questions:

1. What is the Scottish Parliament known as? (Answer: Holyrood)
2. How many members are in the Scottish Parliament? (Answer: 129 members)
3. What system is used for electing MSPs? (Answer: Additional member system)
4. When was the most recent general election? (Answer: 6 May 2021)
5. Which party won the 2021 election? (Answer: Scottish National Party)
6. What was the original Parliament of Scotland called? (Answer: Parliament of Scotland)
7. When did the Kingdom of Scotland merge with England? (Answer: 1707)
8. What act established devolution powers? (Answer: Scotland Act 1998)
9. Which act expanded Parliament's powers on taxation? (Answer: Scotland Act 2012)
10. What does the UK Internal Market Act 2020 aim to restrict? (Answer: Devolved competences)

Now, I need to ensure each answer is concise (under 10 words) and the questions are clear. Let me check the answers for brevity and accuracy. Also, make sure the CSV format uses semicolons and no markdown. Alright, time to format the CSV as specified.
