Okay; let's tackle this. The user provided a bunch of RDF triples in Turtle format and wants a CSV file based on specific instructions. The main goal is to map the data correctly.
But how to get the person's name from their URI? The name is the label in the URI. For example; http://dbpedia.org/resource/Robert_Lucas_Jr. would have the name "Robert Lucas Jr.".
- For each subject URI (person); extract the name by replacing underscores with spaces and removing the "http://dbpedia.org/resource/" part.
Now; let's process the data.
First; the university's own attributes:
Then; for each person:
Looking through the data; there are multiple entries. For example:
For each line that starts with a person's URI followed by a predicate and the university URI; create a row.
Now; the challenge is to parse all these lines and extract the necessary information.
Another thing to note is that the university's URI is the same for all; so any triple where the object is that URI is a relation to the university.
Now; the user's data has the university's own attributes. Let's check the last line:
Now; compiling all these into the CSV.
I think that's the plan. Now; proceed to generate the CSV.
