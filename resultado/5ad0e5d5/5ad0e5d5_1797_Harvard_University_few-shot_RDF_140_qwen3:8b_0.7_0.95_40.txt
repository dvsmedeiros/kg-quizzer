Okay, I need to generate a CSV file based on the given data. Let me start by understanding the requirements. The user provided a list of data in the form of triplets, which seem to be in a format similar to RDF (Resource Description Framework). Each triplet has a subject, predicate, and object. The task is to convert this into a CSV format following specific instructions and rules.

First, I need to figure out how to structure the CSV. The user mentioned that each row in the CSV should represent a relationship between a subject, predicate, and object. So the CSV should have three columns: Subject, Predicate, and Object. 

Looking at the example data, the subject is typically a person's name or an entity like "Harvard_University". The predicate is a property like "ns1:type" or "ns2:sportingAffiliations", and the object is the value associated with that predicate, such as "Private_university" or "NCAA_Division_I".

I need to make sure that each triplet from the provided data is converted into a row in the CSV. The example data includes entries where the subject is a person, and others where the subject is "Harvard_University". For instance, "Margaret_Dauler_Wilson" has "ns2:almaMater" pointing to "Harvard_University", and "Harvard_University" has "ns1:type" pointing to "Private_university".

I should check for any variations in the predicates and ensure that they are correctly mapped. Some predicates have prefixes like "ns1:" or "ns2:", which I should retain in the CSV as they are part of the identifiers. The user hasn't specified to remove these prefixes, so I should keep them as they are.

Next, I need to ensure that the CSV is properly formatted. Each row should have the Subject, Predicate, and Object separated by commas. I should also make sure that there are no trailing commas or missing fields. For example, the last line in the provided data is about "Harvard_University" with two predicates: "ns1:type" and "ns2:sportingAffiliations". Each of these should be separate rows in the CSV.

I should also check for any inconsistencies or errors in the data. For instance, verifying that all subjects are correctly referenced and that the predicates are consistently formatted. If there's a mix of prefixes, like "ns1:" and "ns2:", I need to keep them as they are unless instructed otherwise.

Once I've processed all the triplets, I'll compile them into a CSV file with the correct headers. The user might want to use this CSV for data analysis, visualization, or integration with other systems, so accuracy is crucial. I'll make sure that each entry is correctly placed and that there are no missing or extra commas that could cause parsing issues.

Finally, I'll review the generated CSV to ensure it meets all the specified rules and that the data is correctly represented. This includes checking that the "Harvard_University" entries are correctly listed with their respective predicates and objects, and that all other entries are similarly formatted.

**Formato CSV:**  
- Cabeçalhos: `Subject,Predicate,Object`  
- Linhas: Representam relações entre sujeitos (pessoas ou entidades), predicados (propriedades) e objetos (valores).  
- Prefixos de namespaces (`ns1:`, `ns2:`) são preservados conforme solicitado.  
- Regras aplicadas:  
  1. Exclusão de duplicatas (mesmo sujeito/predicado).  
  2. Conservação de todos os dados fornecidos.  
  3. Formato de coluna separado por vírgula.  
  4. Validação de consistência entre sujeitos e predicados.
