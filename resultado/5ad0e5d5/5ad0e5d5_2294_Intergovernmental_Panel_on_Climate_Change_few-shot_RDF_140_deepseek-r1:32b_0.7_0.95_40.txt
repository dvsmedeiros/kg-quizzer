Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs in Portuguese based on the given context about the IPCC. Let me start by understanding the context thoroughly.

The IPCC is an intergovernmental body of the United Nations, established in 1988 by WMO and UNEP. It's headquartered in Geneva and has 195 member states. The current chair is Hoesung Lee from South Korea. They produce assessment reports every six to seven years, with the sixth cycle concluding in 2023. Notable reports include the Fifth Assessment Report influencing the Paris Agreement, the Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C in 2018, and others.

Looking at the facts section, there are individuals associated with the IPCC, such as Bert Bolin, who was the first chair. The organization's structure includes working groups and a task force, and they've won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2007 alongside Al Gore.

I should create varied questions covering different aspects: establishment, leadership, reports, functions, member states, etc. Each question must have a single correct answer from the context.

Let me draft potential questions:

1. When was the IPCC established?
2. Which organizations created the IPCC?
3. How many member states does the IPCC have?
4. Who is the current chair of the IPCC and his nationality?
5. What's the main purpose of the IPCC reports?
6. What significant agreement did the Fifth Assessment Report influence?
7. When was the Special Report on 1.5°C published?
8. Which Nobel Prize did the IPCC win, and in what year?
9. How often are the assessment cycles?
10. What does the IPCC not do (e.g., conduct original research)?

Now, I'll phrase these in Portuguese, ensuring each question is clear and the answer is concise.

I should also check that each question is unique and covers different topics to ensure a broad range of information.
