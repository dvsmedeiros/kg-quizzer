Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the provided context about Warsaw. Let me start by reading through the context carefully to identify key facts and details.

First, the context mentions that Warsaw is the capital and largest city of Poland. That's a good starting point for a question. Maybe ask for the capital of Poland. The answer would be Warsaw.

Next, the River Vistula is mentioned as where Warsaw stands. So a question could be about the river, and the answer would be Vistula.

The population within the city is 1.86 million, and the metropolitan area is 3.1 million. I can create a question about the city's population, specifying the exact figure.

The city area is 517 km², which is a specific number. A question could ask for the city area, with the answer being 517 km².

Warsaw is an Alpha global city, so a question about its status as a global city. Answer: Alpha global city.

The city was the de facto capital of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth until 1795. That's a historical fact. A question about the Commonwealth's capital.

The 19th century brought a demographic boom, making it one of Europe's largest cities. A question about the 19th-century growth.
