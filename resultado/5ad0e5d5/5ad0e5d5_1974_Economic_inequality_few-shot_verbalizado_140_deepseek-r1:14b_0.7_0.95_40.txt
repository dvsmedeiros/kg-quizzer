Alright, so the user has given me a task to generate 10 pairs of questions and answers in CSV format based on a provided context about economic inequality. The instructions are clear, but I need to make sure I understand all the requirements before proceeding.

First, I'll read through the context carefully. It's an abstract discussing various aspects of economic inequality, including types like income and wealth inequality, methods for measuring it such as the Gini coefficient, and the impact of globalization. It also mentions that while global inequality between nations has decreased, within-nation inequality has increased in many advanced economies. There are references to researchers like Branko Milanović and organizations like Oxfam and Credit Suisse.

Next, I look at the facts provided. These include various categories, such as Economic inequality being a type of WikicatEconomicIndicators, associated images, and mentions of people like Richard G. Wilkinson and institutions like Nathan Cummings Foundation. There's also information about specific books and movements related to economic inequality.

Now, considering the example CSV provided by the user, I notice that each line is a question followed by a short answer in Portuguese, separated by semicolons. The questions cover different aspects of economic inequality, such as percentages, methodologies, and causes.

I need to generate 10 unique questions based on the context and facts given. Each question should have one correct answer derived from or inferable from the provided information. I'll make sure not to repeat similar questions and vary the topics covered—like percentages, methods, impacts, etc.

Let me start brainstorming possible questions:

1. What percentage of global wealth does the top 1% hold? (From Oxfam reports)
2. How has globalization affected within-nation inequality?
3. Which researcher is prominent in this field? (Branko Milanović)
4. How much did income inequality increase in advanced economies? (Over 70% with Gini coefficients exceeding two points)
5. What does the Gini coefficient measure?
6. What policy tool reduces income inequality? (Taxes and transfers, particularly public spending)
7. Which book discusses economic inequality? (Capital in the Twenty-First Century by Piketty)
8. How has global income distribution changed since the 1970s? (Convergence towards middle-income countries)
9. What is a widely used measure of economic inequality? (Gini coefficient)
10. What is a significant consequence of economic inequality? (Political and social instability, hindered growth)

I'll need to phrase these in Portuguese and ensure the answers are concise, fitting within 10 words each.

Now, I'll structure each line as "pergunta;resposta" in CSV format, making sure there are exactly 10 lines. I'll double-check that each question is unique and covers different aspects of economic inequality.
