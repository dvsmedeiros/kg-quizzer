Okay, I need to generate 10 CSV entries based on the given context and facts. Let me start by understanding the user's instructions carefully.

The user wants 10 pairs of question and answer in CSV format. Each line should be a question followed by a short answer (up to 10 words). The language is Portuguese. The example provided shows that the answers are concise and directly related to the context given.

Looking at the context, the main topic is civil disobedience, which is defined as the active refusal to obey laws, often nonviolently. The example mentions Henry David Thoreau, Susan B. Anthony, Saad Zaghloul, Mahatma Gandhi, and Martin Luther King Jr. as key figures. There are also examples of movements and events, like the Egyptian Revolution of 1919, the Civil Rights Movement, and the 2021 End SARS protests.

The facts list various events and movements that use civil disobedience. Some examples are the 2018–2019 Iranian strikes, the North Kosovo crisis, the 2022 Kazakh unrest, and the Gwangju Uprising. Also, there are references to specific people and organizations like Tony Milligan, Ruckus Society, and the Sisters Uncut.

I need to make sure the questions are varied and cover different aspects of civil disobedience: definitions, historical figures, events, movements, and related terms. I should avoid repetition and ensure each answer is unique and directly from the context or facts provided.

Let me start by creating questions based on the definition. For example, asking how civil disobedience is defined. Then, mentioning key figures like Thoreau, Gandhi, and King. Then, specific events like the Egyptian Revolution of 1919, the Civil Rights Movement, and the 2021 End SARS protests. Also, movements like the Women in the Yellow Vests, the Gwangju Uprising, and the 2022 Kazakh unrest. Maybe also the use of nonviolent resistance and the purpose of civil disobedience.

I need to check that each answer is a short phrase, up to 10 words. Let me list possible questions and their answers:

1. Definition: "Ativo, professo desrespeito a leis consideradas injustas."
2. Thoreau's contribution: "Popularizou a termo em EE.UU."
3. Gandhi's use: "Protestos contra a ocupação britânica."
4. King's role: "Movimento de direitos civis nos EUA."
5. Egyptian Revolution of 1919: "Contra a ocupação britânica."
6. Civil Rights Movement: "Protestos não violentos."
7. End SARS protests: "Contra a polícia no Brasil."
8. Women in the Yellow Vests: "Contra a desigualdade."
9. Gwangju Uprising: "Contra a repressão."
10. Kazakh unrest: "Contra a corrupção."

Wait, but some answers might not be accurate. Let me check the facts again. The End SARS protests were in Nigeria, not Brazil. The Women in the Yellow Vests were in France. The Gwangju Uprising was in South Korea. The Kazakh unrest was in Kazakhstan. The answer should be precise.

So, correcting:

7. End SARS protests: "Contra a polícia no Nigéria."
8. Women in the Yellow Vests: "Contra a desigualdade e impostos."
9. Gwangju Uprising: "Contra a repressão policial."
10. Kazakh unrest: "Contra a corrupção."

Also, need to ensure that the answers are in Portuguese and accurate based on the context. The example given in the prompt mentions the 2018–2019 Iranian strikes, so that's a valid example.

I should also include the example of the 2021 End SARS memorial protest, which is mentioned in the facts. Also, the 2022 Kazakh unrest. The Women in the Yellow Vests movement is another example. The Gwangju Uprising is another key event.

Now, making sure each answer is a short phrase. Let me check each one again and ensure they are correct and concise.
