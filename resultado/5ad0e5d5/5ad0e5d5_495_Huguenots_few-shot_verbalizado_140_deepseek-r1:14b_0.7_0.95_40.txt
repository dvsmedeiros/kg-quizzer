Okay, so I need to create a CSV file with 10 question-answer pairs about the Huguenots based on the provided context and facts. Let me start by reading through the context carefully.

The Huguenots were French Protestants following Calvinism. The term "Huguenote" might come from a Swiss leader, Besançon Hugues. They were mainly in southern and western France and faced conflicts with Catholics leading to the French Wars of Religion from 1562 to 1598. The Edict of Nantes ended these wars by granting them autonomy. Later, under Louis XIV, they suffered persecution, leading many to flee.

Looking at the facts section, there's a lot about images and URLs, but I'll focus on the key points: their origins, conflicts, treaties, and outcomes.

Now, I need to create varied questions covering different aspects like geography, proportions, events, terms, leaders, locations, conspiracies, etc. Each question should have one correct answer based on the context.

Let me outline possible questions:

1. Where were most Huguenots in France?
2. What was their population proportion at a peak?
3. When were the religious wars fought?
4. Which treaty ended those wars?
5. What did the Edict of Nantes grant them?
6. Where did the term "Huguenote" originate?
7. Who was a notable Huguenot leader?
8. What was a key event in 1572?
9. What rebellion happened in the 1620s?
10. What policy ended their rights?

I should ensure each question is unique and covers different areas without overlap.

Double-checking the context for answers:

- Location: southern and central France.
- Proportion: up to 10% before massacres.
- Wars: 1562-1598.
- Treaty: Edict of Nantes.
- Grants autonomy in religion, politics, military.
- Term origin: Besançon Hugues.
- Leaders: Jeanne d'Albret, Henry IV, Condé princes.
- Massacre: St. Bartholomew's Day 1572.
- Rebellion: Amboise Conspiracy 1560.

Wait, the context mentions the Amboise Conspiracy as a 1560 attempt to overthrow Guise. Also, the Edict of Fontainebleau in 1685 revoked their rights.

So I can adjust questions accordingly. Make sure each answer is concise and correct.
