Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the provided context about the French and Indian War. First, I need to read through the context carefully to identify key points that can form relevant questions.

The context mentions the French and Indian War as part of the Seven Years' War, the populations of French and British colonies, the role of Native American tribes, key events like the Battle of Jumonville Glen, the capture of Fort Duquesne, the Battle of the Monongahela, the expulsion of the Acadians, William Pitt's role, and the outcomes like the Treaty of Paris.

I should make sure each question is specific and directly relates to the information given. The answers need to be concise, under 10 words. Let me start listing possible questions:

1. What was the French and Indian War's relation to the Seven Years' War? Answer: It was the American theater of the Seven Years' War.

2. Which tribes supported the British? Answer: Iroquois, Catawba, Cherokee.

3. What event started the conflict? Answer: Battle of Jumonville Glen in 1754.

4. Who led the British forces in the Battle of the Monongahela? Answer: General Edward Braddock.

5. What was the outcome of the British campaign in 1758? Answer: Victory in the Ohio Country.

6. Which treaty ended the war? Answer: Treaty of Paris (1763).

7. What happened to the Acadians? Answer: They were expelled in 1755–64.

8. Who was the British commander-in-chief during the expulsion? Answer: William Shirley.

9. What territories did France cede to Britain? Answer: Canada and territory east of the Mississippi.

10. What was the result of the Montreal Campaign? Answer: French ceded Canada to Britain.

Now, I need to check if these questions cover different aspects of the context and if the answers are accurate and concise. Also, ensure there are no duplicates or overly similar questions. Looks good. Now format them into CSV with semicolons as separators.
