Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs in Portuguese based on the given context about civil disobedience. Let me start by understanding the requirements.

First, the questions should be relevant to the context provided. The context includes definitions, historical examples, key figures, and some triples from DBpedia. The answers need to be short, up to 10 words, and in Portuguese. The format is CSV with semicolons.

Looking at the example provided, the questions vary: some ask for names of movements, others for specific events, people involved, reasons, etc. I need to ensure that each question is unique and covers different aspects of civil disobedience.

From the abstract, key points are: definition, nonviolent aspect, Henry David Thoreau's essay, historical examples like Egyptian Revolution of 1919, Gandhi, Martin Luther King Jr., and the purpose of civil disobedience as a form of nonviolent resistance.

The triples list various events and movements that used civil disobedience. For example, "Assam Movement", "End SARS", "Gwangju Uprising", etc. Also, people like Susan B. Anthony, Saad Zaghloul, and Mahatma Gandhi are mentioned.

I should create questions that ask for these examples, the origin of the term, key figures, purposes, and characteristics. Let me brainstorm possible questions:

1. What is the term for refusing to obey laws as a form of protest? (Answer: desobediência civil)
2. Who popularized the term in the US? (Answer: Henry David Thoreau)
3. Example of a movement in Egypt against British occupation? (Answer: Revolução Egípcia de 1919)
4. Which leader used civil disobedience for Indian independence? (Answer: Mahatma Gandhi)
5. What was the purpose of the Civil Rights Movement in the US? (Answer: direitos civis)
6. What is the nonviolent aspect of civil disobedience called? (Answer: resistência não violenta)
7. Example of a recent protest using civil disobedience? (Answer: End SARS)
8. Who was involved in the women's suffrage movement? (Answer: Susan B. Anthony)
9. What is the main goal of civil disobedience? (Answer: protestar contra leis injustas)
10. Which event is known as the "Revolution of the Roses"? (Answer: Geórgia)

Wait, the example in the user's sample had "Revolution of the Roses" in Georgia. I need to check if that's accurate. The context mentions "Revolution of the Roses" in Georgia, so that's a valid answer.

I need to ensure answers are concise. For example, "Revolution of the Roses" is a specific event, so the answer would be "Revolução das Rosas".

Let me verify each answer against the context and triples. For instance, "Assam Movement" is a triple, so a question about that would be valid.

Now, structuring each pair with the correct format. Avoid repetition. Check for 10 unique questions. Make sure answers are within 10 words. Double-check for any possible errors or overlaps.
