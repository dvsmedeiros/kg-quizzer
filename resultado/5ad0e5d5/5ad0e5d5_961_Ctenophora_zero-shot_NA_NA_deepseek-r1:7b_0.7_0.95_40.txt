Okay, so I need to create 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the given context about ctenophores. First, I'll read through the context carefully to understand what information is available.

I see that ctenophores are comb jellies known for their cilia, which they use for swimming. They range from very small to large sizes and have various body forms like cydippids, platyctenids, and beroids. The context also mentions their prey, which ranges from tiny larvae to small crustaceans, but includes some species that parasitize salps.

There's a lot of scientific details here about their classification, placement in the "tree of life," and some historical findings like fossils from the early Cambrian era. However, I need to create general questions based on this information.

I'll start by identifying key points:
1. Ctenophores are comb jellies.
2. They use cilia for swimming.
3. Size range: small to up to 1.5 meters.
4. Over 100 species validated, some not fully named.
5. Common examples include cydippids with retractable tentacles and colloblasts.
6. Body structure includes jelly with layers of cells.
7. Predators mostly, except for two species that parasitize salps.

Now, I'll formulate questions based on these points:

1. What is the common name for ctenophores?
   - Answer: Comb jellies

2. Do ctenophores swim using cilia?
   - Answer: Yes

3. What's the maximum size of adult ctenophores?
   - Answer: Up to 1.5 meters

4. How many species are validated for ctenophores?
   - Answer: Over 100

5. Which body type is common in ctenophores?
   - Answer: Egg-shaped with tentacles and colloblasts.

6. What's a notable feature of their internal structure?
   - Answer: Jelly with two-cell thick layer on the outside.

7. Do most ctenophores prey on other creatures?
   - Answer: Yes

8. Which group is an exception in terms of parasitizing salps?
   - Answer: Juveniles of two species.

9. What's a recent finding about their classification?
   - Answer: Support for the Ctenophora Sister Hypothesis.

10. Where do fossils of ctenophores date back to?
    - Answer: Early Cambrian (about 525 million years ago)

I think these cover the main points and form straightforward questions with short answers.
