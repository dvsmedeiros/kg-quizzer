2. For each predicate; determine the namespace (ns1 or ns2).
But in the input; the first line is:
Wait; the user's input has two lines with ns2:quantity and ns2:unit. Let me check again.
Therefore; for each line:
- If the predicate is ns1:hypernym; data_type is "hypernym".
- If the predicate is ns2:quantity; data_type is "quantity".
- If the predicate is ns2:unit; data_type is "unit".
Now; the user's input has several lines. Let's go through them one by one.
Next; the other lines in the input are all ns1:hypernym. For example:
3. If it is; add to the CSV with the corresponding data_type.
- Split the line into triples; each separated by semicolons.
- If yes; add to CSV with the corresponding data_type.
But the user's example in the CSV only includes the first part of that line (the ns2:unit); and ignores the others.
      iii. If the predicate is one of the allowed ones; add to the CSV.
Now; the actual parsing of the triples. Each triple is in the form <subject> <predicate> <object> ; 
Then; the other triples in the same line (ns2:wikiPageUsesTemplate and foaf:depiction) are not included.
Now; the rest of the lines in the input are all ns1:hypernym. For example:
