Another point is the chalcogen group. The question could be "Which group is oxygen a member of?" Answer: Chalcogen. Then, the diatomic form is O2, so "What is the diatomic form of oxygen?" Answer: O2. But the example has "Sob condições normais, o que dois átomos de oxigênio formam?;." which translates to "What do two atoms of oxygen form under normal conditions?" Answer: O2.
