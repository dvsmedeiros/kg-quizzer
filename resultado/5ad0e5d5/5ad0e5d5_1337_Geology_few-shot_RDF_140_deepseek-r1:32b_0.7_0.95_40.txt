Okay, I need to figure out how to generate a CSV based on the given instructions and rules. Let me start by understanding what was provided.

The user shared a SPARQL query result in RDF format that lists various entities related to Geology. Each line connects an entity (like people, places, or concepts) to the main subject "Geology" using different predicates such as `wikiPageWikiLink`, `almaMater`, `field`, etc.

The goal is to transform this structured data into a CSV file where each row represents an edge in a graph. Each edge should have three columns: source node, target node, and edge label (the predicate). 

First, I'll parse the RDF data. It looks like each triple is structured as `<subject> <predicate> <object>.`. So for example, `<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Underland_(book)> <dc-terms:subject> <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Geology>.` means "Underland (book)" has a subject of Geology.

Next, I need to extract each triple and map it into the CSV format. The source node will be the entity mentioned first, the target is Geology, and the edge label is the predicate used between them.

I should also consider any namespaces or prefixes. In this case, there are several like `dc-terms`, `dcterms`, `foaf`, etc., but I can use their full URLs as they are since they're already expanded in the RDF data.

Now, looking at the sample CSV provided by the user:

| Source Node              | Target Node       | Edge Label             |
|--------------------------|-------------------|------------------------|
| Underland_(book)          | Geology           | dc-terms:subject       |

This shows that for each line in the RDF data, we extract the source (e.g., "Underland_(book)"), target ("Geology"), and edge label (the predicate).

I need to ensure that all entities are correctly extracted. For instance, some sources might be URLs with underscores or special characters, but since the CSV will handle them as plain text, it should be okay.

Potential issues I might face include handling different namespaces uniformly or ensuring that all predicates are correctly captured. Also, maintaining consistency in how source nodes are named is important to avoid duplicates or mismatches.

I think the best approach is to iterate through each triple, extract the necessary components, and append them as new rows in the CSV. This way, every connection from an entity to Geology is clearly represented with its respective predicate.

Finally, I'll make sure that the headers are correctly labeled as "Source Node", "Target Node", and "Edge Label" for clarity.
