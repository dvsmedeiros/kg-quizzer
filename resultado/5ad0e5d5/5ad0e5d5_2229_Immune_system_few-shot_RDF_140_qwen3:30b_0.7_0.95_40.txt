Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs in Portuguese based on the given context about the immune system. Let me start by understanding the requirements. The questions should be varied, each with a concise answer (up to 10 words). The answers must be inferable from the provided abstract, triples, or examples.

First, I'll go through the abstract to identify key points. The immune system has two major subsystems: innate and adaptive. It detects pathogens, cancer cells, and foreign objects. There's mention of immunological memory, vaccination, autoimmune diseases, immunodeficiency, and specific cells like B cells, T cells, macrophages, etc.

Looking at the triples, there are many entities related to the immune system, like B cells, T cells, macrophages, and conditions like allergies, sepsis, rheumatology. Also, terms like "adaptive immunity" and "innate immunity" are mentioned.

Now, I need to form questions that cover these aspects without repeating. Let's start with the basic structure: the two subsystems. Then move to specific cells, functions, diseases, and mechanisms.

Check the examples provided. They ask about the system's protection, agents detected, parts like the neuroimmune system, differences between subsystems, types of immunity, etc.

I need to ensure each question is unique. For example, one could ask about the two main subsystems, another about the role of B cells, another about autoimmune diseases, etc. Also, include terms from the triples like "defensins" or "complement system" if possible.

Make sure answers are short. For instance, "sistema imunológico inato e adaptativo" for the two subsystems. Check if the answers are in the context. The abstract mentions "innate immune system" and "adaptive immune system," so that's covered.

Another point: the immune system's ability to create memory, which is the basis of vaccination. So a question could be about the basis of vaccination, answer "memória imunológica."

Also, mention specific cells like T cells or B cells, and their roles. For example, "Quais células são responsáveis pela imunidade humoral?" Answer: "células B."

Check for possible answers in the triples. For example, "defensinas" are mentioned in the abstract as antimicrobial peptides. So a question could be "Quais são os peptídeos antimicrobianos produzidos pelo sistema imunológico?" Answer: "defensinas."

Avoid repeating similar questions. Ensure each pair is distinct. Also, check that answers are within 10 words. For example, "doenças autoimunes" is short enough.

Now, compiling 10 pairs. Let me list them:

1. Two main subsystems: innate and adaptive.
2. Cells involved in adaptive immunity: B and T cells.
3. What is the basis of vaccination? Immunological memory.
4. Autoimmune diseases example: rheumatoid arthritis.
5. What causes immunodeficiency? Weakened immune system.
6. Pathogens detected by the immune system: viruses, bacteria, etc.
7. Function of the complement system: part of innate immunity.
8. What is the role of macrophages? Phagocytosis.
9. Example of a condition caused by immune dysfunction: sepsis.
10. What are the two types of immunity? Innate and adaptive.

Wait, need to check if these are all covered in the context. The abstract mentions "innate" and "adaptive," so that's good. The triples list B and T cells. Autoimmune examples like rheumatoid arthritis are in the context. Immunodeficiency causes are mentioned. Pathogens include viruses, parasites, etc. Complement system is part of innate. Macrophages are in the triples. Sepsis is a medical cause. Two types of immunity are mentioned.

Now, translate these into Portuguese, ensuring the answers are concise. Also, check for any possible errors. For example, "sistema imunológico inato e adaptativo" is correct. "Células B e T" for B and T cells. "Memória imunológica" for vaccination basis. "Artrite reumatoide" as an example. "Sistema imunológico enfraquecido" for immunodeficiency. "Vírus, bactérias, parasitas" for pathogens. "Sistema complemento" as part of innate. "Fagocitose" for macrophages. "Sepsis" as a condition. "Imunidade inata e adaptativa" for the two types.

Now, format them as CSV with semicolons. Ensure no markdown, just the CSV. Check for 10 lines. Avoid any repetition. Make sure answers are within 10 words. Looks good.
