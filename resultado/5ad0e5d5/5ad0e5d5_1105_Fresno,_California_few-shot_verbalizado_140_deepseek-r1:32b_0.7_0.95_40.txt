Okay, I need to create a quiz with 10 question-answer pairs in Portuguese based on the given context about Fresno, California. Let me start by carefully reading through the abstract and the facts provided.

First, the abstract tells me that Fresno is a major city in the San Joaquin Valley, it's the fifth-largest city in California, has a population of over half a million, was founded as a railway station in 1872, became incorporated in 1885, and is known for its agricultural economy. It also mentions the geographical location relative to other cities like Los Angeles and Sacramento.

Looking at the facts, there are many specific details about Fresno. For instance, it's mentioned that Fresno has a significant Hispanic population, around 50.5% as of 2020. There are several individuals born in Fresno, such as Jamila Reinhardt and Nathan Riech. The city also hosts various sports teams and events, like the Pac-12 Conference football season.

I need to generate varied questions that cover different aspects of Fresno's history, population, geographical features, economy, notable people, and cultural significance. Each question should have a single correct answer derived from the provided information.

Let me brainstorm some potential topics for each question:

1. Founding year as a railway station.
2. Incorporation year.
3. Nickname or origin of its name.
4. Population rank in California.
5. Main economic activity.
6. Percentage of Hispanic population.
7. Nearby national parks (Yosemite, Kings Canyon, Sequoia).
8. Water challenges due to droughts.
9. Notable people born there (e.g., Jamila Reinhardt).
10. Surrounding areas' main industry.

I should ensure each question is unique and covers a different aspect without repetition. Also, the answers need to be concise, within 10 words, and in Portuguese.

Now, I'll draft each pair:

1. When was Fresno founded as a railway station? Answer: 1872.
2. When did it become an incorporated city? 1885.
3. What does "Fresno" mean? Ash tree.
4. Rank among the most populous cities in California? 5th.
5. Main economic activity? Agriculture.
6. Hispanic population percentage? 50.5%.
7. Which parks are nearby? Yosemite, Kings Canyon, Sequoia.
8. What issue affects Fresno due to droughts? Water security.
9. Name a notable person born in Fresno. Jamila Reinhardt.
10. Main industry in surrounding areas? Agriculture.

I should check if each answer is correctly inferred from the context and that there are no repetitions. Also, ensure Portuguese accuracy for terms like "agricultura" and proper names.

Finally, I'll format them as CSV with semicolons separating questions and answers.
