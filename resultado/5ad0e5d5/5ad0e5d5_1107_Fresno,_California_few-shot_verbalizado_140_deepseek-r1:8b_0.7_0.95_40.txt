Ok, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the provided context and facts. Let me start by understanding the structure required: each line should be a question followed by a correct answer, separated by a semicolon.

First, I'll review the context about Fresno. It's a city in California, founded in 1872 as a railway station. Incorporated in 1885. The population and some geographical details are given. Also, it's near major parks like Yosemite and Kings Canyon.

Looking at the facts, there are mentions of various teams from different years that have connections to Fresno, such as the Pac-12 Conference in 2015, Jamila Reinhardt's birthplace, and others. There are also details about media stations, events happening there, and some demographic info like the Hispanic population.

I need to create questions that are relevant but not repetitive. They should cover different aspects: geography, history, demography, sports connections, cultural references, etc.

Let me brainstorm possible questions:

1. Year of foundation.
2. Current status as a city.
3. Major parks nearby.
4. Population rank in California.
5. Nickname or significance related to the ash trees.
6. Nearby airports.
7. Incorporation year.
8. Hispanic population percentage.
9. Events hosted, like Bellator MMA in 2015.
10. Land area in square miles.

Now, I'll structure each as a question and find the correct answer from the context. For example, the foundation year is 1872, so the question could be about when Fresno was founded. The response would be "1872."

I need to ensure that the answers are accurate and directly extractable from the given data without adding external knowledge.

Let me check each point against the facts provided:

- Foundation: 1872 as a railway station.
- Incorporated: 1885.
- Parks nearby: Yosemite, Kings Canyon, Sequoia.
- Population rank: 34th in the nation.
- Ash trees: Named for them, so "freixo" in Portuguese.
- Hispanic population: 50.5% in 2020.
- Events: Bellator MMA in 2016 and others listed.
- Land area: 300.43 km².

I should phrase each question to be clear and directly related to the context without being too vague. Also, ensure that the Portuguese used is correct for the responses.

Now, I'll list them out as per the CSV format with semicolon separators.
