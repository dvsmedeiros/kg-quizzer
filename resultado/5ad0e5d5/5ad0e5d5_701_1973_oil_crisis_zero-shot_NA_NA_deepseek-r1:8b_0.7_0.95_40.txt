Okay, so I have to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the given context about the 1973 oil crisis. The questions should be relevant and the answers correct and concise, each pair separated by a semicolon.

First, I need to understand the context thoroughly. The oil crisis started in October 1973 when OAPEC countries, led by Saudi Arabia, imposed an oil embargo on nations supporting Israel during the Yom Kippur War. Initially targeted countries include Canada, Japan, Netherlands, UK, and US, later extended to Portugal, Rhodesia, and South Africa. By March 1974, oil prices had nearly tripled, causing significant economic impacts.

Now, I should think of questions that cover various aspects: who was involved, the main event, targets, consequences, etc. Each question must be distinct but related to the context.

1. Who led the OAPEC countries in declaring the embargo?
   Answer: Saudi Arabia.

2. What countries were initially targeted by the embargo?
   Answer: Canada, Japan, Netherlands, UK, US.

3. Which conflict led to the oil embargo?
   Answer: Yom Kippur War.

4. What was the name of the first oil shock caused by this crisis?
   Answer: First Oil Shock.

5. How much did global oil prices increase by March 1974?
   Answer: Nearly 300%.

6. Which countries were included in the later extension of the embargo?
   Answer: Portugal, Rhodesia, South Africa.

7. What was a significant short-term effect of the crisis?
   Answer: Oil price spikes leading to economic challenges.

8. Which term is used to describe the period after the first oil shock?
   Answer: Second oil shock (1979).

9. What was the main reason for the embargo?
   Answer: Support for Israel during Yom Kippur War.

10. How did the crisis affect global politics and economy?
    Answer: It caused significant changes in global dynamics and economic stability.

I need to make sure each question is clear, directly related to the context, and the answers are accurate and concise. Also, ensuring that all 10 pairs are created without repetition in topics.
