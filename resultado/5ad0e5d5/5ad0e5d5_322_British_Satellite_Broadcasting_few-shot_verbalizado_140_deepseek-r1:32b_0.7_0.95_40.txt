Okay, so I need to generate a quiz based on the information provided about British Satellite Broadcasting (BSB). Let me start by understanding the context.

From the abstract, BSB was a TV company in London that started broadcasting in March 1990 and merged with Sky Television in November 1990 to form BSkyB. The facts include details like its founding date, location, services, ownership of various channels, and related categories.

I should create 10 varied questions covering different aspects: when it was founded, where it was based, key events like the merger, what channels it owned, its status as a company, etc. Each question needs to have a clear, concise answer that's directly supported by the information given.

Let me go through each fact and think of potential questions:

1. Founded on December 11, 1986: "When was BSB founded?" Answer: December 11, 1986.
2. Headquartered in London: "Where was BSB based?"
3. Started broadcasting March 25, 1990: "When did BSB start broadcasting?"
4. Merged with Sky Television on November 2, 1990: "When did BSB merge with Sky Television?"
5. Channels like The Computer Channel, Now, Galaxy: "Which channel was owned by BSB?" (Pick one)
6. Status as a company: "What type of entity is BSB?" Answer: Company.
7. Categories it falls into: "Under which category does BSB fall?" Could be mass media companies or British companies.
8. Disbanded in 1990 after merger: "When did BSB cease to exist?" Or ask about its dissolution year.
9. Own channels like The Power Station, The Movie Channel: Another ownership question.
10. Services provided: Direct broadcast satellite TV.

I should ensure each question is unique and covers different aspects without repeating similar points. Also, the answers must be short, up to 10 words.

Let me structure them:

1. When was BSB founded?
2. Where was BSB based?
3. When did BSB start broadcasting?
4. Which company succeeded BSB?
5. Name a TV channel owned by BSB.
6. What type of entity is BSB?
7. Under which category does BSB fall?
8. In which year was BSB disbanded?
9. Which film was produced by BSB?
10. What services did BSB provide?

Wait, for question 5, I should pick a specific channel like The Computer Channel to make it precise. Similarly, for question 7, specifying "British companies" makes it clearer.

I need to ensure that the answers are directly from the facts and don't require external knowledge. Each answer should be one of the facts listed, like December 1986, London, March 25, 1990, etc.

Now, putting them all together in the CSV format with semicolons separating each question and answer.
