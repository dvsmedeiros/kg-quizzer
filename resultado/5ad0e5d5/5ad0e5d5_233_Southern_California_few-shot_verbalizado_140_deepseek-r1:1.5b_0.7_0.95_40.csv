First, each row in the CSV should have "pergunta;resposta". The questions must be relevant to the provided content. I'll look for keywords related to Southern California, like state, region, population, etc.
I should format these into a CSV with the correct separators and structure. Each row starts with "pergunta;resposta", followed by ten rows of questions and answers.
