Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the provided context about the Normans. The answers need to be concise, under 10 words, and in Portuguese. 

First, I'll read through the context to understand the key points. The Normans were a mix of Norse Vikings and Frankish people in Normandy. They conquered places like England and Sicily. Important events include the Treaty of Saint-Clair-sur-Epte, the Battle of Hastings, and the eventual loss of mainland Normandy to France. Their language evolved into Norman French, and they had a significant cultural impact.

Now, I need to come up with varied questions. Let's start with the origin. The first example question is about where Normandy is located. The answer is France. That's straightforward. Next, when did the Normans establish their identity? The text mentions the first half of the 10th century. 

Then, the countries the Norse originated from. The example mentions Denmark, Iceland, and Norway. But the context says they came from Denmark, Norway, and Sweden. Wait, the example answer might have a typo. The user's example response for "De quais países os nórdicos se originaram?" is "Dinamarca, Islândia e Noruega". But according to the context, it's Denmark, Norway, and Sweden. Hmm, but maybe the user's example is correct. I need to check the context again. The context says "Norse settlements in West Francia followed a series of raids on the French northern coast mainly from Denmark, although some also sailed from Norway and Sweden." So the answer should include Denmark, Norway, and Sweden. But the example given by the user has Iceland. Maybe the user's example is incorrect, but I should stick to the context. However, the user might have specific answers in mind. Wait, the user's example is part of the instruction, so maybe I should follow that. But the actual context doesn't mention Iceland. So maybe the user's example is wrong. But I have to generate based on the context given. So for "De quais países os nórdicos se originaram?", the answer should be "Dinamarca, Noruega e Suécia". But the user's example answer is different. Hmm, but the user's example might be a mistake. I need to ensure accuracy based on the context provided. 

Next, the language of the Normans. The context mentions Old Norse, Latin, and Old Norman. So a question about their languages. 

The Battle of Hastings is a key event. The answer would be 1066. 

The Treaty of Saint-Clair-sur-Epte is when the Normans were given land by the French king. So the answer is 911. 

The loss of mainland Normandy to France happened in 1204. 

The architectural style is Norman, so a question about that. 

The Norman French language evolved from Old Norman. 

The religious beliefs: they practiced Christianity and Norse paganism. 

The cultural impact: they influenced architecture and language. 

Wait, need to make sure each answer is under 10 words. Let me check each one. 

For example, "Quando os normandos estabeleceram sua identidade?" Answer: "No primeiro semestre do século X." (First half of the 10th century). That's 7 words. 

"De onde vieram os nórdicos?" Answer: "Dinamarca, Noruega e Suécia." 

"Qual era a língua dos normandos?" Answer: "Latim, Norueguês Antigo e Normando Antigo." 

"Quando ocorreu a Batalha de Hastings?" Answer: "Em 1066." 

"Quando foi assinado o Tratado de Saint-Clair-sur-Epte?" Answer: "Em 911." 

"Quando a Normandia continental foi perdida para a França?" Answer: "Em 1204." 

"Qual estilo arquitetônico os normandos influenciaram?" Answer: "Estilo Normando." 

"Qual língua evoluiu do normando antigo?" Answer: "O francês normando." 

"Quais religiões os normandos praticavam?" Answer: "Cristianismo e paganismo nórdico." 

"Como os normandos influenciaram a cultura?" Answer: "Arquitetura e língua." 

I think these cover the key points. Let me check if all answers are under 10 words and accurate based on the context. Also, ensure that the questions are in Portuguese and the answers are concise.
