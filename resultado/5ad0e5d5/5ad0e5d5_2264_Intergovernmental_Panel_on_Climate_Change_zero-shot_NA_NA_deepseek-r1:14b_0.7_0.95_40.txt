Okay, so I need to create a CSV file with 10 question-answer pairs based on the provided context about the IPCC. The questions should be relevant and each answer should be concise, up to 10 words. The language is Portuguese, and the separator is a semicolon.

First, I'll read through the context carefully to identify key points that can form good quiz questions. Let me list out the main facts:

- IPCC was established in 1988 by WMO and UNEP.
- It's an intergovernmental body under the UN with 195 member states.
- The secretariat is hosted by WMO in Geneva, Switzerland.
- They produce Assessment Reports every 6-7 years; the latest cycle started in 2015 and will end in 2023.
- There are three working groups: I (physical science), II (impacts/adaptation), III (mitigation).
- The IPCC doesn't do original research but reviews existing literature.
- They received the Nobel Peace Prize in 2007 alongside Al Gore.
- Recent reports include AR6, Special Reports like 1.5°C, Climate Change and Land, Ocean and Cryosphere.

Now, I need to frame questions that target these points. Each question should be clear and direct, prompting for a short answer. Let me think of possible questions:

1. When was the IPCC established? (1988)
2. Which organizations created the IPCC? (WMO and UNEP)
3. What's the purpose of the IPCC? (Advance knowledge on human-induced climate change)
4. Where is the IPCC's secretariat located? (Geneva, Switzerland)
5. How many member states does the IPCC have? (195)
6. What are the three working groups named? (I, II, III or specific areas)
7. What does the IPCC produce every assessment cycle? (Assessment Reports)
8. What year did the IPCC win the Nobel Peace Prize? (2007)
9. What's the name of the current assessment cycle? (Sixth Assessment Cycle)
10. What was a major report from AR6? (Working Group I, II, III reports)

Wait, I should make sure each answer is concise and within 10 words. Let me adjust where necessary.

For example, question 3 could be rephrased to avoid the long explanation of "Advance scientific knowledge about climate change caused by human activities." Maybe something like "What is the primary objective of the IPCC?"

Alternatively, perhaps more precise: "O que é a principal finalidade do IPCC?" with answer "Avançar o conhecimento científico sobre mudança climática causada pelo homem."

Similarly, for question 6, instead of listing all three working groups, maybe ask about one specific aspect, like what group deals with physical science.

Wait, the user's example shows that some questions are in Portuguese and others in English. But according to instructions, everything should be in Portuguese. So I need to make sure both the questions and answers are in Portuguese.

I think my initial list is a good start. Now, let me structure each line properly with semicolons and ensure all answers fit within 10 words.
