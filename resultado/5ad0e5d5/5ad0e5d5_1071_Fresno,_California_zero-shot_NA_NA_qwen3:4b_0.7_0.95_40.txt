Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the provided context about Fresno. First, I need to make sure I understand the context thoroughly. The key points are: Fresno is a major city in California's San Joaquin Valley, the county seat, population stats, location, historical background, nearby national parks, and demographic info.

Now, I need to generate 10 relevant questions. Each question should be concise, and the answer must be a short phrase (up to 10 words). Let me brainstorm possible questions. 

Starting with the name: "What is the name of the city in California's San Joaquin Valley?" Answer would be Fresno. Next, the county seat: "What is the county seat of Fresno County?" Answer: Fresno. 

Population-related questions: "What was the 2020 population of Fresno?" Answer: 542,107. "What is the metro population of Fresno as of 2022?" Answer: 1,008,654.

Location details: "Where is Fresno located in California?" Answer: San Joaquin Valley. "How far is Fresno from Los Angeles?" Answer: 220 miles. "What is the approximate distance from Fresno to Sacramento?" Answer: 170 miles.

Historical info: "When was Fresno founded?" Answer: 1872. "What was Fresno's original purpose?" Answer: Railway station. 

Nearby parks: "Which national park is 60 miles north of Fresno?" Answer: Yosemite. "Which park is 75 miles southeast of Fresno?" Answer: Sequoia. 

Demographics: "What percentage of Fresno's population is Hispanic as of 2020?" Answer: 50.5%. "What is the significance of Fresno's population in California?" Answer: Fifth-most populous city.

Wait, that's 10. Let me check if each answer is within 10 words. Yes. Also, ensure that the questions are all based on the context provided. Avoid any information not in the text. For example, the answer about the droughts is not needed here. Also, check that the answers are accurate according to the given data. 

Make sure the CSV format is correct, with each line as "question;answer". No extra text, just the CSV. Also, confirm that the answers are concise. For example, "third-largest majority-Hispanic city" is part of the answer, but the answer should be short. The user's example has answers like "50.5% of its population was Hispanic" which is exactly 10 words. So, need to keep answers within that limit. 

Double-check each question and answer against the context to ensure accuracy. For example, the distance to San Francisco is 185 miles, but the user's example didn't include that. Maybe include that as another question. Wait, the user's example didn't have that, so maybe not. Let me stick to the 10 I have. 

Yes, that should cover it. Now, format them correctly in CSV.
