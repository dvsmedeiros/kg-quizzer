Ok, I need to help create 10 question-answer pairs based on the provided context about computational complexity theory. The questions should be relevant and the answers correct with up to 10 words each.

First, I'll read through the context carefully to identify key points. It mentions that computational complexity theory classifies problems by their resource usage, relates these classes, and uses models like time, storage, communication, etc. It also talks about the role in determining computer limits, including the P vs NP problem, and distinguishes it from analysis of algorithms and computability theory.

I'll start by identifying main concepts: computational complexity theory, resource usage, classification, models (time, storage), P vs NP, relation to other fields (analysis of algorithms, computability theory).

Now, I can think of 10 relevant questions:

1. What does computational complexity theory focus on?
2. What is a computational problem?
3. How is difficulty determined in computational problems?
4. What mathematical models are used in computational complexity?
5. Which measures quantify resource usage?
6. What role does the theory play in determining computer capabilities?
7. What is the P vs NP problem related to?
8. How do computational complexity and computability theory differ?
9. What distinguishes computational complexity from analysis of algorithms?

Wait, I need 10. Hmm, maybe add another about communication complexity or circuit complexity.

Alternatively, perhaps focusing on specific aspects: time and storage, as per the context.

Let me ensure each question is clear and directly relates to the context. I should also keep answers concise, using terms from the text.

Now, constructing each pair:

1. computational complexity theory; study of resource usage in problems
2. computational problem; task solved by computer algorithm
3. difficulty; requires significant resources for solution
4. models of computation; used in studying complexity
5. time, storage; measures in complexity (ex: 6)
6. computer capabilities; formalizes limits of what computers can do
7. P vs NP; related to field (7th Millennium Problem)
8. computability theory; difference is restriction on resources
9. analysis of algorithms; focuses on specific algorithms' resource use
10. computational complexity; general question about all possible algorithms

I think these are accurate and fit the context provided.
