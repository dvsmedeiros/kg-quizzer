Ok, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs in Portuguese based on the provided context about the Black Death. Let me start by understanding what's required.

First, each pair should be a relevant question related to the context and a correct short answer. The format is "pergunta;resposta" separated by a semicolon. I need to ensure variety in the questions and that the answers are directly inferable from the context.

Looking at the context, there's information about the origin of the Black Death, its spread, death tolls, effects on society, and scientific discoveries related to it. I should cover different aspects to keep the questions varied.

I'll start by identifying key points:
- Origin: Central Asia or East Asia?
- Spread via which vectors (fleas, rats)?
- Dates: when did it peak in Europe? When did it end?
- Effects: population impact, economic effects.
- Scientific findings: recent discoveries about origins.

Now, I need to frame these points into questions. Let's make sure each question is clear and directly relates to the context without being repetitive.

1. Origin question: Where did the Black Death likely originate? Answer: Central Asia.
2. Spread vector: How did it spread beyond Crimea? Answer: via Genoese ships carrying rats.
3. Peak in Europe: When did the Black Death peak in Europe? April 1347.
4. Effects on population: What was the death toll? 75-200 million.
5. Economic impact: How did it affect trade and labor? Reduced labor, inflation.
6. Person-to-person spread: How did the plague spread once ashore? Through aerosols causing pneumonic form.
7. Recovery time: When did Europe regain pre-death population levels? By 1500.
8. Last major outbreak: Where was the last significant outbreak in Europe? London by 1665.
9. Scientific discovery: What recent finding changed origin theories? Surges in Kyrgyzstan deaths, suggesting earlier spread.
10. Enzootic vs pandemic: What's the difference between enzootic and pandemic? Enzootic is present in animals; pandemic affects humans.

I should ensure each answer is concise, up to 10 words, and directly from the context. Let me check for accuracy, especially regarding dates and specific effects.
