Okay, the user wants me to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the provided context about the Huguenots. Let me start by understanding the context thoroughly.

First, the Huguenots were French Protestants following Calvinism. The term might come from a Swiss leader, Hugues Bezanson. They faced persecution, especially under Louis XIV with the Edict of Fontainebleau in 1685, which revoked their rights. The Edict of Nantes initially gave them autonomy, but later they lost political rights. The French Wars of Religion were a series of conflicts from 1562 to 1598. Key figures like Jeanne d'Albret and Henry IV (who converted) were leaders. The dragonnades were a method of forced conversion. The population decline was significant, and many fled, causing a brain drain. Persecution ended with the Edict of Versailles in 1787 and the Declaration of 1789.

Now, I need to create 10 questions. Each should be relevant and the answer concise. Let me brainstorm possible questions:

1. What was the origin of the term "Huguenots"? Answer: Possibly from Hugues Bezanson.
2. Which religious tradition did they follow? Answer: Reformed, Calvinist.
3. When was the Edict of Fontainebleau issued? Answer: 1685.
4. Who led the Huguenots during the French Wars of Religion? Answer: Jeanne d'Albret, Henry IV, princes of Condé.
5. What was the Edict of Nantes? Answer: Granted autonomy to Huguenots.
6. What were the dragonnades? Answer: Forced conversion by soldiers.
7. When did persecution end? Answer: 1787 with Edict of Versailles.
8. What was the population decline? Answer: From 900,000 to 1,000-1,500.
9. Which conflict ended the French Wars of Religion? Answer: Edict of Nantes.
10. What was the main reason for the Huguenot exodus? Answer: Persecution and forced conversion.

I need to check the answers are within 10 words. For example, "Edict of Fontainebleau" is concise. Also, ensure the questions are clear and the answers are accurate based on the context. Avoid any markdown and use semicolons as separators. Let me format them as CSV.
