Okay, so I need to create a quiz with 10 question-answer pairs based on the provided context about Islamism. Let me start by understanding what's given.

First, the context explains that Islamism is a political ideology aiming to reconstitute states according to Islamic principles. It mentions different strategies like revolutionary or reformist approaches and key figures such as Sayyid Qutb and Hassan al-Banna. The context also notes that some groups use peaceful means while others resort to violence.

Looking at the facts, there are numerous organizations listed with Islamism as their ideology, including Muslim Brotherhood, Hizb ut-Tahrir, and Hamas. There's also mention of specific events or notable individuals associated with these movements.

I need to generate varied questions that cover different aspects: definitions, key figures, strategies, related groups, and impacts. Each question should have a clear, concise answer based on the context or facts provided.

Let me brainstorm some potential questions:

1. What is Islamism?
2. Who are prominent figures in Islamism?
3. What do Islamist groups aim to achieve?
4. Which strategy does the Muslim Brotherhood use?
5. How did the Arab Spring affect Islamism?
6. What's the goal of Hamas?
7. What does Hizb ut-Tahrir advocate for?
8. Can Islamists support democracy?
9. Which countries have significant Islamist movements?
10. What was Sayyid Qutb's stance on violence?

Now, I'll check if each answer is supported by the context or facts.

For example:
- The definition of Islamism as a political ideology aiming to reconstitute states according to Islamic principles.
- Mentioning Hassan al-Banna and Sayyid Qutb as key figures.
- Strategies like peaceful political processes versus revolutionary means.
- Hamas being associated with Palestine.
- Hizb ut-Tahrir advocating for an Islamic state.

I'll make sure each answer is accurate and concise, fitting within the 10-word limit. Also, I need to ensure there's no repetition in questions and that they cover a broad range of topics related to Islamism.
