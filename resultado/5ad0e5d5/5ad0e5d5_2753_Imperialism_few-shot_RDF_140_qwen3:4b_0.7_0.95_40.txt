Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the provided context and facts. Let me start by understanding the context. The user provided a definition of imperialism, which is about extending power and dominion through territorial acquisition or political/economic control. There are also some triples and examples that mention things like colonialism, empire, and different forms of expansion.

First, I should make sure the questions are varied and cover different aspects of imperialism. The answer must be concise, up to 10 words. Let me go through the facts given. There are mentions of different political parties associated with imperialism, historical events like the Herero and Namaqua genocide, Japanese war crimes, and the Portuguese Angola era. Also, there's a mention of the Canadian Conservative Party and the Progressive Party of Cape Colony having imperialism as their ideology.

I need to create questions that relate to these elements. For example, a question about the primary motive of certain events, the ideology of political parties, or the types of imperialisms. Also, the user's example includes terms like "formal" and "informal" imperialism, so that's a key point to include.

Let me brainstorm possible questions:

1. What is the primary motive of the Herero and Namaqua genocide?
2. Which political party in Canada had imperialism as its ideology?
3. What is the term for imperialisms that use economic and military power?
4. What is the term for imperialisms that don't use direct control?
5. What is an example of formal imperialism?
6. What is the main focus of the book "Culture and Imperialism"?
7. What is the main theme of the article "Faultline 49"?
8. What is the main subject of the Wikipedia page on imperialism?
9. What is the term for the expansion of a country's power through territories?
10. What is the main difference between formal and informal imperialism?

Now, I need to check if these questions are based on the provided context and facts. The Herero and Namaqua genocide is mentioned with motive as imperialism, so that's correct. The Canadian Conservative Party is listed as having imperialism as ideology. The term "hard power" is mentioned in the context as part of imperialism. The example of Portuguese Angola is under the era of imperialism. The book "Culture and Imperialism" is mentioned as a non-fiction subject. The article "Faultline 49" is also listed under non-fiction subjects. The Wikipedia page on imperialism is linked. The expansion through territories is part of the definition. Formal vs. informal is a distinction made in the context.

I need to ensure each answer is a short phrase, up to 10 words. Also, check for repetition and variety. Let me verify each question and answer against the facts. For example, the answer to the first question should be "imperialism" as per the fact. The second question's answer is "Canadian Conservative Party". The third answer is "hard power". The fourth answer is "informal imperialism". The fifth example is "Portuguese Angola". The sixth answer is "imperialism". The seventh answer is "imperialism". The eighth answer is "imperialism". The ninth answer is "territorial acquisition". The tenth answer is "direct control".

Wait, the tenth question is about the difference between formal and informal. The context says that informal is less direct. So the answer should be "less direct" or "indirect". Let me check the example given in the user's sample. The user's example has "O imperialismo informal ainda é dominante; no entanto, menos o que?;direto;" which translates to "Informal imperialism is still dominant; however, less the what?;direct;". So the answer is "direct". So the answer here would be "less direct" or "indirect".

I need to make sure all answers are accurate and concise. Now, compiling all these into the CSV format with the correct separators. Also, check for any possible duplicates or similar questions. Once that's done, the output should be 10 lines in the specified format.
