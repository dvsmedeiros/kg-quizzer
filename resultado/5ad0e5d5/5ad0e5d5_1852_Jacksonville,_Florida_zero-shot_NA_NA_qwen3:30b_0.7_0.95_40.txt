Okay, the user wants me to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the given context about Jacksonville. Let me start by reading through the context carefully to extract key facts.

First, I need to identify the main points. The context mentions that Jacksonville is the most populous city in Florida, the largest by area in the contiguous US as of 2020. It's the seat of Duval County, consolidated in 1968. Population numbers are there: 949,611 as of 2020, making it 12th most populous in the US. The metropolitan area population is 1,733,937, fourth-largest in Florida. Location details: on the Atlantic coast, northeast Florida, St. Johns River, near Georgia and Miami. Historical info: French colony of Fort Caroline in 1564, named after Andrew Jackson. Military bases and ports are significant. Economy includes services, tourism, especially golf. Residents are called "Jacksonvillians" or "Jaxsons".

Now, I need to turn these into questions. Each question should be relevant, and the answer should be concise, under 10 words. Let me brainstorm possible questions:

1. What is the population of Jacksonville as of 2020? Answer: 949,611.
2. What is the largest city by area in the contiguous US? Answer: Jacksonville.
3. When was Jacksonville consolidated with Duval County? Answer: 1968.
4. What river does Jacksonville straddle? Answer: St. Johns River.
5. What was the French colony in Jacksonville called? Answer: Fort Caroline.
6. Who is Jacksonville named after? Answer: Andrew Jackson.
7. What is the population of the Jacksonville metropolitan area? Answer: 1,733,937.
8. What is Jacksonville's main port? Answer: Port of Jacksonville.
9. What is the primary economic sector in Jacksonville? Answer: Services.
10. What are residents of Jacksonville called? Answer: Jacksonvillians or Jaxsons.

I need to check that each answer is under 10 words. Let me count:

1. 3 words: 949,611.
2. 5 words: Jacksonville.
3. 5 words: 1968.
4. 4 words: St. Johns River.
5. 3 words: Fort Caroline.
6. 3 words: Andrew Jackson.
7. 5 words: 1,733,937.
8. 4 words: Port of Jacksonville.
9. 4 words: Services.
10. 4 words: Jacksonvillians or Jaxsons.

All answers are within the limit. Now, format them as CSV with semicolons. Make sure there's no extra text, just the CSV. Let me double-check the context for accuracy. For example, the population numbers and the name of the port. The answer for the port is correct as per the context. The economy part mentions services like banking, insurance, etc., so "services" is accurate. The residents' nickname is correctly noted. Okay, this should meet the user's requirements.
