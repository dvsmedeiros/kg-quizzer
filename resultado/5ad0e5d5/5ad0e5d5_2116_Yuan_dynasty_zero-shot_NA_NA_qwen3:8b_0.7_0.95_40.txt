Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the provided context about the Yuan dynasty. Let me start by understanding the context thoroughly.

First, the Yuan dynasty was established by Kublai Khan, a Mongol leader, and lasted from 1271 to 1368. It was a Mongol-led dynasty that succeeded the Mongol Empire and preceded the Ming dynasty. The key points include Kublai's role, the establishment year, the end of the dynasty, the defeat by the Ming, the retreat to Mongolia, the use of Chinese and Mongolian languages, the Mandate of Heaven, and the claim of succession from previous dynasties.

Now, I need to create 10 relevant questions. Let me brainstorm possible questions:

1. Who founded the Yuan dynasty?
2. When was the Yuan dynasty established?
3. What was the duration of the Yuan dynasty?
4. Which dynasty followed the Yuan dynasty?
5. What language did some Yuan emperors master?
6. What was the name of the dynasty proclaimed in 1271?
7. What title did Kublai Khan claim besides Emperor of China?
8. Which dynasty defeated the Yuan dynasty?
9. What is the term for the rump state after the Yuan's retreat?
10. What script did some Yuan emperors use besides Mongolian?

Wait, let me check if these questions are accurate based on the context. The context mentions Kublai established it, so question 1 is correct. Established in 1271, so question 2 is okay. The dynasty lasted until 1368, so question 3 should be 1271-1368. The Ming dynasty followed, so question 4 is correct. Some emperors mastered Chinese, so question 5 is good. The name proclaimed was Great Yuan, so question 6 is correct. Kublai claimed Great Khan, so question 7 is right. The Ming defeated them, so question 8 is correct. The rump state is Northern Yuan, so question 9 is correct. The Phags-pa script was used, so question 10 is okay.

Now, I need to ensure the answers are concise, up to 10 words. Let me verify each answer:

1. Kublai Khan; answer is correct.
2. 1271; answer is correct.
3. 1271 to 1368; that's 10 words.
4. Ming dynasty; correct.
5. Chinese language; correct.
6. Great Yuan; correct.
7. Great Khan; correct.
8. Ming dynasty; correct.
9. Northern Yuan dynasty; correct.
10. Phags-pa script; correct.

Wait, the 10th question: the context says "some of the Yuan emperors mastered the Chinese language, while others only used their native Mongolian language and the 'Phags-pa script." So the answer for question 10 should be "Phags-pa script" as one of the scripts used. So the answer is correct.

Now, arrange them in CSV format, ensuring the separator is semicolon. Each line should be "pergunta;resposta". Let me double-check the answers for accuracy and conciseness. All seem correct. Now, format them into the CSV as specified.
