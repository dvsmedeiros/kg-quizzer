Okay; I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs in Portuguese based on the given context about the Scottish Parliament. Let me start by understanding the context thoroughly.
But I have to make sure not to use any facts that aren't in the context. The context mentions "Edinburgh; Scotland" as the location. So maybe include that as a question.
I think this should meet the requirements. Now; format them into CSV.
"Quais Ã¡reas o Parlamento pode legislar?" "Todas; exceto as reservadas."
