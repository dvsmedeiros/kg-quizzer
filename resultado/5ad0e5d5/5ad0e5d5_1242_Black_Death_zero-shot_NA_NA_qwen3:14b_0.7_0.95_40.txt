Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to generate 10 question-answer pairs in Portuguese based on the provided context about the Black Death. First, I need to understand the context thoroughly. The Black Death was a bubonic plague pandemic from 1346 to 1353, causing massive deaths. It's caused by Yersinia pestis, spread by fleas and person-to-person. The origin is disputed, possibly Central or East Asia, spread via Genoese ships. There's a mention of a surge in Kyrgyzstan in the late 1330s, and the impact on Europe's population.

Now, I need to create relevant questions. Let me start by identifying key points: dates, causes, spread, effects, origin, and the recent genetic evidence. Each question should target a specific piece of information. For example, the time frame, the bacterium, the spread routes, the percentage of deaths, the origin theories, the role of rats, the impact on population, the 2022 discovery, the other natural disaster before it, and the recurrence until the 19th century.

I need to make sure the answers are concise, up to 10 words. Also, check for any possible errors, like mixing up the dates or the causes. Let me verify each point against the context again. For example, the Black Death started in 1346, the bacterium is Yersinia pestis, spread by fleas and aerosols. The origin is Central or East Asia, then Crimea. The 2022 study found deaths in Kyrgyzstan, challenging the Mongol conquest theory. The population decline was 30-60% in Europe. The Great Famine was the first disaster. Recurrence until 19th century.

Now, phrasing each question in Portuguese, making sure they are clear and directly related to the context. Avoid vague questions. Then, ensure the answers are accurate and concise. Let me list them out step by step, checking each one against the context to avoid mistakes.
