Okay, so I need to generate 10 questions and answers related to economic inequality based on the provided context and facts. Let me start by understanding the context and the facts given.

The context talks about various aspects of economic inequality, including income and wealth distribution, globalization's impact, the Gini coefficient, and mentions several notable individuals like Branko Milanović and Richard Wilkinson. The facts include DBpedia triples that relate to these topics, such as causes of economic inequality, works by specific authors, and various indicators related to inequality.

First, I should extract key points from the context:

1. **Income Inequality**: It peaked in the 1970s and then started converging globally, but inequality within nations has increased significantly in the last 30 years.
2. **Globalization's Impact**: While it reduced global inequality between nations, it increased inequality within nations.
3. **Gini Coefficient**: It measures income inequality; most advanced economies have seen a significant increase in their Gini coefficients over two points.
4. **Economic Policy and Theory**: Research links economic inequality to political instability and hindered growth. It's also linked to land and human capital inequality reducing growth more than income inequality.
5. **Relevant Works and Authors**: Branko Milanović, Richard Wilkinson, and Robert Wade have written about economic inequality. The Hidden Wealth of Nations by IQ and others is mentioned as a non-fiction subject.

Now, considering the facts, I can see that there are several DBpedia triples that provide more specific information on causes, subjects, and related works. For example:

- Causes like the 1968 movement in Pakistan.
- Works cited by economic inequality.
- Fields of study for individuals involved in economic inequality research.

To create questions and answers, I need to ensure each question is unique, relevant, and can be answered with a concise response from the context or facts. I should avoid repetition and make sure each answer fits within 10 words.

Let me brainstorm possible questions:

1. When did income inequality peak globally?
2. Has globalization increased global income inequality? Why?
3. What has caused rising inequality in advanced economies?
4. Which works are cited by researchers about economic inequality?
5. How much did the Gini coefficient increase in advanced economies?
6. Who wrote "The Hidden Wealth of Nations" and what does it focus on?
7. What is a key cause of economic inequality linked to globalization?
8. Which organizations have studies on wealth distribution?
9. What is mentioned about the relationship between economic growth and inequality?
10. Can I find more than one fact from the given DBpedia triples?

I think these questions cover various aspects of the context and can be answered using the provided facts. Now, I'll map each question to an answer.

For example:

- **Question 1**: "When did income inequality peak globally?"  
  Answer: "Income inequality peaked in the 1970s."

- **Question 2**: "Has globalization increased global income inequality? Why?"  
  Answer: "Globalization has increased inequality within nations."

And so on.

I'll make sure each answer is concise and accurately reflects the context or facts provided.
