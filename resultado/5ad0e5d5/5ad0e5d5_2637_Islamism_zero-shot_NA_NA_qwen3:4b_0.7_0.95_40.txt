Okay, the user wants me to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the provided context about Islamism. Let me start by understanding the context thoroughly.

First, I need to identify key points from the text. The context explains that Islamism is a political ideology aiming to apply Islamic principles in governance, society, and law. It mentions different strategies like revolutionary or reformist, the role of Sharia, pan-Islamic unity, and the distinction between Islamist movements and Islamic extremists. Also, there's a mention of figures like Hassan al-Banna, Sayyid Qutb, and Ruhollah Khomeini, as well as movements like the Muslim Brotherhood and the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL).

Now, I need to create questions that test understanding of these key points. The answers should be concise, up to 10 words. Let me brainstorm possible questions:

1. What is the main goal of Islamism?
2. What are the two main strategies in Islamism?
3. What does Islamism advocate for in terms of governance?
4. What is the role of Sharia in Islamism?
5. What is the difference between Islamist movements and Islamic extremists?
6. Who are some prominent figures in Islamism?
7. How do some Islamist movements approach their goals?
8. What is the term used by some Islamists to avoid the label "Islamism"?
9. What did Sayyid Qutb advocate?
10. What impact have Islamist movements had on the Middle East?

Now, check if these questions are clear and based on the context. The answers need to be accurate. For example, the main goal is to reconstitute states according to Islamic principles. The two strategies are revolutionary and reformist. Sharia is central to their vision. The difference is in methods: peaceful vs. violent. Prominent figures include the mentioned names. The term "Islamic movement" is used by some. Qutb advocated for violence, but he also denounced killing innocents. The impact is on politics and borders in the Middle East.

I need to ensure each answer is under 10 words. Let me adjust if necessary. Also, make sure the questions are in Portuguese and the answers are in Portuguese. The CSV format should be pergunta;resposta. Let me structure each pair correctly without any markdown. Double-check that all 10 are covered and the answers are accurate based on the context.
