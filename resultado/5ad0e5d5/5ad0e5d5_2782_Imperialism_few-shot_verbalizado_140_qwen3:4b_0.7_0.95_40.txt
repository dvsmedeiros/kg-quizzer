Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the provided context and facts. Let me start by understanding the context given.

The context defines imperialism as a state policy or practice of extending power and dominion, often through territorial acquisition or economic/control over other areas, using hard and soft power. It's distinct from colonialism and empire but applies to various forms of expansion.

Now, looking at the facts, there are a lot of mentions of different aspects like political ideologies, images, categories, and historical events related to imperialism. The examples include things like the Canadian Party having imperialism as its ideology, the Herero and Namaqua genocide being motivated by imperialism, and various images associated with different empires.

I need to make sure each question is unique and based on the facts. Let me brainstorm some possible questions. Maybe start with the definition, then move to types of imperialism, examples of motivations, related concepts, and specific historical events or ideologies.

Wait, the example given in the prompt includes questions about the origin of the term, how it's administered, the role of technology, the extension of power, types of imperialism, techniques used, and whether informal is dominant. So I should follow a similar approach but ensure the questions are varied.

Let me check the facts again. There's mention of "Imperialism usa modelo de página wiki Template:Authoritarian types of rule" which might relate to types of rule. Also, "Imperialism possui assunto Category:Political theories" and "Category:Invasions" could be used for questions.

Another fact is "Herero and Namaqua genocide possui motivação Imperialism" which can be turned into a question about the motivation behind that event. Similarly, "Japanese war crimes possui motivação Imperialism" could be another question.

I should also include questions about the different forms of imperialism, like formal vs. informal. The example given in the prompt includes "o domínio colonial seria considerado que tipo de imperialismo?" which is a question about the type of imperialism. Also, the definition of imperialism, its methods, and the distinction from colonialism and empire.

Let me make sure that each question is based on the facts provided. For instance, "Imperialism usa modelo de página wiki Template:Authoritarian types of rule" can be a question about the types of rule associated with imperialism. Also, the use of different templates in wiki pages might be a point of interest.

I need to avoid repeating the same types of questions. Let me list out possible questions:

1. Definition of imperialism
2. Types of imperialism (formal vs informal)
3. Motivation behind certain historical events (Herero, Japanese war crimes)
4. Methods used in imperialism (hard power, soft power)
5. Distinction from colonialism and empire
6. Political ideologies associated with imperialism (Canadian Party, Progressive Party)
7. Historical examples of imperialism (Portuguese Angola, etc.)
8. Categories related to imperialism (Political theories, Authoritarianism)
9. Techniques used in imperialism (division of countries)
10. Relationship between imperialism and economic control

Now, I need to convert these into specific questions and answers, ensuring that the answers are concise (up to 10 words) and based on the provided facts.

Let me check each point again. For example, the answer to the question about the origin of the term might not be in the context, but the example given in the prompt says the origin is Latin. Wait, the context doesn't mention that, but the example in the prompt uses "latina" as the answer. However, in the provided context, the definition is given, but the origin is not. However, the example might be from a different source. But according to the user's instructions, the answers must be based on the context, facts, or examples. So I need to make sure that the answers are derived from the given facts.

Looking back at the facts, there's "Imperialism usa modelo de página wiki Template:Authoritarian types of rule" which could be a question about the types of rule associated with imperialism. Also, "Imperialism usa modelo de página wiki Template:Political ideologies" which could be a question about the political ideologies linked to imperialism.

Another fact is "Imperialism possui assunto Category:Political theories" which could be a question about the categories related to imperialism.

The Herero and Namaqua genocide is an example of motivation. The Japanese war crimes also have that motivation.

For methods, the context says "using hard power (economic and military power), but also soft power (cultural and diplomatic power)" which is a key point.

So, the answer for "What are the methods used in imperialism?" would be "hard power and soft power".

Now, I need to structure 10 unique questions, each with a correct answer based on the facts. Let me check if I have 10 unique points. The example provided in the prompt includes 10 lines, so I need to generate 10 similar ones.

Let me proceed to create them now, ensuring they are distinct and based on the facts.
