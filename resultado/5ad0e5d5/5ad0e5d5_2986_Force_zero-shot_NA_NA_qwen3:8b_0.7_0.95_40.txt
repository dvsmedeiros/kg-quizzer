Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the provided physics context about force. Let me start by understanding the context thoroughly. The context explains that force is an influence that changes an object's motion, has magnitude and direction, is measured in newtons, and relates to Newton's second law. It also mentions concepts like thrust, drag, torque, internal mechanical stress, pressure, and deformation.

First, I should identify key points from the context to form questions. Let me list some important terms and concepts: force definition, vector quantity, newton unit, Newton's second law, acceleration proportionality, thrust, drag, torque, internal stress, pressure, deformation.

Now, I need to create 10 relevant questions. Each question should be concise and have a short answer. Let me think of possible questions:

1. What is force defined as? → Answer: Influence changing motion.
2. What unit measures force? → Answer: Newton (N).
3. What is force represented by? → Answer: Symbol F.
4. What is Newton's second law? → Answer: Net force equals momentum change rate.
5. What is acceleration proportional to? → Answer: Net force and inversely to mass.
6. What increases an object's velocity? → Answer: Thrust.
7. What decreases an object's velocity? → Answer: Drag.
8. What causes changes in rotational speed? → Answer: Torque.
9. What are internal forces called? → Answer: Mechanical stress.
10. What can unbalanced pressure cause? → Answer: Body acceleration.

Wait, some answers might be too long. Let me check the word count. For example, the answer to question 4 is "Net force equals momentum change rate." That's 7 words. The example allows up to 10, so that's okay. Maybe some answers can be shorter. For instance, question 5 could be "Proportional to net force and inversely to mass." That's 9 words. Okay.

I need to ensure that each question is unique and covers different aspects of the context. Let me verify each answer against the context to ensure accuracy. For example, the answer to question 9: "Internal mechanical stress" is correct. And question 10: unbalanced pressure can cause acceleration, which matches the context. 

Now, I'll format these into CSV, making sure the separator is a semicolon and the language is Portuguese. Let me check the answers again for conciseness. Maybe some can be phrased more succinctly. For example, question 1: "Influence that changes motion" instead of "Influence changing motion." But the example uses "Influence changing motion" as the answer, so that's acceptable. 

I think that's all. Let me compile the CSV now.
