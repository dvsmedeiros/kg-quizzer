Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the given context about Ctenophora. Let me start by understanding the context thoroughly.

The context describes Ctenophora, also known as comb jellies, which are marine invertebrates. Key points include their use of cilia for swimming, their size range, the structure of their bodies, their feeding habits, and their evolutionary position in the tree of life. There's also mention of fossils dating back to the Cambrian period and debates about their phylogenetic placement.

Now, I need to create questions that are relevant to this information. Each question should be followed by a short, correct answer (up to 10 words). Let me brainstorm possible questions:

1. What is the common name for Ctenophora?
2. How do Ctenophora move?
3. What is the size range of adult Ctenophora?
4. What are the sticky cells on their tentacles called?
5. What is the primary diet of most Ctenophora?
6. What is the significance of the fossils found in lagerstätten?
7. What is the debate about in molecular phylogenetics?
8. What is the Porifera Sister Hypothesis?
9. What are the exceptions in their feeding habits?
10. What is the primary method of movement for Ctenophora?

Now, I need to ensure each answer is concise and accurate. Let me check the context again to confirm:

- Common name: comb jellies.
- Movement: using cilia (combs).
- Size: mm to 1.5m.
- Sticky cells: colloblasts.
- Diet: prey ranging from larvae to crustaceans.
- Fossils: early Cambrian, 525 million years ago.
- Debate: ctenophores' position in the tree of life.
- Porifera Sister Hypothesis: sponges as sister-group.
- Exceptions: juvenile parasites on salps.
- Movement: cilia.

Now, I'll structure each pair in the CSV format, making sure the answers are within 10 words. Let me verify each one again to avoid errors. For example, "colloblasts" is correct, and the exceptions are juveniles of two species. The debate is about their phylogenetic position. The Porifera Sister Hypothesis is mentioned as a theory. All answers are accurate based on the context. I think that's all. Let me put them in the correct format now.
