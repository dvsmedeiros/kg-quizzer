Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the provided context about the Huguenots. Let me start by understanding the context thoroughly.

The context talks about the Huguenots being French Protestants, their history, the religious conflicts, key figures like Jeanne d'Albret and Henry IV, the Edict of Nantes, the Edict of Fontainebleau, persecution under Louis XIV, and the eventual end of persecution with the Edict of Versailles. 

First, I should identify key facts and events that can form questions. Each question needs to be concise and have a short answer. Let me list possible questions:

1. What was the primary religious group of the Huguenots?
   - Answer: French Protestants.

2. Who was a key leader of the Huguenots?
   - Answer: Jeanne d'Albret.

3. Which event granted Huguenots autonomy?
   - Answer: Edict of Nantes.

4. What was the name of the persecution under Louis XIV?
   - Answer: Dragonnades.

5. Which edict revoked Protestant rights in France?
   - Answer: Edict of Fontainebleau.

6. What percentage of the French population were Huguenots in 1572?
   - Answer: Up to 10%.

7. When did the French Wars of Religion end?
   - Answer: 1598.

8. What did Louis XIV claim about the Huguenot population?
   - Answer: Reduced to 1,000.

9. Which edict ended official persecution of Protestants?
   - Answer: Edict of Versailles.

10. What happened to Huguenots after the Edict of Fontainebleau?
    - Answer: Forced to convert or flee.

Now, I need to ensure each answer is under 10 words. Let me check each one:

1. "French Protestants" – good.
2. "Jeanne d'Albret" – correct.
3. "Edict of Nantes" – yes.
4. "Dragonnades" – correct.
5. "Edict of Fontainebleau" – fits.
6. "Up to 10%" – concise.
7. "1598" – okay.
8. "Reduced to 1,000" – yes.
9. "Edict of Versailles" – correct.
10. "Forced to convert or flee" – under 10 words.

I think these are all valid. Now, format them into CSV with semicolons. Make sure there are no markdown elements and just the CSV lines. Let me double-check the answers for accuracy based on the context. Yes, all answers match the information provided. Alright, that should do it.
