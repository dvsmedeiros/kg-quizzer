pergunta;resposta
1. What is the definition of a prime number?;A natural number greater than 1 not divisible by any smaller number.
2. What are numbers greater than 1 that are not prime called?;composite numbers.
3. What theorem states that every natural number greater than 1 is either prime or can be uniquely factored into primes?;fundamental theorem of arithmetic.
4. What is the name of the property that determines if a number is prime or not?;primality.
5. What is the name of the algorithm that checks primality by testing divisibility by numbers up to the square root?;trial division.
6. What is the name of the probabilistic algorithm used for primality testing?;Miller–Rabin primality test.
7. What is the name of the deterministic algorithm that always gives the correct answer for primality?;AKS primality test.
8. What is the largest known prime number as of December 2018 in terms of digits?;24,862,048 decimal digits.
9. What are some unsolved problems related to prime numbers?;Goldbach's conjecture and twin prime conjecture.
10. What are the applications of prime numbers in information technology?;public-key cryptography.
Wait, the example answers in the problem are shorter. For example, "O que são números maiores que 1 que podem ser divididos por 3 ou mais números chamados?;número composto." So the answer is "número composto" (6 words). So maybe I need to make the answers more concise.
