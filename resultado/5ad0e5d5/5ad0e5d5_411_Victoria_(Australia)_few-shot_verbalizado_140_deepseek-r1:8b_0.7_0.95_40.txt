Ok, I need to create a CSV file with 10 question;answer pairs based on the given context and facts. Let me start by understanding what's required.

First, each question should be relevant and linked to Victoria's context. The answers must be concise, up to 10 words, and directly derivable from the provided information.

I'll go through the context and facts to identify key points that can form questions. For example, the context mentions that Victoria is bordered by New South Wales to the north and South Australia to the west. So a question about its neighboring states makes sense.

Looking at the facts, I see entries like "1909 Inter-State Series está localizado em Victoria (Australia)" which translates to "The 1909 Inter-State Series is located in Victoria (Australia)". This can be used as a fact about an event hosted there.

Next, some names of places or people related to Victoria. For instance, "Melbourne hosts a number of museums..." So questions about cultural aspects could work.

I'll need to ensure each question is unique and covers different aspects: geography, culture, history, economy, etc. To avoid repetition, I'll spread the topics as much as possible.

Let me list possible questions based on context:
1. What are Victoria's neighboring states?
2. Where is the Great Australian Bight located in relation to Victoria?
3. Which city is known as Melbourne's capital of sports?
4. How many million people live in Victoria?
5. Who was Victoria's Premier since 2014?

Now, for the facts:
- "1909 Inter-State Series está localizado em Victoria (Australia)" → The 1909 Inter-State Series is located in Victoria.
- "Rory Sloane nasceu em Victoria (Australia)" → Rory Sloane was born in Victoria.

I'll make sure each fact is converted into a relevant question. For example, using the first fact: What major event was hosted in Victoria in 1909? The answer would be the Inter-State Series.

Similarly, for Rory Sloane: Who is known for being born in Victoria?

Now, I'll structure these into questions and ensure they are clear and directly answerable from the context or facts provided. I need to make sure each pair adheres strictly to the format without any extra information.
