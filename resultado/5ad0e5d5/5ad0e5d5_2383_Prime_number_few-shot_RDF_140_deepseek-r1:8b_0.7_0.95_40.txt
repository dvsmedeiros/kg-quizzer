Okay, so I need to create 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the given context about prime numbers. Let me start by understanding the instructions and the provided information.

First, the context covers a lot of topics related to prime numbers: definitions, theorems like the fundamental theorem of arithmetic, methods for checking primality such as trial division, Miller-Rabin test, AKS test, properties of primes, historical conjectures, and applications in cryptography. There are also facts from DBpedia about specific prime numbers and their factorizations.

I should make sure that each question is relevant to this context and has one correct short answer. The questions need to be varied and cover different aspects of prime numbers. Also, I must avoid repeating similar questions.

Let me go through the context again to identify key points that can be turned into questions:

1. Definition of a prime number.
2. Difference between prime and composite numbers.
3. Fundamental theorem of arithmetic.
4. Types of primality tests (trial division vs Miller-Rabin).
5. Largest known prime as of 2018.
6. Mersenne primes.
7. Euclid's proof of infinite primes.
8. Prime number theorem.
9. Goldbach's conjecture.
10. Twin prime conjecture.

Now, I'll think about possible questions that can be asked based on these points.

1. What is a prime number? - The answer would be something like "A natural number greater than 1 that isn't a product of smaller numbers."
2. What distinguishes primes from composites? - Answer: "Primes have no divisors other than 1 and themselves."
3. Which theorem states every number >1 is either prime or can be factored uniquely? - The fundamental theorem of arithmetic.
4. Which method is slow for checking primality? - Trial division.
5. What's the largest known prime with many digits? - As of Dec 2018, it's a Mersenne prime with 22.338.618 digits.
6. Which special-form primes are mentioned? - Mersenne primes.
7. Who proved there are infinitely many primes? - Euclid.
8. What does the prime number theorem say about probability? - The probability decreases with more digits.
9. What's Goldbach's conjecture about? - Every even >2 can be expressed as two primes.
10. What is the twin prime conjecture? - Infinitely many pairs of primes with one even between them.

I need to ensure each question is clear and directly relates to the context, with a concise correct answer. I'll make sure not to repeat similar questions and cover different aspects of prime numbers.

Now, putting it all together in CSV format, each line will have a question followed by its answer.
