Okay, I need to generate 10 CSV pairs based on the provided context and facts. Let me start by understanding the content. The main subject is the IPCC, an organization under the UN. The facts mention its establishment, members, structure, reports, and key people.

First, I'll look for different aspects of the IPCC: its role, founding organizations, headquarters, member states, structure, reports, leadership, and achievements. The example given includes questions about the UN, WMO, UNEP, headquarters, member states, working groups, Nobel Prize, and the Paris Agreement.

I need to make sure each question is unique and covers different areas. Let me check the facts again. The facts include details like the headquarters in Geneva, member states, working groups, the Nobel Prize in 2007, the Paris Agreement influence, the 2015 resignation of Rajendra K. Pachauri, and the 2023 Synthesis Report.

Wait, the user's example included questions about the president, vice-president, and when Pachauri resigned. So I should include those as well. Also, the fact that the IPCC is part of the UN and the WMO/UNEP established it.

I need to avoid repeating similar questions. Let me list possible topics: organization's role, founding bodies, headquarters, member count, working groups, Nobel Prize, Paris Agreement, leadership changes, assessment cycles, reports, and special reports.

Now, I'll structure each question and answer based on the facts. For example, "Qual é o órgão que criou o IPCC?" answer: "WMO e UNEP". "Onde o IPCC tem sua sede principal?" answer: "Geneva, Suíça". "Quantos países são membros do IPCC?" answer: "195".

I need to ensure the answers are concise and directly from the context. Also, check that all answers are within 10 words. Let me verify each fact against the provided text and facts. For instance, the Nobel Prize is mentioned as shared with Al Gore in 2007. The Paris Agreement was influenced by the Fifth Assessment Report.

Another point is the 2015 resignation of Pachauri, which is a key fact. Also, the six assessment cycle ending in 2023. The special reports like the 1.5°C report in 2018.

I should also include questions about the structure, like the three working groups and the task force. The secretariat being hosted by WMO. The role of the bureau elected by member states.

Wait, the user's example had questions about the president and vice-president. The current president is Hoesung Lee, and the previous one was Bert Bolin. The vice-president is Ismail El Gizouli. Also, the fact that the IPCC has three working groups and a task force.

I need to make sure each question is unique. Let me count: 10 questions. Let me start compiling them now, ensuring each is distinct and covers different aspects.
