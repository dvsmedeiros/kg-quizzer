Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to understand what the user is asking for. They provided a bunch of data in the form of triples and asked me to generate a CSV based on specific instructions and rules.

Looking at the data, it seems to be related to political movements and ideologies connected to Islamism. The task mentions generating a CSV with certain columns: Subject, Agent, Value, Type, and Description. There are also some specific rules like using semicolons for multiple values where applicable.

I notice that each line in the provided data has two parts separated by a colon after "a". This probably indicates subject and value pairs. For example, "Subject of the document" followed by various agent-value pairs like "PersonFunction: The_Islamist".

So my first step is to extract these subject lines and then parse the agent-value pairs accordingly.

Next, I need to identify which agents are involved—like Persons, Movements, Ideologies, etc. Each has a specific format for their values:

- Person: Values can be strings like "Name; Location" or just one value.
- Movement: Typically includes names separated by semicolons and/or commas, possibly with more details after the first comma.
- Ideology: Often contains multiple terms separated by semicolons.

I'll need to extract these correctly and map them under their respective agent types. Additionally, some lines might have multiple values for an agent, which I should handle carefully—like ensuring each value is on a new line if there are multiple.

I also see that some agents don't require additional information (e.g., "Movement" without extra details), so those can be handled straightforwardly.

Finally, compiling all this into the CSV with proper headers and formatting. It's important to ensure consistency across rows, using semicolons where necessary for multi-value entries.

Throughout this process, I should double-check each value against its respective agent type rules to avoid mismatches or incorrect data types in the final CSV.
