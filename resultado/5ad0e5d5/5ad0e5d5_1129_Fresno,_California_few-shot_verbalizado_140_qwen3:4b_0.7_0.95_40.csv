The city's status as an economic hub and its location in the San Joaquin Valley are important. Maybe a question about its economic role. The mention of droughts affecting water security is a recent issue; so a question about that could be included.
Also; the city's status as the third-largest majority-Hispanic city in the U.S. is a fact. So that's another point.
