Okay, so I need to create a CSV file with 10 question-response pairs based on the given context about construction. Let me start by reviewing the instructions and the provided content.

First, the output should be in Portuguese, using semicolons as separators. Each line is "pergunta;resposta". The questions must be varied and cover different aspects of construction from the abstract and facts provided.

Looking at the context, it's a detailed explanation about construction, its history, processes, economic impact, safety issues, and specific companies in the industry. The facts section lists various companies, their roles, and related terms like "tensile structure" and "hypernyms".

I should extract key points from both sections to form varied questions. Let me brainstorm possible question topics:

1. Etymology of construction
2. Stages involved in construction
3. Contribution of the construction industry to GDP
4. Safety issues in construction
5. Types of structures built by construction companies
6. Companies in the construction industry
7. Processes beyond building, like repairs and demolition
8. Percentage contribution to GDP
9. Biggest projects known as (megaprojects)
10. Factors considered in construction planning

Now, let me structure each question and find the answer from the context.

1. The etymology comes from Latin "constructio", so the question could be about the origin of the term.
2. Construction processes include planning, financing, design, etc., as mentioned.
3. The percentage is given in the abstract: 6-9% or 13% depending on the year, but perhaps 6-9% is more specific.
4. Safety issues are highlighted with statistics about fatalities.
5. Structures like buildings, infrastructure, industrial facilities.
6. Specific companies from the facts section, like Beazer or Henry Boot plc.
7. Beyond building, processes include repairs, maintenance, expansion, etc.
8. From the abstract, 13% of GDP is mentioned.
9. Megaprojects are referred to as large construction projects.
10. Factors considered: zoning requirements, environmental impact, budget, logistics.

I need to ensure each question has a unique and correct answer from the context without repetition. Let me check for any overlaps or similar questions to avoid redundancy.

Now, I'll structure each line in Portuguese with the appropriate question and concise answer.
