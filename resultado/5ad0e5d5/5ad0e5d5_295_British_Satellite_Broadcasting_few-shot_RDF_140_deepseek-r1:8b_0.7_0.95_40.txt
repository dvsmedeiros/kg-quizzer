Ok, I need to help generate 10 question;answer pairs in CSV format based on the given context. Let me start by understanding what's provided.

The context is about British Satellite Broadcasting (BSB), which was a TV company that merged with Sky Television. The facts mention several TV channels owned by BSB, like Galaxy and The Movie Channel, and some details like the merger date and location.

I need to create relevant questions and correct short answers. Let me think of different aspects: ownership of channels, merger details, founding year, locations, successors, etc.

First question about ownership: Galaxy 1's owner is BSB. That seems straightforward.

Next, the company was merged with Sky in 1990. I should phrase it clearly.

What about the founding year? It was established in 1986.

Location-wise, their headquarters were in London and England.

Who succeeded BSB? It was Sky UK.

The Movie Channel's owner is also BSB.

Now, to make sure each question is unique and covers different facts. Also, check that answers are directly from the context without extra info.

Let me list them out:

1. Galaxy 1 ownership.
2. merger date with Sky.
3. founding year.
4. locations of headquarters.
5. successor company.
6. The Movie Channel ownership.
7. Memphis Belle's production company.
8. Now TV channel owner.
9. Computer Channel owner.
10. The Power Station ownership.

Each should have a clear, concise answer based on the facts provided. I need to ensure no repetition and that each question is distinct enough.
