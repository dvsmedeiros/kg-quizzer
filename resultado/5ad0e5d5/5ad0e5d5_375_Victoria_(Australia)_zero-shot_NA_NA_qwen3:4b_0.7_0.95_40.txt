Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the provided context about Victoria, Australia. Let me start by understanding the context thoroughly. The text gives a lot of information about Victoria's geography, population, history, government, economy, and culture.

First, I'll identify key points that can be turned into questions. For example, the state's location, area, population, capital, historical events, government structure, economy, and cultural aspects. I need to make sure each question is relevant and the answers are concise, under 10 words.

Let me list possible questions and their answers. For instance, the capital city of Victoria is Melbourne. The population is over 6.5 million. The state was named after Queen Victoria. The Labor Party has governed since 2014. The economy is the second-largest in Australia. The state is divided into 79 local government areas. The gold rush in the 1850s increased population and wealth. Victoria has four of Australia's 20 largest cities. The Governor is Linda Dessau. The state is bordered by New South Wales, South Australia, and the Bass Strait.

Now, I need to check if each answer is within 10 words. Some might need to be rephrased. For example, "Victoria is the second most populated state" is concise. "Named in honour of Queen Victoria" is also short. 

I should ensure that the questions are in Portuguese and the answers are accurate. Also, the CSV format must be correct, with each pair separated by a semicolon. Let me verify each pair to avoid repetition and ensure they cover different aspects of the context.

Once all 10 are done, I'll present them in the required CSV format without any additional text.
