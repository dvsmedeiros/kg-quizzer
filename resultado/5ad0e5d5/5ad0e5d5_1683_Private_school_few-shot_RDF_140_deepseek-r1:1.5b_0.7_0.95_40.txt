Okay, let's see what the user is asking for here. They provided a CSV file with various schools and colleges, specifying whether each is a public or private institution. The task is to generate code that reads this CSV, applies the same rules as in the example, and outputs it correctly.

First, I need to figure out how to structure the Python program based on the given data. Looking at the CSV, the first row defines the types for schools like "Public" or "Private." Then each subsequent row has a school name followed by its type.

So, my approach should be:

1. **Read the CSV Data**: I'll use pandas to read the CSV file. The first row will set the default header for columns after the first.
2. **Parse Each Row**: For each row, extract the school names and their types.
3. **Apply the Same Rules**: Use the same criteria as in the example, which includes checking if a school is public or private based on whether its type matches "Public" or "Private."
4. **Handle Exceptions**: If a row doesn't have an expected number of entries (like 2 for each entry after the first), I should consider it an error and skip adding anything to that line.
5. **Format Output**: Each entry should be in the format "school_name, type=Public" or "school_name, type=Private," ensuring proper formatting.

Now, considering potential issues: What if a row doesn't have two entries? For example, a school name alone without a type. I'll need to handle that by checking if there are exactly two fields after the first one and only include it if so.

Another point is the case where a school might be incorrectly named or misspelled. The code should ignore any entries with errors in the structure but still display them for readability, though according to the user's instructions, they only need to apply the rules correctly, not necessarily fix names.

Putting it all together, I'll write Python code using pandas to read and process the CSV, then format each entry as specified. This should handle all cases within the provided data.

Aqui est치 o c칩digo para levar o CSV conforme as regras e formattedo como desejamos:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Carregar o arquivo CSV
df = pd.read_csv(' school_list.csv', sep=',')
df.columns = ['school_name', 'type']  # Remover o novo header

resultado = []
for index, row in df.iterrows():
    if len(row) != 2:
        continue  # Mantive linhas que possam precisar revisar
    school = row[0]
    tipo = row[1].lower()
    
    if tipo not in ('public', 'private'):
        continue
    
    resultado.append(f"{school}, {tipo}").strip()

# Mostrar o resultado
print("\nResultado:", "\n".join(resulto))
```

Agora, vamos ver como est치 funcionando:

```
 school_list.csv has this data:
[
  ['School Name', 'type'],
  ['University of California, Los Angeles', 'Public'],
  ['St. John's International Academy', 'Private'],
  ... mas outros
]

O resultado ser치 mostrado com as linhas de school e type como na imagem.
