Okay, so I need to generate a quiz based on the provided context about Huguenots. Let me start by understanding what exactly is being asked here.

First, the user wants 10 pairs of question and answer in CSV format. Each pair should consist of one relevant question and its correct short answer. The language has to be Portuguese, and each entry should be separated by a semicolon. Also, only the CSV output without any additional text is needed.

Looking at the context, it's a detailed paragraph about the Huguenots, covering their history from the Protestant Reformation to their eventual decline under Louis XIV and their impact on France. The main points include when they were prominent, their decline after the Edict of Fontainebleau in 1685, the conflicts known as the French Wars of Religion, their leaders like Jeanne d'Albret and Henry IV, the Edict of Nantes, the abolition of their privileges, and the final eradication by the Revolution.

Now, I need to create 10 questions that cover these points. Each question should be clear and directly related to one specific piece of information from the context. The answers must be concise, no more than 10 words.

Let me list out key facts:

1. Timeline: Huguenots existed in mid-16th century.
2. Decline after Edict of Fontainebleau (1685).
3. Conflict started in 1562 and ended in 1598.
4. Led by Jeanne d'Albret, Henry IV, and Condé princes.
5. Autonomy was granted by Edict of Nantes but lost later.
6. Huguenot population reduced from ~800,000 to about 1,500 under Louis XIV.
7. Brain drain due to exodus leading to important social positions being vacated.
8. Persecution ended with Edict of Versailles in 1787 after Revolution.

Now, I'll craft each question and answer pair based on these points:

Question about when Huguenots were prominent: mid-16th century.
Next, the year they declined after Edict of Fontainebleau: 1685.
Conflict's start and end years: 1562 to 1598.
Leaders' names: Jeanne d'Albret, Henry IV, Condé princes.
Autonomy period under Edict of Nantes: 1567-1635.
Population reduction post-Louis XIV: ~800k to ~1.5k.
Brain drain impact on society: Important positions vacated.
Persecution end year: 1787 (Edict of Versailles).
Huguenot name: Calvinists.

Wait, the last point is a bit vague in the context. I should make sure it's accurately represented as Calvinism, which was their religious stance after conversion to Catholicism or as Nicodemes.

Putting all together into questions and short answers:

1. When were the Huguenots prominent?
Answer: Mid-16th century.

2. In 1685, what did the Edict of Fontainebleau do to them?
Answer: Declined their influence.

3. When did the French Wars of Religion start and end?
Answer: 1562–1598.

4. Who led the Huguenots?
Answer: Jeanne d'Albret, Henry IV, Condé princes.

5. What autonomy was granted to Huguenots by Edict of Nantes?
Answer: 1567-1635.

6. How many adherents did the Huguenot population reduce to under Louis XIV?
Answer: About 800,000 down to 1,500.

7. What impact did Huguenot exodus have on society?
Answer: Vacated important positions.

8. When did Calvinism nearly disappear in France?
Answer: 1787 (Edict of Versailles).

9. What were the Huguenots called once they converted to Catholicism?
Answer: Nicodemes.

That should cover all necessary points with accurate and concise answers.
