Okay, I need to create a CSV file with 10 question;answer pairs based on the given context about the Black Death. The questions should be relevant and have correct short answers. Let me start by identifying key points from the context.

First, the Black Death was a pandemic caused by Yersinia pestis. It started in Central or East Asia, spread via fleas on black rats. It hit Europe around 1347-1353, causing massive deaths. The mortality rate was high, affecting societies and economies. There were later outbreaks until the 19th century.

I should make sure each question is unique and covers different aspects. Let me think of possible questions:

1. What caused the Black Death? -> Bubonic plague.
2. Where did it start? -> Central or East Asia.
3. How long did it last in Europe? -> 1347-1353.
4. What percentage of Europe's population died? -> 30-60%.
5. Why was there a rapid spread inland? -> Human contact via aerosols.
6. How was the disease transmitted? -> Fleas on black rats, especially in trading ports.
7. What economic impact did it have? -> Decline in trade and labor shortages.
8. What regions were affected besides Europe? -> North Africa, Middle East.
9. When did outbreaks recur? -> Until the early 19th century.
10. How was the population affected globally? -> Reduced from ~475 million to 350-375 million.

I need to ensure each question is clear and the answers are concise, directly from the context without repetition. Now, I'll format these into CSV lines.
