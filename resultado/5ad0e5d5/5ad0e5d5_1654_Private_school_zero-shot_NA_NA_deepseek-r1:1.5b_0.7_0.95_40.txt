Okay, I need to create 10 pairs of questions with answers based on the given context about private schools. The context talks about how private schools operate independently from government funds and have their own governance structures like a board of governors.

First, I should identify key points or definitions that can be turned into clear questions. Let me list out important aspects:

1. What defines a private school? They are not run by the government.
2. How do private schools typically function? They operate independently without state funding.
3. Are there specific boards of governors for private schools?
4. Does each private school have its own system of governance?
5. Private schools usually maintain their own campuses, right?
6. Do they require a certain amount of funding to be considered private?
7. How does the government's role differ from that of private schools in a local context?
8. What services do private schools generally offer?
9. Are there any exceptions to these definitions? Maybe some private schools don't operate without a board.
10. Do private schools usually have a reputation for excellence and education?

Now, I'll structure each question around these points, ensuring clarity so the answers can be concise.

Let me write them out:

1. What defines a private school?
2. How do private schools typically operate compared to public schools?
3. Do private schools require a specific amount of funding to remain as private?
4. Does each private school have its own governance board? 
5. Are private schools usually located on their own campuses?
6. Do private schools generally offer academic and extracurricular services?
7. What role do the government play in relation to private education?
8. Can any private schools operate independently without a board of governors?
9. What are the common reputations for private schools in terms of education quality?
10. Are there exceptions where a private school doesn't need a board?

Now, I'll provide the answers corresponding to these questions.

I should make sure the answers are short and cover each point without being too wordy.
