Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs in Portuguese based on the given context about EU law. Let me start by understanding the context provided.

The context mentions that EU law is a supranational system in the 27 member states, starting from the European Coal and Steel Community in 1952. It's based on treaties, interpreted by the Court of Justice of the European Union. The facts include some DBpedia triples about resources related to EU law, like academic disciplines and scholars.

First, I'll list possible questions. The main points are the origin (1952, European Coal and Steel Community), the purpose (peace, social justice, etc.), the constitutional structure (treaties), the judicial branch (Court of Justice), and maybe some specific examples from the facts, like the Common Market Law Review or Henry G. Schermers.

I need to make sure each question is unique and covers different aspects. Let me think of 10 different angles:

1. When was the EU law system established? (Answer: 1952, European Coal and Steel Community)
2. What are the main goals of EU law? (Peace, social justice, etc.)
3. What forms the constitutional structure? (Treaties)
4. Who interprets EU law? (Court of Justice)
5. What is the name of the court? (Court of Justice of the European Union)
6. What is the primary topic of the Wikipedia page? (Law of the European Union)
7. Which academic discipline is the Common Market Law Review related to? (Law of the European Union)
8. What is Henry G. Schermers' sub-discipline? (Law of the European Union)
9. What fields does John Bell study? (Law of the European Union)
10. What templates are used in the DBpedia page? (Redirect_category_shell, etc.)

Now, check if the answers are in the context. The first answer is in the abstract. The treaties are mentioned as forming the constitutional structure. The court is mentioned as the judicial branch. The primary topic is in the facts. The academic disciplines are in the triples. The templates are listed in the facts.

Now, translate these into Portuguese, keeping answers under 10 words. Make sure each pair is unique and correct. Avoid repetition. Ensure the CSV format with semicolons.
