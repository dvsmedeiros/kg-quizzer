Okay, so I need to create a quiz with 10 questions and answers based on the provided context about Ctenophora. Let me go through this step by step.

First, I'll start by reading the abstract carefully to understand the key points. Ctenophores are marine invertebrates known as comb jellies. They use cilia called "combs" for swimming and are the largest animals to do so. Their sizes vary from a few millimeters up to 1.5 meters. There are about 100-150 validated species, with some others not fully described yet.

The abstract also mentions their body structures—jelly-like bodies with two-cell layers outside and lining the internal cavity. They have various forms like cydippids, platyctenids, and beroids. Most are predators, feeding on small prey, except for certain juvenile stages that act as parasites.

Fossils suggest they date back to the early Cambrian period, around 525 million years ago. There's a debate about their position in the animal tree of life—whether they're sister to sponges or emerged earlier.

Looking at the facts provided, Ctenophora is classified under various categories like WikicatCtenophores and Organism100004475. They have different subdivisions like Tentaculata, Nuda, and Scleroctenophora. The type species is Mnemiopsis leidyi.

Now, I need to create 10 varied questions. Let me list possible topics:

1. Common name for Ctenophora.
2. Body structure (layers).
3. Use of cilia for swimming.
4. Size range.
5. Number of validated species.
6. Main mode of feeding.
7. Fossil history and age.
8. Taxonomic debates.
9. Subdivisions within the phylum.
10. Type species.

I should ensure each question is unique and covers different aspects. Let me draft them:

1. What are Ctenophora commonly known as? → Comb jellies.
2. How many cell layers do they have externally? → Two cells thick.
3. What do they use for swimming? → Groups of cilia ("combs").
4. What is the size range of adult Ctenophores? → A few millimeters to 1.5 m.
5. Approximately how many species are validated? → 100-150.
6. What do they primarily function as? → Predators.
7. How old are their fossils? → Around 525 million years.
8. What is the taxonomic debate about? → Sister group status with sponges or earlier emergence.
9. Name a subdivision of Ctenophora. → Tentaculata, Nuda, Scleroctenophora.
10. Which species is considered the type for Ctenophora? → Mnemiopsis leidyi.

I think these cover a broad range of topics without repeating similar questions. Each question has a clear and concise answer based on the provided context. Now, I'll format them into CSV as required.
