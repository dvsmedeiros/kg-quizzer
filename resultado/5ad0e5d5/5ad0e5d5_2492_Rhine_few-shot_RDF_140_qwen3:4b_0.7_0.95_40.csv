Now; I'll start compiling the data. The main entity is the Rhine. Then the Rhône–Rhine Canal connects to the Rhine. The Saar is a tributary. The Rhine Falls is a feature. The Rhine Bridge in Kehl is a structure. The Three Countries Bridge is another bridge. The Weiß river is part of the system. The Schwarza river is in the Black Forest. The Wupper and Wutach rivers are tributaries. The Rhine Bridge in Kehl is a separate entity. The Three Countries Bridge is also a separate entity.
