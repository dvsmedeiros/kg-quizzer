Okay, I need to generate 10 questions and answers based on the provided context about private schools in various countries. Each question should be followed by a short correct answer.

First, I'll look at the context given. It explains that private schools are not funded or administered by government unlike public schools. There's also a list of examples from different countries like the US, Canada, Australia, and others with their respective private schools.

I notice that some countries have specific types of private schools mentioned, such as Montessori, Christian, or religious-based schools. The task is to create varied questions related to these points.

I'll start by identifying key facts: definition, examples from different regions, types of schools like Montessori, religious affiliation, and funding sources.

For each question, I should ensure it's clear, relevant, and has only one correct answer based on the context provided. I need to avoid repeating similar questions or topics.

Let me brainstorm some potential questions:

1. What is a characteristic of private schools? (Answer: Not funded by government)
2. Where is there an example of a Montessori school in the list? (Answer: Gahanna Christian Academy)
3. Which country has private schools mentioned more than once? (Answer: United States)
4. What type of institution is Hanoi International School? (Answer: Private)
5. How are some private schools funded besides government sources? (Answer: Individual donations or fees)
6. Name a private school in the Middle East. (Answer: M.E.S. Indian School)
7. Which country has an example with religious affiliation? (Answer: Australia, like St. Paul Academy and Summit School)
8. What is another name for independent schools? (Answer: Private schools)
9. How many countries have examples listed of private schools in the context? (Answer: 10 [counting each mentioned])
10. Where can you find examples of both Montessori and religious private schools? (Answer: United States)

I need to make sure these questions are varied and cover different aspects like definitions, examples from various regions, types of schools, funding sources, and specific details.

Now, I'll structure each question and answer pair in the specified CSV format.
