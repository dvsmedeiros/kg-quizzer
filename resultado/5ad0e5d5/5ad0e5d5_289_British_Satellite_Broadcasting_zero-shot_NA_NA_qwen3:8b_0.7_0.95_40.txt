Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the provided context about British Satellite Broadcasting (BSB). 

First, I need to understand the context thoroughly. The key points are: BSB was a TV company based in London, started broadcasting on March 25, 1990, and merged with Sky Television plc on November 2, 1990, forming British Sky Broadcasting.

Now, I need to create 10 relevant questions. Let me brainstorm possible questions. Each question should be concise and directly related to the context. The answers need to be short, up to 10 words. 

Starting with the basics: What was the headquarters of BSB? Answer: London. That's straightforward. Next, when did BSB start broadcasting? March 25, 1990. Then, the merger date with Sky Television. November 2, 1990. The merged company's name is British Sky Broadcasting. 

What was the purpose of BSB? To provide direct broadcast satellite TV services. Who was the merged company with? Sky Television plc. What was the result of the merger? Formed British Sky Broadcasting. 

How many years after starting did BSB merge? Wait, the start was March 1990, merged November 1990. So about 8 months, but maybe the user wants the answer in years? But the context says merged on November 2, 1990, so maybe the answer is 8 months. But the user might prefer exact dates. Alternatively, maybe ask when was the merger date? Answer: November 2, 1990. 

Another question: What was the merged company called? British Sky Broadcasting. What was the main service provided by BSB? Direct broadcast satellite TV. What was the headquarters location? London. 

Wait, I need to make sure each question is unique and covers different aspects. Let me check if I have 10. Let's list them:

1. Headquarters of BSB?
2. Start date of broadcasting?
3. Merger date with Sky?
4. Merged company name?
5. Purpose of BSB?
6. Who was merged with?
7. Result of the merger?
8. How long after start did merger happen? (But maybe better to ask merger date)
9. Main service provided?
10. What was the merged company called?

Hmm, maybe the merger date is covered in question 3 and 7. Let me adjust. Maybe the merger date is question 3, and the result is question 4. Then, what was the merged company's name? That's question 4. 

Wait, the user might want to avoid repetition. Let me ensure each question is distinct. Let me list all 10:

1. What was the headquarters of BSB?
2. When did BSB start broadcasting?
3. When was BSB merged with Sky Television?
4. What was the merged company called?
5. What was the purpose of BSB?
6. Which company was merged with BSB?
7. What was the result of the merger?
8. What was the main service provided by BSB?
9. Where was BSB headquartered?
10. What was the merged company's name?

Wait, some of these are overlapping. For example, questions 1 and 9 are the same. Need to avoid that. Let me rephrase. 

1. Where was BSB headquartered?
2. When did BSB start broadcasting?
3. When was BSB merged with Sky Television?
4. What was the merged company's name?
5. What was the purpose of BSB?
6. Which company was merged with B.
7. What was the result of the merger?
8. What was the main service provided by BSB?
9. What was the merger date?
10. What was the merged company called?

Wait, maybe some questions can be phrased differently. Let me check for uniqueness. Also, the answers need to be concise. For example, the merger date is November 2, 1990. The merged company's name is British Sky Broadcasting. 

I think that's 10. Now, format them into CSV, ensuring the separator is semicolon. Also, check that the answers are within 10 words. Let me proceed.
