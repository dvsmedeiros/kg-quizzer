Okay, so I'm trying to help the user generate a CSV file based on their instructions and the data they provided. Let me start by understanding what they need.

First, looking at the data, it's a list of educational institutions with URLs pointing to their DBpedia entries. Each line has the format `<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Institution_Name> <predicate> <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Private_school>.`, where `predicate` is either `type` or another property like `schooltype`.

The user's instruction says they want a CSV that lists each institution and its type, specifically whether it's a private school. So the CSV should have two columns: " Instituição" (Institution) and " Tipo" (Type).

I need to extract each institution name from the URLs. For example, from `<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Calvert_Hall_College>`, the institution is "Calvert Hall College". Each line in the data corresponds to one row in the CSV.

I should also make sure that the CSV uses semicolons as delimiters because the user mentioned using Portuguese settings. Additionally, the header should be in Portuguese: " Instituição; Tipo".

Looking at the data, most lines use either `type` or another predicate pointing to `Private_school`. I'll consider both cases and treat them as indicating that the institution is private.

I need to go through each line, extract the institution name, and then set the type as "Privada" for all entries since they are all linked to Private_school. 

Wait, let me double-check if there's any variation in the data. Scanning through, I see some use `type` and others might have different predicates, but all point to `Private_school`. So it's safe to assume each institution is private.

I should also ensure that special characters are handled correctly, especially since some names might contain accents or other Unicode characters common in Portuguese. The CSV should be encoded in UTF-8 to handle this properly.

Putting it all together, I'll structure the CSV with the header and then list each institution followed by "Privada". Since there are 150 institutions listed, the CSV will have 150 rows plus the header.

I think that's about it. Now, I just need to format everything correctly as per the user's instructions.
