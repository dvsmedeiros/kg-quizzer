Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the provided context about the Normans. Let me start by carefully reading through the given text to extract key facts and ensure the questions are accurate and varied.

First, the Normans originated from the intermingling of Norse Vikings and West Franks. So a question about their origin is a good start. The answer should mention the mix of Norse and Frankish people.

Next, the term "Normans" in Latin is Nortmanni/Normanni. The user might ask for the original Latin term, so that's another question.

The Duchy of Normandy was established by the Treaty of Saint-Clair-sur-Epte. A question about when it was established would be appropriate, with the answer being the treaty date.

The Normans adopted the Gallo-Romance language, so a question about the language they spoke would fit here. The answer should mention Old Norman.

The Battle of Hastings in 1066 is a key event. The question could ask about the leader of the Normans in that battle, with William the Conqueror as the answer.

The Normans were known for their Catholic piety. A question about their religious affiliation would be relevant, with Christianity as the answer.

The Norman language evolved into Norman French, so a question about the origin of Norman French would be good. The answer should link it to Old Norman.

The Normans had a significant impact on medieval Europe. A question about their cultural and military influence would work, with the answer mentioning their contributions.

The Normans are associated with the Channel Islands. A question about their current status in the Channel Islands would be appropriate, noting they are Crown Dependencies.

Finally, the Normans are an ethnic group. A question about their classification would be straightforward, with the answer being EthnicGroup.

I need to ensure each question is unique and covers different aspects: origin, language, historical events, religious beliefs, cultural impact, geographical associations, and classification. Let me check the example given to make sure the format is correct, with each line in the CSV format as per the instructions.
