Alright, I need to create a CSV file with 10 question-answer pairs about Jacksonville, Florida based on the provided context and facts. The questions should be varied and cover different aspects of the city.

First, looking at the abstract, I see that Jacksonville is the most populous city in Florida, located in Duval County, with a population of around 949,611 as of 2020. It's also known for being consolidated with Duval County in 1968 and has nicknames like "The River City."

I'll start by creating questions about the population and its ranking. Then, I'll move on to geographical aspects, such as the river it straddles and nearby cities. Historical facts, like when it was founded and who it's named after, should be included. Transport infrastructure, sports teams based there, and notable people from Jacksonville are also good topics.

I need to ensure each question has a unique answer and isn't repetitive. I'll check the facts list for additional details, such as specific buildings, transportation routes, and events held in Jacksonville.

Let me structure each line with "pergunta;resposta" format, making sure not to exceed 10 pairs and keeping answers concise.
