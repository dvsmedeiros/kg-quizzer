Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the provided context about the IPCC. Let's start by carefully reading the context to identify key points.

First, the IPCC was established in 1988 by WMO and UNEP. That's a good starting point for a question. Then, the number of member states is 195. The secretariat is in Geneva, Switzerland, hosted by WMO. The main function is advancing scientific knowledge on climate change from human activities. The assessment cycle is usually 6-7 years. The IPCC doesn't conduct original research but compiles findings from existing literature. The Nobel Peace Prize in 2007 was shared with Al Gore. The Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) was published in 2021, with the Synthesis Report in March 2023. The special reports include the 1.5°C report in 2018. The role of the bureau is selecting experts. The reports cover physical science, impacts, adaptation, and mitigation. The IPCC's authority is international, endorsed by member governments.

Now, I need to form questions that cover these points. Each answer should be concise, under 10 words. Let's make sure each question is specific and directly relates to the context. For example, "Quantos países são membros do IPCC?" would have the answer "195 países." I'll check each point to ensure no important details are missed. Also, need to avoid repeating the same type of question. Make sure the answers are accurate and in Portuguese. Finally, format the CSV correctly with semicolons and the header row.
