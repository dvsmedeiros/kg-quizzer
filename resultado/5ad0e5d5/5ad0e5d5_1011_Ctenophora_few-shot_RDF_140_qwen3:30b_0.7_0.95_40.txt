Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs in Portuguese based on the given context about Ctenophora. Let me start by reading through the context carefully to understand the key points.

First, the context mentions that Ctenophora are a phylum of marine invertebrates, commonly known as comb jellies. They use cilia for swimming, called "combs." Their size ranges from a few millimeters to 1.5 meters. There are around 100-150 validated species. They have a jelly-like body with a two-cell thick layer. They are predators, eating various small organisms. Some fossils date back to the Cambrian period. Their classification in the tree of life is debated, with hypotheses like the Ctenophora Sister Hypothesis.

Now, I need to make sure each question is unique and covers different aspects. Let me list possible topics: definition, common name, swimming mechanism, size, body structure, diet, fossils, classification debates, examples of species, and the origin of the name.

I should avoid repeating questions. For example, the size is mentioned twice in the example, but I need to phrase it differently. Also, check that answers are short, under 10 words, and based on the context. Let me go through each point.

1. What is Ctenophora? Answer: Phylum of marine invertebrates (comb jellies).
2. Common name? Answer: Comb jellies.
3. How do they swim? Answer: Using cilia (combs).
4. Size range? Answer: 1.5 m (5 ft) max.
5. Body structure? Answer: Jelly mass with two-cell layer.
6. Diet? Answer: Predators, eat small organisms.
7. Fossil age? Answer: 525 million years (Cambrian).
8. Classification debate? Answer: Sister group to sponges or earlier than them.
9. Examples of species? Answer: Cydippids, beroids, etc.
10. Origin of name? Answer: Greek "comb" and "carry."

Wait, the example had "Ctenophora" in Greek, so maybe that's a good question. Also, check for unique phrasing. Ensure answers are concise. Let me verify each answer against the context to make sure they're correct and not inferred beyond the given info. Avoid any markdown, just CSV format. Make sure there are exactly 10 lines. Alright, time to put them together.
