First, I should parse each line to identify the subject, predicate, and object. The lines are in the format: subject predicate object. But some lines have multiple objects separated by commas. For example, "ns2:causalties "1,500 died of wounds", "1,512 killed in action" ;" has two objects. So I need to split those correctly.
I need to make sure that each row in the CSV corresponds to a single subject-predicate-object triple. If a predicate has multiple objects, each should be a separate row. Also, some lines might have multiple predicates, like "ns2:combatant "Algonquin", "Cherokee Nation(before 1758)", "WyandotofOhio Country" ;" which has three objects for the same predicate.
For example, the line "ns2:causalties "1,500 died of wounds", "1,512 killed in action" ;" would split into subject: ns2:causalties, predicate: "1,500 died of wounds", "1,512 killed in action", but I need to parse the objects correctly. Wait, actually, the structure is subject predicate object. So the subject is "ns2:causalties", the predicate is "1,500 died of wounds", but that doesn't make sense. Wait, no. Let me check again.
Subject: "ns2:causalties", predicate: "1,500 died of wounds", object: "1,512 killed in action"? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe the subject is the same as the previous line, but the way the data is written is a bit ambiguous. Wait, looking at the data, the lines are part of the same resource. For example, the line "http://dbpedia.org/resource/French_and_Indian_War a <http://schema.org/Event>, <http://umbel.org/umbel/rc/Event> ;" is the start of the resource, and then subsequent lines are other properties of the same resource. So the subject is "http://dbpedia.org/resource/French_and_Indian_War" for all the lines that follow.
Then, the next line has "ns2:causalties "1,500 died of wounds", "1,512 killed in action" ;" which would be the same subject, predicate "ns2:causalties", and two objects.
But in the data provided, the lines are not always starting with the subject. For example, the line "ns2:causalties "1,500 died of wounds", "1,512 killed in action" ;" starts with the predicate, not the subject. So I need to assume that the subject is the same as the previous line, unless a new subject is specified.
But in the data provided, the lines are not properly separated. For example, the line "ns2:causalties "1,500 died of wounds", "1,512 killed in action" ;" is a continuation of the same subject.
But parsing this requires handling the syntax, which can be complex. For example, the line "ns2:causalties "1,500 died of wounds", "1,512 killed in action" ;" would have the subject as the previous one, predicate "ns2:causalties", and objects "1,500 died of wounds" and "1,512 killed in action".
Similarly, the line "ns2:combatant "Algonquin", "Cherokee Nation(before 1758)", "WyandotofOhio Country" ;" would have three objects.
But looking at the user's input, the data is provided in a way where lines are continued with spaces. For example, the first line has a line break after "Event> ;" and the next line starts with "ns2:causalties".
So, for a line like "ns2:causalties "1,500 died of wounds", "1,512 killed in action" ;", the predicate is "ns2:causalties", and the objects are "1,500 died of wounds" and "1,512 killed in action".
Similarly, for a line like "ns2:combatant "Algonquin", "Cherokee Nation(before 1758)", "WyandotofOhio Country" ;", three rows.
