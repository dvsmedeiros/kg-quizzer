Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the provided context about the 1973 oil crisis. Let me start by understanding the context and the facts given.

The context mentions that the 1973 oil crisis began in October 1973 with an embargo by OAPEC members, led by Saudi Arabia, targeting nations that supported Israel during the Yom Kippur War. The embargo affected countries like Canada, Japan, the Netherlands, UK, US, and later extended to others. By March 1974, oil prices rose nearly 300%, from $3 to $12 per barrel. The crisis was called the "first oil shock," followed by the 1979 crisis as the "second oil shock."

The facts include RDF triples, but the main info is in the context. I need to ensure the questions are varied and cover different aspects: start date, countries targeted, price changes, causes, effects, duration, terminology, key players, and related events.

Let me brainstorm possible questions:

1. When did the 1973 oil crisis start? → October 1973
2. Which countries were initially targeted? → Canada, Japan, Netherlands, UK, US
3. What was the oil price increase by March 1974? → 300% increase
4. Why did OAPEC impose the embargo? → Targeting nations supporting Israel
5. What was another name for the crisis? → First oil shock
6. Who led the embargo? → Saudi Arabia (OAPEC members)
7. How did the embargo affect global prices? → Prices rose to $12 per barrel
8. When did the embargo end? → March 1974
9. What was the impact on the economy? → Oil crisis with long-term effects
10. What followed the first oil shock? → Second oil shock in 1979

Now, I need to phrase these into concise questions and answers, ensuring they are unique and fit the format. Let me check for repetition and ensure answers are derived directly from the context. Also, make sure the answers are short, up to 10 words. Let me structure each line as per the example, using semicolons.
