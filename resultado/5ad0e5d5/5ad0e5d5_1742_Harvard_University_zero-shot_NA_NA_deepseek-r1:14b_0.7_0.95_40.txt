Okay, I need to create a CSV with 10 question-answer pairs about Harvard University based on the provided context. Let me go through the context carefully and identify key points.

First, I'll note that Harvard was founded in 1636 as Harvard College. That's a good fact for a question. Next, its location is Cambridge, Massachusetts. Also important is who it was named after, John Harvard, a Puritan clergyman.

Harvard is part of the Ivy League and is the oldest institution of higher learning in the US. It's also one of the most prestigious. The endowment is mentioned as $50.9 billion, the largest in the world. This could be another question.

The university comprises ten academic faculties plus Harvard Radcliffe Institute. The Faculty of Arts and Sciences offers a wide range of undergraduate and graduate disciplines, while other faculties focus on graduate degrees only. This might be too detailed for a question, but perhaps about the number of faculties.

Harvard has three main campuses: Cambridge, Allston, and Longwood Medical Area in Boston. That's a good point for a question.

Libraries are another key aspect; Harvard Library is the largest academic library system with 79 libraries and about 20.4 million items. The founding was authorized by Massachusetts' colonial legislature because they were concerned about an illiterate ministry. This historical context can form a question.

The curriculum and student body became more secular during the 18th century. Harvard emerged as prominent among Boston's elite in the 19th century. Under Charles William Eliot, it developed into a modern research university after the Civil War.

James B. Conant led through the Great Depression and WWII, liberalizing admissions post-war. This could be another question about leadership during tough times.

Harvard alumni have achieved significant success: eight US presidents, 188 living billionaires (most of any university), many Nobel laureates, Fields Medalists, etc. Also, they've founded notable companies.

Students and alumni have won 10 Academy Awards, 48 Pulitzer Prizes, and 110 Olympic medals. This is impressive and can be a question about achievements.

I should structure each question to target these points without being too vague. Each answer should be concise, up to 10 words. I'll make sure the CSV format uses semicolons as separators and starts with "pergunta;resposta".

Let me list out possible questions:

1. When was Harvard University founded?
2. In which US state is Harvard located?
3. For whom is Harvard named?
4. What makes Harvard the oldest higher learning institution in the US?
5. How many academic faculties does Harvard have, including its affiliate?
6. Which river divides Harvard's Cambridge and Allston campuses?
7. What is Harvard's endowment amount?
8. What significant historical reason led to Harvard's founding?
9. Who was a key president during Harvard's transformation into a research university?
10. How many Olympic medals have Harvard alumni won?

Wait, the context says 46 gold medals, but the question mentions 110 total. I'll include that.

I think these cover the main points without overlapping too much. Let me make sure each answer is accurate and concise.
