Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the provided context and facts. First, I need to parse all the given information to extract key points.

The main context is about British Satellite Broadcasting (BSB), its establishment in 1986, headquarters in London, merger with Sky Television in 1990 to form BSkyB, and its role in satellite TV. The facts include various categories, models, subsidiaries, and other details.

Now, I need to create varied questions. Starting with the founding year and location, which are directly from the context. Then, the merger details. Next, the types of companies, categories they belong to, subsidiaries, channels owned, and models used.

I need to ensure each question has a unique answer derived from the facts. For example, "Quando BSB foi fundado?" uses the fact that it was founded in 1986. Another question could be about the merger date and the resulting company.

I should check for repetition. Avoid asking similar questions about the same topic. Also, make sure answers are concise, under 10 words. For example, "Sky UK" as the successor, "1990" as the merger year.

Looking at the facts, there are multiple categories, so questions about those can be made. Also, the channels owned by BSB, like Galaxy and The Movie Channel. Models used, such as Template:Infobox company.

Need to make sure all answers are directly from the provided data and not inferred beyond that. Double-check each fact against the given information. Finally, format the CSV correctly with semicolons and no markdown.
