Looking at the triples, there are various entities linked to economic inequality, like books, movements, and scholars. However, the user examples focus more on statistics and specific data points, even though the context here doesn't include numbers like those in the Oxfam examples. Wait, the context here is different; it's more about the general concepts and effects rather than specific statistics. So I need to make sure the questions are based on the information in the context provided, not the Oxfam examples from the user's initial message.
