Okay, the user wants me to create 10 pairs of questions and answers based on the provided content about Normans. Let me look through the given text.

First, I notice that there are several entities mentioned like "Normans," "Normannia," and specific castles. Each of these has associated facts, such as nationalities, languages, languages spoken, military actions, and historical events.

I should make sure each question is relevant and connects to a single answer. For example, the Normans had their own language, so I can create a question about that and another about their history.

I also need to ensure that each entry in the CSV follows the correct format: name;answer. The user provided an example with 10 lines, so I'll follow that structure but make sure none of the names or answers repeat.

Let me list out possible questions:

1. What language did Normans speak?
2. How were Normans educated historically?
3. Mention a key castle and its significance.
4. Name a famous battle and associated events.
5. Discuss a notable figure, like an onionist, since that's in the text.
6. List a few Normans' achievements or traditions.
7. Note when they emerged from the Duchy of Normandy.

Wait, I think some of these might be too broad or not unique enough. For example, mentioning a famous battle is good, but listing more specific questions could help meet the 10 count. Also, ensuring that each question covers different aspects like nationalities, languages, castles, history, etc., would make the CSV diverse.

I'll create 10 distinct questions, making sure each one is concise and has a unique focus to avoid repetition. Let me draft them now, keeping in mind the format and rules.
