Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs in Portuguese based on the given context about British Satellite Broadcasting (BSB). Let me start by reviewing the context and the facts provided.

First, the context says BSB was a TV company in London, started broadcasting in March 1990, and merged with Sky Television in November 1990 to form BSkyB. The facts include various types, locations, mergers, and related entities.

I need to make sure each question is unique and covers different aspects. Let me list possible topics: founding year, merger, headquarters, services, related channels, company types, etc.

For example, one question could be about the founding year. The facts mention BSB was founded in 1986. Another could be about the merger date. The context states the merger was on 2 November 1990. 

I should check if the answers are directly from the context. For instance, the headquarters is London. The services provided were direct broadcast satellite TV. The merged company is British Sky Broadcasting. 

I need to avoid repetition. Let me think of different angles: location, services, merger details, company type, related channels, etc. Also, check for any specific facts like the logo image or specific channels owned.

Wait, some facts mention "Heil Honey I'm Home!" as a company of type BSB. But the context doesn't mention that, so maybe that's from the triples. However, the user said to use the context, triples, and examples. So maybe that's acceptable.

I need to ensure answers are short, up to 10 words. For example, "Quando a BSB começou a transmitir?" with answer "25 de março de 1990".

Let me draft 10 questions:

1. Quando a BSB começou a transmitir? (25 de março de 1990)
2. Onde a BSB estava localizada? (Londres)
3. O que a BSB oferecia? (serviços de televisão por satélite direta)
4. Quando a BSB se fundiu com a Sky Television? (2 de novembro de 1990)
5. Qual foi a empresa resultante da fusão? (British Sky Broadcasting)
6. Qual o tipo de empresa da BSB? (empresa de mídia)
7. Quais canais eram propriedade da BSB? (The Power Station, Now, The Movie Channel, Galaxy)
8. Qual o ano de fundação da BSB? (1986)
9. Qual o modelo de página usado pela BSB? (Template:Infobox company)
10. O que a BSB foi sucedida por? (Sky UK)

Wait, some answers might need to be checked. For example, the model page is mentioned as Template:Infobox company. Also, the answer for the merger is "British Sky Broadcasting" as per the context.

I need to make sure each answer is correct and concise. Let me verify each one against the context and facts provided. For example, the headquarters is London, the services are direct broadcast satellite, the merger date is 2 November 1990, and the resulting company is BSkyB.

Yes, that should cover 10 unique questions without repetition.
