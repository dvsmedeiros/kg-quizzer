Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the provided context and facts. Let me start by understanding the context. The context defines imperialism as a state policy involving extending power through territorial acquisition or political/economic control, using both hard and soft power. It's distinct from colonialism and empire but related.

Looking at the facts, there are a lot of entries about different aspects, like models used in Wikipedia, images, political parties with imperialism as an ideology, and various historical events linked to imperialism. I need to make sure the questions are varied and not repetitive, and each answer is directly inferable from the context or facts.

First, I'll list possible questions. For example, the definition of imperialism is given, so a question about its main purpose could be "What is the main purpose of imperialism?" with the answer "Extending power and dominion." 

Next, the context mentions imperialism is distinct from colonialism and empire. A question could be "How is imperialism distinct from colonialism?" Answer: "Distinct concept with different forms of expansion."

Looking at the facts, there are several political parties with imperialism as an ideology. A question could be "Which Canadian political party has imperialism as an ideology?" Answer: "Canadian Party."

The context also mentions both hard and soft power. A question might be "What powers does imperialism use?" Answer: "Hard and soft power."

There are images related to different empires, so a question could be "What is an example of an image representing imperialism?" Answer: "Roman Empire Map.png."

Another fact is about the Japanese Empire's image. A question like "Which empire's image is associated with imperialism?" Answer: "Japanese Empire."

The context states imperialism is a type of advocacy. A question could be "What type of advocacy is imperialism?" Answer: "State policy and practice."

There's mention of the Mongol Empire's expansion. A question: "Which empire's expansion is linked to imperialism?" Answer: "Mongol Empire."

The facts include cultural works related to imperialism, like "Culture and Imperialism." A question: "Which book treats the subject of imperialism?" Answer: "Culture and Imperialism."

Lastly, the context mentions the use of models like Template:Politics. A question: "What Wikipedia model is used for imperialism?" Answer: "Template:Politics."

I need to ensure each answer is concise, under 10 words, and that the questions are unique. Let me check for repetition and adjust as needed. Also, make sure the CSV format uses semicolons and only the required 10 lines.
