Okay, the user wants me to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the provided context about Victoria, Australia. Let me start by reading through the context carefully to identify key points.

First, I need to make sure each question is relevant and the answers are concise, up to 10 words. The separator is a semicolon, so I'll use that. Let me list out the main facts from the context:

- Victoria is a state in southeastern Australia.
- Second-smallest state with 227,444 km² area.
- Second most populated after NSW, over 6.5 million people.
- Most densely populated state (28 per km²).
- Borders NSW (north), SA (west), Bass Strait (south), Great Australian Bight (southwest), Tasman Sea (southeast).
- Climates range from temperate coastal to semi-arid northwest.
- Population concentrated in central-south around Port Phillip Bay, especially Greater Melbourne.
- Four of Australia's 20 largest cities: Melbourne, Geelong, Ballarat, Bendigo.
- 35.1% immigrants, many Aboriginal groups, 30+ languages before colonization.
- History with Cook, New South Wales colony, first settlement in 1803, Port Phillip District in 1836, became a separate colony in 1851, responsible government in 1855.
- Gold rush in 1850s-60s boosted population and wealth.
- Melbourne was largest city in Australasia, federal capital until 1927.
- Economy is second-largest, diversified, service sectors dominate.
- Government structure: Legislative Assembly and Council, Labor Party led by Daniel Andrews since 2014.
- Governor is Linda Dessau.
- 79 local government areas, some unincorporated.

Now, I need to form questions from these points. Let me make sure each question is unique and covers different aspects. For example:

1. What is Victoria's population density? (Answer: 28 per km²)
2. Which city is Victoria's capital? (Melbourne)
3. What is the land area of Victoria? (227,444 km²)
4. Which countries border Victoria? (NSW, SA, Bass Strait, etc.)
5. What is the largest city in Victoria? (Melbourne)
6. How many seats does Victoria have in the House of Representatives? (38)
7. When was Victoria established as a separate colony? (1851)
8. What was the impact of the gold rush? (Boosted population and wealth)
9. What is Victoria's economy based on? (Service sectors)
10. Who is the current Governor of Victoria? (Linda Dessau)

Wait, some answers might be a bit longer. Need to check if they fit within 10 words. Let me adjust:

For question 4, maybe rephrase to "Which states and bodies of water border Victoria?" and answer "NSW, SA, Bass Strait, Great Bight, Tasman Sea."

Also, ensure all answers are concise. Let me verify each answer's length. Once that's done, format them into CSV with semicolons.
