Okay, the user wants me to generate 10 question-answer pairs in Portuguese based on the given context about Harvard University. Let me start by reading the context carefully to extract key points.

First, I need to make sure each question is relevant to the context. The answer should be concise, up to 10 words. The format is CSV with semicolons. Let me think of different aspects of Harvard mentioned in the text.

The context mentions Harvard's founding in 1636 as Harvard College, named after John Harvard. That's a good point for a question. Then there's the endowment value, the campuses, the library system, the number of Nobel laureates, and famous alumni. Also, the number of campuses is three, and the endowment per student is fifth in the US. 

I need to make sure each question is clear and the answer is a short phrase. Let me check the example given. For instance, "Quando foi fundada a Harvard University?" with "1636" as the answer. That works.

I should avoid repeating the same type of questions. Let me list possible topics: founding year, name origin, number of campuses, endowment value, library size, Nobel laureates, alumni with billionaires, Turing Award laureates, Olympic medals, and the first benefactor. 

Wait, the context says "Harvard has three main campuses," so that's a question. The endowment is $50.9 billion, making it the wealthiest. The library has 79 libraries with 20.4 million items. The number of Nobel laureates among alumni is mentioned, but the exact number isn't given. Wait, the text says "numerous heads of state and U.S. presidents, Nobel laureates..." but not a specific number. Maybe I should avoid that. 

Wait, the context says "Harvard alumni include eight U.S. presidents and 188 living billionaires," so that's a good question. Also, "Fourteen Turing Award laureates have been Harvard affiliates." 

I need to ensure answers are short. For example, "Qual é o valor da dívida da Harvard?" but the context says "endowment" which is a financial reserve, not debt. So the answer would be "50,9 bilhões de dólares." 

Another point: "Harvard Library is the world's largest academic library system, comprising 79 individual libraries holding about 20.4 million items." So the answer is "79 bibliotecas; 20,4 milhões de itens." But the user wants each answer to be up to 10 words. So maybe "79 bibliotecas com 20,4 milhões de itens."

I need to check each question for clarity and that the answer is accurate. Also, make sure the questions are in Portuguese. Let me draft each pair now, ensuring they are distinct and cover different parts of the context.
