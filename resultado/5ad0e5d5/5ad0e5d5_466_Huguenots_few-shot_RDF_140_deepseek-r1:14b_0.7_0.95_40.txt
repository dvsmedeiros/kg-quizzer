Okay, I need to create a quiz with 10 question-response pairs based on the provided context about the Huguenots. Let me go through this step by step.

First, I'll read the context carefully to understand the key points. The Huguenots were French Protestants following Calvinism. They faced persecution and conflicts in France, leading to their decline under Louis XIV with the Edict of Fontainebleau. Key events include the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre, the Wars of Religion, and the eventual revocation of their rights.

Looking at the example provided, each question has a specific focus, like locations, dates, key figures, terms, and events. I should aim for similar variety but ensure no repetition.

I'll start by identifying main topics: origins, demographics, geography, conflicts, key leaders, treaties, terminology, historical impacts, and religious practices.

For questions:
1. Origin of the term "Huguenote" – mentioned as related to a Swiss leader.
2. Concentration areas in France – southern and central parts.
3. Proportion at the peak – around 10% before persecution.
4. Duration of the Wars of Religion – from 1562 to 1598.
5. Ending treaty – Edict of Nantes, granting autonomy.
6. Term's origin for mockery – Huguenote started as a term of derision.
7. Related Swiss figure – Besançon Hugues.
8. Calvinist center in Switzerland – Geneva.
9. Conspiracies against the Guise – Amboise conspiracy.
10. Dragonnades' effect – significant reduction in Huguenot numbers.

Now, I'll structure each question to target these points and ensure the answers are concise and accurate based on the context. I need to avoid similar questions and cover a broad range of aspects related to the Huguenots.
