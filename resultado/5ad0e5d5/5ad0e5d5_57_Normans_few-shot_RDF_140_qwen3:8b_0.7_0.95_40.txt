Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the provided context and facts about the Normans. Let me start by understanding the context and the facts given.

First, the context talks about the Normans originating from the Duchy of Normandy, their mix of Norse Vikings and Frankish/Gallo-Roman people, their expansion into England, Sicily, and other regions, their language, religion, and cultural impact. The facts include various RDF triples, which might be useful for specific details.

The user wants 10 unique questions with short answers, each in Portuguese, separated by semicolons. The answers should be derived from the context or facts. I need to avoid repeating questions and ensure they are varied.

Let me brainstorm possible questions. 

1. Where did the Normans originate from? Answer: Duchy of Normandy.
2. What language did they adopt? Answer: French/Gallo-Roman.
3. When did they gain their identity? Answer: 10th century.
4. Who was their leader in the Battle of Hastings? Answer: William the Conqueror.
5. What religion did they convert to? Answer: Christianity.
6. Which countries are remnants of their territory today? Answer: Channel Islands.
7. What was their original language? Answer: Old Norse.
8. Who was the first Duke of Normandy? Answer: Rollo.
9. What was their impact on Europe? Answer: Political, cultural, military.
10. What is the modern name for their dialect? Answer: Norman French.

Wait, need to check if these answers are accurate based on the context. For example, the origin is the Duchy of Normandy, which matches the context. The Battle of Hastings leader is William the Conqueror. They adopted French, as mentioned. The Channel Islands are remnants. The original language is Old Norse, which is in the facts. Rollo was the first Duke. Their impact is mentioned as political, cultural, military. The dialect is Norman French.

I should make sure each answer is concise and directly from the text. Also, translate the questions into Portuguese. Let me verify each point again to ensure correctness. Once that's done, format them as CSV with semicolons and ensure no duplicates.
