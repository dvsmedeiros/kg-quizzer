Okay, so I need to create a quiz based on knowledge about the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The user provided some context about what IPCC does and its history, which is helpful. 

First, I should figure out what key facts or topics are relevant to include in the quiz. From the context, important areas might be when IPCC was established, who formed it, its current members, major reports, assessment cycles, special reports like the 1.5°C report, and updates on methodologies.

I need to structure each question with a relevant question and a correct answer. The questions should cover both factual information and perhaps some in-depth knowledge about IPCC's role or recent changes. I should make sure each response is concise but accurate based on the provided context.

Let me start by listing possible questions:

1. Who formed the IPCC? This relates to the history section.
2. When was it established? That ties into the establishment part.
3. What are the current member states of IPCC? This covers recent membership.
4. Which reports does IPCC conduct, like the 1.5°C report?
5. How many assessment cycles have there been so far and when are they coming up?

I should make sure each answer is clear and directly related to the context provided. Also, I need to separate them by a semicolon in the CSV format as specified.

Wait, for question 4, it mentions "major reports" but doesn't specify which ones. Since the context talks about working groups and task forces, I'll include that information without making the answer too long.

I should avoid any questions that are too vague or require external knowledge beyond what's provided in the context. Keeping each question focused on facts will make the quiz more effective.

Let me double-check to ensure all questions fall within the range of 10 and that they correctly pair with answers based on the structure.
