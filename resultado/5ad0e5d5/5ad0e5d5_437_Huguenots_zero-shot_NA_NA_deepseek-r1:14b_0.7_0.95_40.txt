Okay, I need to generate a CSV file with 10 pairs of questions and answers based on the provided context about the Huguenots. The user has given specific instructions, so I should make sure I follow them carefully.

First, I'll read through the context again to understand the key points. The Huguenots were French Protestants following Calvinism, their origins in the 16th century, conflicts with Catholics leading to the French Wars of Religion, and significant events like the Edict of Nantes, persecution under Louis XIV, and later developments.

I need to create questions that are relevant to this context. Each question should have a short, correct answer. The language must be Portuguese, and each line in the CSV should separate the question and answer with a semicolon.

Let me brainstorm some possible questions:

1. When was the term "Huguenot" first commonly used?
2. What percentage of the French population were Huguenots before 1600?
3. Who led the Huguenots during the French Wars of Religion?
4. Which king revoked Protestant rights with the Edict of Fontainebleau?
5. What was the purpose of the dragonnades?
6. How did the Huguenot population decrease under Louis XIV?
7. What ended legal recognition of Protestantism in France?
8. When were Protestants granted equal rights in France?
9. Which event marked the end of persecution of Protestants?
10. What was the name of Henry IV's mother who supported the Huguenots?

Now, I'll ensure each answer is concise and accurate based on the context provided. For example, the first question's answer would be "meados do século XVI" since that's when the term became common.

I should double-check each fact to make sure it aligns with the given text. Once all questions and answers are ready, I'll format them into a CSV without any additional explanations or markdown.
