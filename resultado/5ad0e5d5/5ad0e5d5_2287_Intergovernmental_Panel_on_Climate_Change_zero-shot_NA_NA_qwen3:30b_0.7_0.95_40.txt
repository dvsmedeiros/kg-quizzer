Okay, the user wants me to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the provided context about the IPCC. Let me start by reading through the context carefully to understand the key points.

First, the IPCC is a UN body established in 1988 by WMO and UNEP. It has 195 member states, and they elect a bureau of scientists. The reports are prepared by experts nominated by governments and organizations. There are three working groups and a task force. The IPCC doesn't do original research but compiles existing literature. They produce Assessment Reports, which are crucial for climate negotiations. The Sixth Assessment Report was completed in 2023, with parts released in 2021 and 2022. They also have special reports like the 1.5°C report. The Nobel Prize in 2007 was shared with Al Gore. The secretariat is in Geneva, hosted by WMO. The sixth cycle is the most ambitious.

Now, I need to create 10 questions. Let me brainstorm possible questions. For example, when was the IPCC established? What's the role of the secretariat? How many member states? What are the three working groups? What's the purpose of the Assessment Reports? When was the Sixth Assessment Report completed? What special reports were mentioned? Who hosts the secretariat? What's the main function of the IPCC? What was the Nobel Prize in 2007 for?

I need to make sure each answer is concise, under 10 words. Let me check each answer. For instance, "When was the IPCC established?" answer is "1988." That's good. "What is the role of the secretariat?" "Hosts the IPCC's operations in Geneva." Wait, the context says the secretariat is in Geneva, hosted by WMO. So maybe "Hosted by WMO in Geneva." But the user wants short answers. Maybe "Hosted by WMO in Geneva." That's 5 words.

Another question: "How many member states does the IPCC have?" Answer: "195 member states." That's correct. "What are the three working groups?" The context mentions three working groups and a task force, but the names aren't given. Wait, the context says "three working groups and a task force," but doesn't list them. Hmm, maybe I should avoid that. Let me check again. The context says "The IPCC has three working groups and a task force, which carry out its scientific work." But the names aren't specified. So maybe that's not a good question. Let me think of another. Maybe "What is the main function of the IPCC?" Answer: "Advances scientific knowledge on climate change." That's from the context.

Another question: "When was the Sixth Assessment Report completed?" Answer: "2023." The context says it's due to conclude in March 2023, so that's correct. "What special report was released in 2018?" "Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C." Yes. "Who shared the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize with the IPCC?" "Al Gore." Correct. "What does the IPCC not conduct?" "Original research." Yes. "What is the purpose of the Assessment Reports?" "Inform governments about climate change knowledge." That's from the context.

I need to ensure all answers are under 10 words. Let me check each one. "Hosted by WMO in Geneva" – 5 words. "195 member states" – 2 words. "Advances scientific knowledge on climate change" – 6 words. "2023" – 1. "Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C" – 7. "Al Gore" – 1. "Original research" – 2. "Inform governments about climate change knowledge" – 7. "What is the main function of the IPCC?" – "Advances scientific knowledge on climate change." That's good. "What is the role of the secretariat?" "Hosted by WMO in Geneva." Yes.

I think that's 10 pairs. Let me list them out in CSV format as specified.
