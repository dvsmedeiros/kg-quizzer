Okay, I need to create a quiz based on semântica. The user provided an example and context about Islamism. Let me see.

First, the user wants 10 pairs pergunta/resposta in CSV format, separated by semántica or similar words. They used "pergunta;resposta" as separators. I need to make sure each line starts with a question, followed by its answer. The language must be portuguese and split into two columns.

The context is about Islamism, so the questions should relate to that ideology. Let me think of key points from the context.

1. What does Islamism mean? It's a political ideology advocating state power, sharia principles, or community unity.
2. Which countries are often referred to as Muslim states in this ideology?
3. How do Islamist movements differ from Western neocolonialism and Islamism?
4. Who are the key figures in 20th-century Islamism, like Sayyid Rashid Rida or Hassan al-Banna?
5. What is the difference between Islamic Movement and Islamic Activity?
6. Is Qutb's support for violence typical of his movements?
7. How has the term Islamism evolved after the Arab Spring?
8. Are there other forms of Islamism besides the one in this context?
9. Who are the main groups in ISIL, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant?
10. What does it mean for an individual to be Muslim within this ideology?

Now, I'll structure each question with a clear answer, using the semântica or related words. Make sure each line is correct and separated by a semántica.
