Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs in Portuguese based on the given context about oxygen. Let me start by reading through the context and the facts provided to make sure I understand the key points.

The context mentions that oxygen has an atomic number of 8, is a chalcogen, forms oxides, is the most abundant element on Earth, makes up 20.95% of the atmosphere, is involved in photosynthesis, and has various uses. There are also facts about its discovery by Priestley, Lavoisier, and others, as well as its allotropes like ozone.

I need to make sure each question is unique and covers different aspects. Let me brainstorm possible questions:

1. Atomic number of oxygen? (Answer: 8)
2. What group is oxygen in? (Answer: chalcogen)
3. Main component of Earth's atmosphere? (Answer: 20.95% O2)
4. What is the most abundant element on Earth? (Answer: oxygen)
5. What is the formula for diatomic oxygen? (Answer: O2)
6. Who discovered oxygen? (Answers: Priestley, Scheele, Lavoisier)
7. What is ozone's formula? (Answer: O3)
8. What role does oxygen play in photosynthesis? (Answer: produced from water and CO2)
9. What is the primary use of oxygen in industry? (Answers: steel production, etc.)
10. What is the name of the gas that protects from UV? (Answer: ozone)

Wait, but the user wants short answers, up to 10 words. Let me check each answer to ensure they fit. For example, "O2" is short. Also, need to avoid repeating similar questions. Let me make sure each question is distinct and the answers are directly from the context.

I need to verify that each answer is inferable from the context. For instance, the atomic number is mentioned. The group is called chalcogen. The atmosphere percentage is 20.95%. The most abundant element on Earth is oxygen. Diatomic formula is O2. Discovery is attributed to Priestley, Scheele, and Lavoisier. Ozone is O3. Photosynthesis produces oxygen. Uses include steel, plastics, etc. Ozone protects from UV.

Now, structure each question in Portuguese, making sure they are clear and the answers are concise. Avoid any markdown and use semicolons. Let me draft the 10 pairs.
