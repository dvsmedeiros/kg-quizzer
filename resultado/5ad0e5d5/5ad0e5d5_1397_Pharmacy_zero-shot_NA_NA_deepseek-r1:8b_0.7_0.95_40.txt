Okay, so I need to create 10 question-answer pairs in Portuguese based on the given context about pharmacy. The questions should be relevant and each followed by a correct short answer, up to 10 words. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll read through the context carefully to identify key points that can form questions. The context talks about what pharmacy is, its scope, traditional roles like compounding medications, modern services like clinical pharmacy and drug information, and differences between community and institutional pharmacies.

I should make sure each question addresses a different aspect of the topic without repeating the same ideas. Let me list possible questions:

1. What is the primary goal of pharmacy practice?
2. Which setting includes direct patient care in pharmacies?
3. What is the traditional role of pharmacists beyond dispensing medications?
4. In which country are chemists more commonly referred to as pharmacies?
5. What do modern pharmacies offer besides medication sales?
6. What is considered a precursor to modern sciences related to pharmacy?
7. How does community pharmacy differ from institutional pharmacy in terms of services?
8. Who are the primary experts on drug therapy?
9. What ensures the safe and effective use of medications?
10. Which term refers to an establishment where pharmacy is practiced, especially in the US?

Now I'll draft the answers based on these questions. Each answer should be concise, around 5-10 words.

1. The primary goal is ensuring safe, effective, and affordable medication use.
2. Clinical pharmacy occurs in both community and institutional settings.
3. Compounding medications is a traditional role of pharmacists.
4. In Great Britain, they are called chemists.
5. Modern pharmacies offer clinical services and health care reviews.
6. The apothecary's work was a precursor to modern chemistry and pharmacology.
7. Community pharmacies focus on patient care, while institutional ones manage inpatient medications.
8. Pharmacists are the primary experts on drug therapy.
9. Ensuring safe use is done through reviewing medications.
10. In the US, such establishments are called pharmacies.

I think these cover a good range of topics from the context and provide clear, concise answers. Now I'll format them as per the instructions, separating each pair with a semicolon.
