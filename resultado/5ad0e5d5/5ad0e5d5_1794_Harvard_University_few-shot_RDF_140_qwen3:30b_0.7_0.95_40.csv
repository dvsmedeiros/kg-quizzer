But without specific instructions on how to structure the CSV, it's a bit challenging. However, looking at the example given in the user's data, there's a line that ends with "ns1:type <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Private_university> ;" and "ns2:sportingAffiliations <http://dbpedia.org/resource/NCAA_Division_I> .". So for the subject "Harvard_University", the type is "Private_university" and the sporting affiliation is "NCAA_Division_I".
