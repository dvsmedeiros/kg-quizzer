Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs in Portuguese based on the given context about Ctenophora. Let me start by reading through the context carefully to understand the key points.

First, the context mentions that Ctenophora is a phylum of marine invertebrates known as comb jellies. They use cilia for swimming, called "combs." The size ranges from a few millimeters to 1.5 meters. There are 100-150 validated species. They have different body forms like cydippids, platyctenids, and beroids. Most are predators, but some juveniles are parasites. Fossils date back to the Cambrian period. The debate about their position in the tree of life is mentioned, with hypotheses like the Ctenophora Sister Hypothesis.

Now, I need to create questions and short answers. Each answer should be up to 10 words. Let me think of different aspects: characteristics, classification, size, body forms, diet, fossils, classification debates, etc.

1. What is the common name for Ctenophora? Answer: Comb jellies.
2. What do they use for swimming? Answer: Cilia (combs).
3. How many species are validated? Answer: 100 to 150.
4. What is the largest size? Answer: 1.5 meters.
5. What are the main body forms? Answer: Cydippids, platyctenids, beroids.
6. What do they eat? Answer: Microscopic larvae to crustaceans.
7. Do any live as parasites? Answer: Juveniles of two species.
8. When do fossils appear? Answer: Early Cambrian, 525 million years.
9. What's the debate about their classification? Answer: Ctenophora Sister Hypothesis.
10. What's the structure of their body? Answer: Jelly mass with two-cell layers.

Wait, let me check if the answers are concise. For example, "Comb jellies" is correct. "Cilia (combs)" is okay. "100 to 150" is short. "1.5 meters" is correct. The body forms are listed. Diet is correct. Parasites part is correct. Fossils in Cambrian. The debate is about the hypothesis. The body structure answer is accurate. I think these are all within the word limit. Now, format them as CSV with semicolons.
