Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs in Portuguese based on the provided context about the Black Death. Let me start by reading through the context carefully to identify key points.

First, the Black Death occurred from 1346 to 1353, so I can make a question about the time period. Then, it's mentioned as the most fatal pandemic, causing 75-200 million deaths. That's a good fact for a question on death toll.

The cause is Yersinia pestis, spread by fleas and through person-to-person contact. Maybe a question on the cause. The origin is disputed, with possible locations in Central or East Asia, and then spreading via the Golden Horde to Crimea. That could be a question about origin.

The spread via Genoese ships to the Mediterranean and North Africa. Another question on transmission routes. The 30-60% death rate in Europe, and the impact on population. Also, the recovery to pre-1300 levels by 1500. The second plague pandemic and the role of pneumonic plague in spreading inland.

There's a mention of Kyrgyzstan having deaths in the late 1330s, which challenges the Mongol conquest theory. Maybe a question on that. The Great Famine of 1315-1317 as the first disaster. The plague's recurrence until the 19th century. The reduction of world population from 475M to 350-375M.

I need to ensure each question is unique and covers different aspects. Let me check for repetition and ensure answers are directly from the context. Also, keep answers concise, under 10 words. Let me structure each pair now.
