Okay, the user wants me to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the provided context about Warsaw. Let me start by understanding the context thoroughly. The text gives a lot of details about Warsaw's history, population, geography, culture, and landmarks.

First, I need to identify key points that can be turned into questions. The context mentions the capital of Poland, population statistics, historical events like the World War II bombings, architectural landmarks, universities, and more. I should make sure each question is relevant and the answers are concise, under 10 words.

Let me brainstorm possible questions. For example, the capital of Poland is Warsaw, so a question about that. Then, the population figures. The historical events like the Ghetto Uprising and Warsaw Uprising. Architectural aspects like the Old Town being a World Heritage Site. Also, the airports, universities, and sports teams.

I need to check that each answer is accurate. For instance, the answer to "What is the capital of Poland?" should be "Warsaw". The population is 1.86 million. The Old Town is a World Heritage Site. The Warsaw Stock Exchange is the largest in Central/Eastern Europe. The tallest building is Varso Place. The main football club is Legia Warsaw. The National Philharmonic Orchestra is based there. The Royal Castle is a key historical site. The Warsaw Zoo is one of the largest in the country.

I should avoid repeating the same topics and ensure that each question is unique. Also, the answers need to be very short. Let me count to make sure there are 10. Let me check each one against the context again to ensure accuracy. Once that's done, format them into CSV with the correct separator.
