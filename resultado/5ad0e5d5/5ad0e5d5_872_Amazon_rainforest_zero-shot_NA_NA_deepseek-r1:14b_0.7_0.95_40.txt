Okay, I need to generate a CSV with 10 question-answer pairs based on the provided context about the Amazon rainforest. Let me start by carefully reading the context to extract key facts.

First, theAmazon rainforest covers most of the Amazon basin in South America, which spans 7 million square kilometers. Brazil has the largest portion, 60%, followed by Peru with 13% and Colombia with 10%. There are nine countries involved in total, including smaller parts in Bolivia, Ecuador, and others.

Next, there's mention of indigenous territories—3,344 formally acknowledged ones. The population includes over 30 million people from 350 ethnic groups, with 9% being Indigenous. Some tribes remain isolated.

The Amazon is known for its biodiversity, with 390 billion trees across 16,000 species. It's also the largest and most biodiverse tropical rainforest on Earth.

I should create questions that target these specific facts. Let me list potential questions:

1. What's the size of the Amazon basin? → 7 million km²
2. Which country has the largest part of the Amazon? → Brazil (60%)
3. How many countries does the Amazon span? → Nine
4. What is the main type of forest in the Amazon? → Moist broadleaf tropical rainforest
5. How many people live there? → Over 30 million
6. Which country has the second-largest portion? → Peru (13%)
7. How many Indigenous groups are isolated? → 60 groups
8. What's the total area of the Amazon rainforest? → 5.5 million km²
9. What's the name in French Guiana? → Guiana Amazonian Park
10. Total number of trees estimated → 390 billion

I need to phrase these as clear questions and ensure the answers are concise, up to 10 words each.

Now, I'll structure them into CSV format with semicolons separating the question and answer.
