Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the provided context and facts. Let me start by understanding the context. The context is about computational complexity theory, which classifies computational problems by their resource usage, like time and storage. It mentions related fields like analysis of algorithms and computability theory, and the P vs NP problem as a key example.

Looking at the facts, there are a lot of triples related to academics and their disciplines, but the main focus should be on the theory itself. The user wants questions that are varied and cover different aspects of the theory. Each question should have a concise answer, up to 10 words.

First, I'll identify key points from the context. The main idea is classifying problems by resource usage (time, storage), the role of computational complexity in determining practical limits, the P vs NP problem, and the distinction between analysis of algorithms and computational complexity.

I need to avoid repeating similar questions. Let me brainstorm possible questions:

1. What is the primary focus of computational complexity theory? (Answer: Classifying problems by resource usage)
2. What are the two main resources measured? (Time and storage)
3. What is the role of computational complexity theory? (Determine practical limits of computers)
4. What is a key question in the field? (P vs NP problem)
5. How does computational complexity differ from computability theory? (Restricts available resources)
6. What is a computational problem? (Task solved by a computer)
7. What models are used to quantify complexity? (Mathematical models of computation)
8. What is the main difference between analysis of algorithms and computational complexity? (Specific algorithm vs all possible algorithms)
9. What are the two related fields? (Analysis of algorithms and computability theory)
10. What does computational complexity theory try to classify? (Problems solvable with restricted resources)

Now, I need to phrase these as questions and ensure answers are concise. Let me check if each answer is directly inferable from the context. For example, the answer to the first question is in the first sentence. The two main resources are explicitly mentioned. The role is stated in the context. The P vs NP problem is mentioned as a Millennium Prize. The distinction between analysis and complexity is in the last paragraph. The two related fields are listed. The classification part is covered in the context.

I need to make sure the answers are short and in Portuguese. Let me translate and format them correctly, using semicolons as separators. Also, check for repetition and ensure each question is unique. Once that's done, I'll compile the CSV.
