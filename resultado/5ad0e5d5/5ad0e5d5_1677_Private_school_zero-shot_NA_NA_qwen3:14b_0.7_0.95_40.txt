Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the given context about private schools. Let me start by understanding the context thoroughly.

The context says that a private school is not administered or funded by the government, unlike public schools. They are not dependent on government funding, often have a board of governors, and have a governance system ensuring independence.

First, I'll identify key points from the context: definition of private school, contrast with public schools, funding sources, governance structure (board of governors), and independent operation.

Now, I need to create questions that cover these points. Let me think of possible questions:

1. What is a private school?
2. How does a private school differ from a public school?
3. Are private schools funded by the government?
4. What is the role of a board of governors in private schools?
5. Do private schools have independent governance?
6. What ensures the independent operation of private schools?
7. Can private schools be government-owned?
8. What is the main source of funding for private schools?
9. Are private schools dependent on local government?
10. What is another term for a private school?

Now, I need to ensure the answers are concise and in Portuguese. Let me check each question and form the answers accordingly. Make sure answers are under 10 words. Also, avoid any markdown and use only the CSV format with semicolons. Let me put them in order and verify the answers align with the context.
