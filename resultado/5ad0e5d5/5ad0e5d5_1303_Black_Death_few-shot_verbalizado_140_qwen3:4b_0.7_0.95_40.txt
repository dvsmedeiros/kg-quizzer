Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to generate 10 CSV lines with questions and answers related to the Black Death based on the provided context. First, I need to make sure I understand the context thoroughly. The Black Death was a pandemic from 1346 to 1353, causing massive deaths, originating in Central or East Asia, spreading via rats and fleas, and having significant social and economic impacts.

I should start by listing possible questions that cover different aspects: origin, spread, causes, effects, etc. The user provided an example with questions about origin, spread, population affected, etc. I need to avoid repetition and ensure each question is unique and based on the facts given.

Looking at the facts, there's mention of the origin in Central or East Asia, spread via Genoese ships, the role of fleas and rats, the different forms of the plague (bubonic, pneumonic), the impact on Europe's population, the time it took to recover, and the discovery of a surge in Kyrgyzstan. Also, the plague's effect on the world population, the different models and categories it's part of.

I need to form questions that are clear and have a single correct answer. For example, "De onde se originou a morte negra?" with the answer "as planícies da Ásia Central," but wait, the context says it's disputed, either Central or East Asia. So maybe the answer should be "Central ou leste da Ásia." But the example given in the user's sample uses "as planícies da Ásia Central," but the actual fact says it's disputed between Central and East Asia. Hmm, need to check that.

Wait, the user's context says: "The origin of the Black Death is disputed. The pandemic originated either in Central Asia or East Asia..." So the correct answer should be either Central or East Asia. But in the example, the answer is "as planícies da Ásia Central," which is a bit specific. Maybe that's acceptable if that's a common answer, but the fact says it's disputed. So maybe the answer is "Central ou leste da Ásia." But the example uses "as planícies da Ásia Central," so maybe I should follow that. However, the user's example might not be entirely accurate, but I need to stick to the given facts. Wait, the user provided a list of facts where one of them is "Black Death possui assunto Category:1350s in Asia" and "Black Death está localizado em Eurasia and North Africa." But the origin is disputed. So the answer should reflect that it's either Central or East Asia. But the example answer is "as planícies da Ásia Central," which is a specific place. However, the fact says it's disputed, so maybe the answer is "Central ou leste da Ásia." But I need to check the user's example. The user's example includes "De onde se originou a morte negra?;as planícies da Ásia Central," which is a specific answer, but according to the fact, the origin is disputed. So perhaps that's acceptable if the answer is commonly accepted as Central Asia. Alternatively, maybe the answer is "Central ou leste da Ásia." But the user's example uses Central Asia. I need to be careful here. Since the user's example uses that, maybe that's acceptable. But the fact says it's disputed. Hmm, maybe the answer should be "Central ou leste da Ásia." But I need to make sure that the answer is based on the given facts. The user's facts mention "The pandemic originated either in Central Asia or East Asia..." so the answer should be either. But the example answer is "as planícies da Ásia Central," so maybe that's acceptable. Alternatively, the answer could be "Central ou leste da Ásia." But the user's example uses "as planícies da Ásia Central," so maybe that's acceptable. I'll proceed with that.

Next, the spread via Genoese ships. The example has "Como a morte negra chegou ao Mediterrâneo e à Europa?;navios mercantes." Which is correct. The context says that from Crimea, it was carried by fleas on Genoese ships.

Another question could be about the population affected. The example has "Quanto da população europeia matou a morte negra?;30 a 60% da população total da Europa." Which is correct based on the context.

Another question could be about the time it took to recover. The example says "Quando a população mundial finalmente se recuperou da morte negra?;século XVII." Which is in line with the context.

Then, the duration of the plague. The example says "Por quanto tempo a praga permaneceu?;até o século." But the context says it was from 1346 to 1353, so the answer should be "de 1346 a 1353." But the example says "até o século," which is vague. But the user's example might not be accurate. Wait, the user's example has "Por quanto tempo a praga permaneceu?;até o século," but the actual duration is 1346-1353, so maybe the answer is "de 1346 a 1353." But the example answer is "até o século," which is incorrect. However, the user's example might not be accurate, but I need to follow the given facts. The user's context says the plague was from 1346 to 1353, so the answer should be "de 1346 a 1353."

Another question is about the different forms of the plague. The context mentions bubonic, pneumonic, and septicemic. But the example doesn't have that. However, the user's facts mention "Black Death é do tipo Outbreak107435273," but that's not directly relevant. Maybe a question about the different forms. For example, "Quais são as formas de disseminação da morte negra?;bubônica, pneumônica e septicêmica." But the user's example doesn't include that.

Another point is the discovery of a surge in Kyrgyzstan. The context says "April 2020" in the facts, but that's a date. Wait, the fact says "Black Death possui data April 2020," which seems incorrect. Wait, the user's facts have "Black Death possui data April 2020" which is likely a mistake, but maybe it's a note. However, the actual origin is in the 14th century, so that's conflicting. Maybe that's a typo. But the user's facts might have some errors, but I need to follow them. However, the user's example has "Quando a população mundial finalmente se recuperou da morte negra?;século XVII," which is correct, as the plague lasted until the 14th century, and recovery took until the 17th century.

So, I need to create 10 questions. Let me list them:

1. De onde se originou a morte negra?
2. Como a morte negra chegou ao Mediterrâneo e à Europa?
3. Quanto da população europeia matou a morte negra?
4. Quando a população mundial finalmente se recuperou da morte negra?
5. Por quanto tempo a praga permaneceu?
6. Quais são as formas de disseminação da morte negra?
7. Qual foi o principal vetor de transmissão da doença?
8. Quais foram os efeitos sociais e econômicos da morte negra?
9. Qual foi a causa principal da morte negra?
10. Quando a morte negra foi confirmada na Ásia?

But need to check if these questions are based on the facts. The user's facts mention the origin in Central or East Asia, spread via Genoese ships, population affected, recovery time, duration, forms of the plague, the primary vector (fleas), effects, cause (Yersinia pestis), and the date of the discovery in Kyrgyzstan (but that's conflicting with the actual date). However, the user's facts have "Black Death possui data April 2020," which seems incorrect, but maybe it's a mistake. However, the user's example has "Quando a população mundial finalmente se recuperou da morte negra?;século XVII," which is correct.

So, the answer to question 5 (duration) should be "de 1346 a 1353." But the example says "até o século," which is incorrect. So need to correct that.

Another question could be about the primary vector, which is the Oriental rat flea.

Another question is the cause, which is Yersinia pestis.

Another question is the effect on the world population, which is 75 million deaths, but the user's example has "Black Death possui número de mortes 75000000" and "motivo 200000000," which seems conflicting. Maybe the number is 75 million, but the user's example might not be accurate. However, the context says "número de mortes 75000000" which is 75 million.

So, the answer to the question about the number of deaths would be "75 milhões de pessoas."

So, compiling all these into 10 questions, ensuring each is unique and based on the facts. Let me structure them now.
