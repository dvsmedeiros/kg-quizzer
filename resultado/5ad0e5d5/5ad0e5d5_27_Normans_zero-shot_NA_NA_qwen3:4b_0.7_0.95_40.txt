Okay, the user wants me to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the provided context about the Normans. Let me start by understanding the context thoroughly.

The context is a detailed historical overview of the Normans, their origins, their influence in various regions, their cultural and military contributions, and their legacy. The key points include their origin in Normandy, the Norman Conquest of England, their role in Sicily, the Crusader states, and their lasting impact on languages and cultures.

Now, I need to create questions that are relevant to this information. Each question should be concise, and the answers need to be short, up to 10 words. Let me brainstorm possible questions.

First, the origin of the Normans: "What was the origin of the Normans?" The answer is "Norse Vikings and Frankish-Gallo-Romans."

Next, their role in England: "What is the Norman Conquest of England known for?" Answer: "Conquering England in 1066."

Their influence on the Crusader states: "Which region did Normans influence in the Near East?" Answer: "Crusader states."

Their cultural impact: "What is a notable cultural contribution of the Normans?" Answer: "Romanesque architecture."

Their language: "What language did Normans adopt?" Answer: "French language."

Military innovations: "What were Normans known for in military?" Answer: "Martial spirit and Catholic piety."

Their legacy in languages: "Which regions have Norman influence in languages?" Answer: "France, England, Spain, Quebec, Sicily."

Their role in the Reconquista: "What did Normans contribute to the Reconquista?" Answer: "Helped in the Reconquista."

Their role in Sicily: "Who founded the Kingdom of Sicily?" Answer: "Roger II."

Their connection to the Channel Islands: "What are the Channel Islands today?" Answer: "Last remnants of the Duchy of Normandy."

I need to check that each answer is under 10 words and that the questions are accurate based on the context. Also, ensure that the CSV format is correct with the separator being a semicolon. Let me verify each pair again to make sure they align with the provided text. Once confirmed, I can format them into the CSV as specified.
