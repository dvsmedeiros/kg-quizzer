Okay, I need to generate a CSV file based on the provided data. Let me start by understanding the data structure. The input is a list of RDF triples, which are statements about entities and their properties. The goal is to convert these into a CSV format with appropriate columns.

First, I'll identify the main entities and their properties. The main entity here is the Scottish Parliament, which has various attributes like location, leader, committees, election dates, etc. There are also other entities like political parties, committees, and individuals related to the parliament.

I need to decide which properties to include in the CSV. The user mentioned including the "name", "type", "location", "leaders", "committees", "election dates", and "other details". Let me map these to the data provided.

The name of the parliament is "Scottish Parliament". The type is "Parliament" and "SocialGroup". The location is "Scotland". The leaders include the Presiding Officer (Alison Johnstone) and the First Minister (Nicola Sturgeon). Committees are listed under ns2:committeeInLegislature and ns1:committees. Election dates are ns2:lastElectionDate and ns1:lastElection. Other details might include the structure, meeting place, and other attributes.

I need to structure the CSV with columns for each of these categories. For example, "Name", "Type", "Location", "Leaders", "Committees", "Election Dates", "Other Details". Each row will represent a different entity or property.

Wait, the data also includes other entities like political parties (e.g., Scottish National Party) and committees. Should these be separate rows or grouped under the main entity? The user's example CSV includes separate rows for each entity, so I'll follow that.

For each entity, I'll list their properties. For instance, the Scottish Parliament has its own set of properties, while the Scottish National Party has its own. I need to extract these and format them into rows.

I should also check for any inconsistencies or missing data. For example, there's a mention of "Alison_Johnstone" as the leader, but in the data, there's also a "George_Adam" listed under ns1:leader. I need to verify which one is the correct leader. Looking at the data, the ns2:leader is "Alison_Johnstone", which is the Presiding Officer, while the First Minister is "Nicola Sturgeon". Wait, in the data, the ns1:leader is "George_Adam", but that might be an error. Let me double-check.

Wait, looking at the data:

- ns2:leader is "Alison_Johnstone" (Presiding Officer)
- ns1:leader is "George_Adam" (but the type is "Presiding Officer of the Scottish Parliament")
- Also, there's a reference to "First Minister of Scotland" under ns1:leader2Type.

Hmm, there might be some confusion here. The user might expect the First Minister as a leader, but the data shows both Presiding Officer and First Minister as leaders. I'll include both, perhaps as separate entries or clarify their roles.

Similarly, the "committees" list includes both ns2:committeeInLegislature and ns1:committees. I need to combine these or list them separately.

I'll proceed by extracting each property, ensuring that all relevant information is included. For each entity, I'll list their attributes in the CSV, making sure to handle different types of data (dates, strings, etc.).

Finally, I'll format the data into a CSV with appropriate headers and values, ensuring that the data is clean and correctly represented.
