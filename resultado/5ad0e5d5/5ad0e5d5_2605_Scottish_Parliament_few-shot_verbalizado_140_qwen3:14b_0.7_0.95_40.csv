Wait, the example provided in the user's message had some answers that were not directly from the abstract but inferred. For instance, "Quantas centenas de anos a Escócia foi governada diretamente pelo parlamento da Grã-Bretanha?;trezentos" which is inferred from the abstract's "from the early 13th century until the Kingdom of Scotland merged with the Kingdom of England under the Acts of Union 1707" – that's about 300 years. So maybe similar inferences are allowed here.
