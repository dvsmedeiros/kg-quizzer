Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs in Portuguese based on the given context about the 1973 oil crisis. Let me start by reading the context carefully.

The context mentions that the crisis began in October 1973 when OAPEC, led by Saudi Arabia, imposed an oil embargo. The targets were countries supporting Israel during the Yom Kippur War, like Canada, Japan, Netherlands, UK, and US. The embargo ended in March 1974, with oil prices rising from $3 to $12 per barrel. It's called the first oil shock, followed by the 1979 crisis as the second.

Now, I need to create varied questions. Let me list possible points:

1. When did the crisis start? Answer: October 1973.
2. Who led the embargo? Saudi Arabia.
3. Which countries were targeted? The initial ones listed.
4. When did the embargo end? March 1974.
5. Price increase? From $3 to $12.
6. Why was the embargo imposed? Support for Israel.
7. What was another name for the crisis? First oil shock.
8. Which countries were later affected? Portugal, Rhodesia, South Africa.
9. What was the effect on oil prices? 300% increase.
10. What was the next crisis called? Second oil shock.

I need to make sure each question is unique and the answers are concise. Check the examples given to match the style. Avoid repetition. Let me verify each answer against the context to ensure accuracy. For example, the first question is straightforward. The second, the leader is Saudi Arabia. The third, the initial nations. The fourth, end date. The fifth, the price range. The sixth, the reason. The seventh, the term "first oil shock". The eighth, the later countries. The ninth, the percentage increase. The tenth, the next crisis as second oil shock.

Now, translate the questions into Portuguese, keeping the answers short. Make sure each line is separated by a semicolon. Check for any possible duplicates or similar questions. Ensure that the answers are exactly as per the context. For instance, "quase US $ 12" in the example, so maybe "quase US$ 12" here. Also, check for proper nouns and correct terms. Alright, I think that's covered.
