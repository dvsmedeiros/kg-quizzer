Okay, I need to create 10 question-answer pairs based on the given context about packet switching. Let me read through the context again.

The context talks about packet switching in telecommunications, how data is grouped into packets with headers and payloads. It mentions Paul Baran's work in the 60s and Donald Davies coining the term packet switching.

I should make sure each question is relevant and the answers are correct and concise, up to 10 words.

Let me think of different aspects: what is packet switching?, its components (header, payload), who developed it?, when did Baran's idea start?, what was his concept called?, how did Davies' work influence later networks, and ARPANET specifically.

I should avoid making the questions too broad or too specific. Each should test a unique point from the context.

Now, I'll structure each question to target these points and craft short, accurate answers.

1;Packet switching groups data into packets for transmission over digital networks.
2;Packets consist of headers (for routing) and payloads (for extraction by systems).
3;Paul Baran developed distributed adaptive message block switching in the 1960s.
4;Donald Davies coined "packet switching" in 1965, inspiring later networks.
5;Header data is used for directing packets to their destinations.
6;Payloads are extracted by operating systems or higher-layer protocols.
7;Early packet switching concepts were fault-tolerant and efficient, as per Baran's research.
8;Baran's ideas contrasted with pre-allocation of network bandwidth in the Bell System.
9;ARPANET adopted packet switching concepts beginning in the 1960s.
10;Davies' work was pivotal in modern networking and data communications.
