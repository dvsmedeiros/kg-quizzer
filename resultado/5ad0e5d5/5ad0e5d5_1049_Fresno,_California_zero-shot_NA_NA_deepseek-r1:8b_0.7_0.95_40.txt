Ok, I need to help create a quiz based on the given context about Fresno. The user wants 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format. Each question should be relevant and the answer should be correct and concise.

First, I'll go through the context to identify key points. Fresno is a major city in California's San Joaquin Valley. It was founded in 1872, incorporated in 1885. It's the county seat of Fresno County and covers about 115 square miles. The population in 2020 was around 542,107, making it the fifth-most populous city in California.

I should create questions that cover different aspects: history, geography, economy, demographics, etc. Let me think of varied questions to ensure a good mix.

1. What year was Fresno founded? That's straightforward from the context.
2. When was Fresno incorporated? Also directly mentioned.
3. Which state is Fresno located in? Since it's in California, that's clear.
4. What is Fresno known for? The ash trees along the San Joaquin River.
5. What is Fresno's population approximate? Around 542k as of 2020.

6. What region does Fresno belong to? The greater Central Valley.
7. Which nearby national parks are mentioned? Yosemite, Kings Canyon, Sequoia.
8. What percentage of Fresno's population was Hispanic in 2020? 50.5%.
9. What is Fresno's role in the economy? An economic hub and agricultural production center.
10. How far is Fresno from Los Angeles? Approximately 220 miles north.

I think these cover a good range. Now, I'll phrase each question clearly and ensure the answers are concise, up to 10 words. Let me double-check for accuracy against the context.
