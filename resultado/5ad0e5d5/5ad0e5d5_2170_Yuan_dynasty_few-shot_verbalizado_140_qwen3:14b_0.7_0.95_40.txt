Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the provided context and facts. Let me start by carefully reviewing the context and the facts to ensure that the questions are relevant and cover different aspects of the Yuan Dynasty.

First, the context mentions that the Yuan Dynasty was established by Kublai Khan in 1271 and lasted until 1368. So, I can create questions about the founder, the establishment year, and the end year. The answer for the founder is Kublai Khan, the establishment year is 1271, and the end year is 1368.

Next, the context states that the Yuan Dynasty followed the Song Dynasty and preceded the Ming Dynasty. That gives me questions about the dynasties that came before and after the Yuan. The answers would be Song and Ming.

The context also notes that Kublai Khan proclaimed the dynasty as the Great Yuan and claimed succession from earlier Chinese dynasties. So, a question about the official name of the dynasty would be "Great Yuan," and another about the succession could mention the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors up to the Tang Dynasty.

Looking at the facts, there's information about the Battle of Lake Poyang being located in the Yuan Dynasty and the use of various Wikipedia templates. However, the instructions say to use the context provided, so maybe those facts are not necessary unless they're in the context. Wait, the user included both the context and the facts, so I should check both. For example, the fact that the Yuan Dynasty is of type WikicatMongolStates might not be directly answerable from the context, but the context does mention it's a Mongol-led dynasty, so maybe a question about the ruling ethnicity.

Also, the context mentions that the Yuan Dynasty was the first non-Han dynasty to rule all of China proper. That's a good point for a question. The answer would be that it was the first non-Han dynasty.

Another point is the capital, which in the context is mentioned as Shangdu. So a question about the capital would have that as the answer.

The context also notes that after the fall of the Yuan, the Genghisid rulers retreated to the Mongolian Plateau and continued ruling until 1635. So, a question about what happened after the Yuan's fall could use that information.

I need to ensure that each question is unique and not repeating the same topic. Let me list out possible questions:

1. Who founded the Yuan Dynasty?
2. When was the Yuan Dynasty established?
3. What was the official name of the Yuan Dynasty?
4. Which dynasty followed the Yuan Dynasty?
5. Which dynasty preceded the Yuan Dynasty?
6. What was the significance of the Yuan Dynasty in Chinese history?
7. What was the capital of the Yuan Dynasty?
8. When did the Yuan Dynasty end?
9. What was the role of Kublai Khan in the Yuan Dynasty?
10. What happened to the Yuan Dynasty after its fall in 1368?

Now, checking the context to make sure each answer is accurate. For example, the official name is "Great Yuan," the capital is Shangdu, the end year is 1368, and after the fall, the rulers retreated to the Mongolian Plateau and ruled until 1635.

I need to make sure that the answers are concise, under 10 words, and directly from the context or inferable. Also, avoid repeating similar questions. Let me refine the list to ensure variety and correctness.
