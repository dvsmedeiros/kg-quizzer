Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs in Portuguese based on the given context about computational complexity theory. Let me start by understanding the context thoroughly.

The context explains that computational complexity theory classifies problems based on resource usage like time and storage. It mentions concepts like P vs NP, algorithms, computability theory, and different measures of complexity such as communication, circuit, and parallel computing. Also, it differentiates between analysis of algorithms and computational complexity theory.

Now, I need to create questions that are relevant to this context. Each question should be followed by a short answer (up to 10 words). Let me brainstorm possible questions:

1. What does computational complexity theory focus on? The answer would be classifying computational problems according to resource usage.
2. What is a computational problem? Answer: A task solved by a computer.
3. What defines a problem as inherently difficult? Answer: Solution requires significant resources.
4. What models are used to study problems? Answer: Mathematical models of computation.
5. What is the P versus NP problem? Answer: A Millennium Prize Problem.
6. What is the difference between analysis of algorithms and complexity theory? Answer: The former analyzes specific algorithms, the latter all possible algorithms.
7. What measures of complexity are mentioned? Answer: Time, storage, communication, circuits, processors.
8. What is the role of computational complexity theory? Answer: Determine limits on what computers can do.
9. What is the key distinction between analysis of algorithms and complexity theory? Answer: Resources needed by a particular algorithm vs. all possible algorithms.
10. What does computability theory focus on? Answer: What problems can be solved algorithmically.

Wait, I need to ensure the answers are concise. Let me check each answer's word count. For example, "classifying computational problems according to their resource usage" is 9 words. That's good. "A task solved by a computer" is 5 words. Okay. "Solution requires significant resources" is 5. "Mathematical models of computation" is 5. "A Millennium Prize Problem" is 4. "The former analyzes specific algorithms, the latter all possible algorithms" is 10 words. Maybe shorten to "Analyzes specific algorithms vs. all possible algorithms" which is 7. 

For the 7th question, the answer should list the measures. The context mentions time, storage, communication, circuit, and parallel computing. So "Time, storage, communication, circuits, processors" – that's 6 words. 

The 9th question's answer: "Resources needed by a particular algorithm vs. all possible algorithms" – 9 words. 

The 10th question's answer: "What problems can be solved algorithmically" – 6 words. 

I need to make sure all answers are under 10 words. Let me adjust any that are longer. 

Now, format each pair as "pergunta;resposta" without markdown. Check for any errors in the context references. For example, the P vs NP problem is a Millennium Prize Problem, so that's correct. 

Double-checking the questions for clarity and relevance. All should be based on the provided context. 

I think that's all. Now, compile the CSV.
