Okay, so I need to help the user by generating a CSV with 10 question and answer pairs based on the provided context about economic inequality. Let me start by understanding the requirements.

First, the user wants each pair in Portuguese, separated by a semicolon. The questions should be varied and cover different aspects of the context. Each answer must be concise, up to 10 words, and directly taken from or inferred from the given information.

Looking at the context, it discusses various types of economic inequality like income and wealth distribution, globalization's impact, policies, and related concepts such as Gini coefficient and HDI. The facts section includes terms like "Economic inequality" linked to different categories and images, but I think the main focus should be on the abstract provided.

I'll need to create questions that touch on these areas without repeating similar ones. For example, one question about income inequality between nations peaking in the 1970s, another about how globalization affects inequality within countries, and perhaps one about the effect of policies on income distribution.

Wait, I should ensure each answer is unique and not too similar to others. Let me jot down some key points from the context:

- Economic inequality includes income and wealth distribution.
- Globalization reduced global inequality but increased it within nations.
- Income inequality between countries peaked in the 1970s.
- Inequality within nations has risen, especially in advanced economies.
- Economic inequality linked to political/social instability.
- Greater inequality hinders economic growth.
- Taxes and transfers reduce income inequality in advanced economies.

Using these points, I can formulate questions around each. For example:

1. What are the main types of economic inequality? (Income and wealth distribution)
2. How has globalization affected inequality between and within nations?
3. When did income inequality between countries peak?
4. Which countries saw increased Gini coefficients?
5. What is linked to political instability due to inequality?
6. How does greater inequality affect economic growth?
7. How much do taxes reduce income inequality in advanced economies?

I need to make sure each question is clear and the answer is directly from the context. Also, varying the structure so they don't all start similarly.

Another point: the user provided an example with answers like "40%", "cerca de 3,5 bilhões", etc., which are specific numbers. I should include similar precise answers where possible.

Wait, in the context, it mentions that income inequality between nations peaked in the 1970s and that most people now live in middle-income countries. That's a good point for a question.

Also, about advanced economies seeing an increase in Gini coefficients exceeding two points—this can be another question.

I need to ensure all answers are within 10 words, so they should be short but precise.

Let me draft some questions and see if they fit:

1. What are the main types of economic inequality measured?
   Answer: Renda e riqueza.

2. How has globalization affected inequality between nations and within them?
   Answer: Reduziu entre nações, aumentou internamente.

3. When did global income inequality peak between countries?
   Answer: Na década de 1970.

4. What percentage of advanced economies saw increased Gini coefficients exceeding two points?
   Answer: Mais de 70%.

5. What is linked to political and social instability due to economic inequality?
   Answer: Revolução, colapso democrático e conflitos civis.

6. How does greater inequality affect economic growth?
   Answer: Inibe o crescimento econômico.

7. How much do taxes reduce income inequality in advanced economies?
   Answer: Em um terço.

8. What is the effect of land and human capital inequality on growth compared to income inequality?
   Answer: Reduzem mais o crescimento.

9. Which index takes inequality into account for human development?
   Answer: Índice de Desenvolvimento Humano Ajustado para Desigualdade.

10. What is the goal of policies affecting income distribution?
    Answer: Reduzir desigualdades socioeconômicas.

I think these cover a range of topics from the context without repeating. Each question is unique and addresses different aspects of economic inequality.
