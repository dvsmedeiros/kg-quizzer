Okay, so I need to create 10 question-answer pairs based on the given context about the French and Indian War. Let me read through the context again carefully to understand the key points.

First, the war took place from 1754–1763 as part of the Seven Years' War. It involved British colonies against French colonies in North America, with both sides supported by Native American tribes. The population numbers are interesting: British had about 2 million settlers while French had around 60,000. So the French relied heavily on their native allies.

The war started because of a dispute over Fort Duquesne at what's now Pittsburgh. George Washington was involved early on in the Battle of Jumonville Glen in 1754. Then in 1755, General Braddock led an attack which failed at the Battle of Monongahela.

There were several key events like the expulsion of Acadians from Nova Scotia between 1755–64, ordered by Governor Shirley without British approval. Also, the capture of Fort Beauséjour in 1755 was significant.

British campaigns in 1755-57 weren't successful due to poor management and effective French and Native resistance. However, from 1758 onwards, with William Pitt increasing resources, the tide turned. The British captured Quebec in 1759 and Montreal in 1760, leading to France ceding most of their North American territories.

After that, per the Treaty of Paris (1763), France gave up territories east of Mississippi to Britain and Louisiana west of it to Spain. The only French presence left was Saint Pierre and Miquelon.

Now, I'll need to extract 10 key points or events from this context. Each question should be clear and directly related to the information provided. Let me think about possible questions:

1. When did the French and Indian War occur?
2. What was the main cause of the war in Ohio?
3. Who led the Virginia militiamen at Jumonville Glen?
4. Why did Braddock's campaign fail?
5. Which fort did the British capture in 1759?
6. When was Fort Beauséjour captured?
7. What were two consequences for Natives during the war?
8. How many French settlers were there compared to British?
9. What was one result of the Treaty of Paris (1763)?
10. Which Acadian event happened between 1755–64?

I should make sure each answer is concise, under 10 words, and in Portuguese as per instructions. Let me structure them accordingly.
