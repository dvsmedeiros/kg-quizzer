Okay, I need to create a quiz based on the given context about European Union law. The user wants 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format. Each question should be relevant and the answers correct and concise.

First, I'll read through the context carefully. It mentions that EU law is a system operating within 27 member states, established since 1952 with the European Coal and Steel Community. Its goals include peace, social justice, a social market economy, full employment, and environmental protection. The Treaties form the constitutional structure, and EU law is interpreted by the Court of Justice.

I should create questions that cover these key points. Let me think about the main aspects: founding, purpose, court system, treaties, member states, and maybe a trick question to test attention.

Starting with the year EU was founded. The context says 1952, so that's straightforward.

Next, what is one of the main goals? It includes promoting peace, so that makes a good question.

What institution handles interpreting law? That would be the Court of Justice, so another question there.

The Treaties are part of the constitutional structure, so that's another point to include.

How many member states as of now? The context says 27, but maybe it's updated. I'll go with 27 unless specified otherwise.

Environmental protection is a goal, so that can be a question about whether it's included.

Then, adding a trick question: is the EU part of the UN? That's incorrect, so it tests knowledge beyond the context.

I need to make sure each answer is under 10 words and in Portuguese. I'll structure each pair with a semicolon separator.

Let me list them out:

1. Year founded.
2. Main goal.
3. Institution interpreting law.
4. Part of constitutional structure.
5. Number of member states.
6. Role of environmental protection.
7. Trick question about UN membership.

I think that covers 10 relevant questions. Now, I'll phrase each question in Portuguese, ensuring the answers are accurate and concise.
