Okay, so I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs based on the given context about economic inequality. Let me first read through the context carefully to understand the key points.

The context talks about different types of economic inequality like income and wealth inequality. It mentions methods for measuring inequality such as the Gini coefficient and the Inequality-adjusted Human Development Index. It also discusses concepts related to equality like equity, equality of outcome, and opportunity. Additionally, it covers how globalization has affected inequality between and within nations, noting that while global inequality has decreased, internal inequality in many countries has increased, especially in advanced economies.

I should focus on extracting the main ideas and important details from this context. Let me list out the key points:

1. Types of economic inequality: income (distribution of money), wealth (assets ownership).
2. Measurement methods: Gini coefficient, Inequality-adjusted Human Development Index.
3. Equality concepts: equity, equality of outcome, equality of opportunity.
4. Globalization impact: reduced global inequality but increased within nations.
5. Trends in income levels: convergence towards middle-income countries post-1970s.
6. Income inequality trends since the 1970s: increase within advanced economies, Gini coefficients rising by over two points in 70% of them.
7. Effects of inequality: linked to political and social instability (e.g., revolution, civil conflict).
8. Impact on economic growth: greater inequality hinders growth; land and human capital inequality have more impact than income inequality.
9. Policy effects: government tax and spending policies significantly affect income distribution.
10. Role of public social spending in advanced economies: reduces inequality by one-third.

Now, I'll create questions based on these points. Each question should be clear and directly relate to the information provided. The answers should be concise, typically a short phrase or term.

Let me draft each pair:

1. What are the two main types of economic inequality discussed? - Income and wealth.
2. Which index combines inequality with human development? - Inequality-adjusted HD Index.
3. How does globalization affect global versus national inequality? - Reduces global, increases internal.
4. Where do most people live now in terms of income? - Middle-income countries.
5. How have Gini coefficients changed in advanced economies? - Increased by over two points in 70%.
6. What is a common effect of high economic inequality? - Political and social instability.
7. Which form of inequality has the biggest impact on growth? - Land and human capital inequality.
8. What policy tool affects income distribution significantly? - Tax and spending policies.
9. How much does public spending reduce inequality in advanced economies? - By one-third.

Wait, I only have 9 so far. Let me check the key points again to find another. Oh, point 3 mentions concepts of equality: equity, outcome, opportunity. That can be a question about these concepts.

10. What are the main concepts related to equality? - Equity, equality of outcome/opportunity.

I think that covers all the main points. Now I'll format each pair as per the required CSV structure.
