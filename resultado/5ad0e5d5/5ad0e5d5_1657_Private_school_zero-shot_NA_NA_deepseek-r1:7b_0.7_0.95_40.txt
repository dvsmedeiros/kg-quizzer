Okay, so the user wants me to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the given context about private schools. Let me break this down.

First, I need to understand the context thoroughly. The context mentions that a private school isn't funded by the government, unlike public schools. It also talks about governance structures like boards of governors and systems ensuring independent operation.

Now, the task is to create 10 pairs where each pair has a question in Portuguese followed by the short answer in English, all within CSV format. Each line should be "pergunta;resposta".

I'll start by identifying key points from the context that can translate into questions. For example, understanding what a private school isn't about—so I can ask if it's funded by the government or not.

Next, terms like "board of governors" are important. So a question about who runs the school could be good. Also, aspects like funding sources beyond government support should come up in some questions.

I'll make sure each question is clear and directly related to the context without being too obscure. The answers need to be concise and accurate based on the information provided.

Let me list out possible topics: definition of private schools, funding sources, governance structures, ownership types, and operational aspects like financial independence or reliance on boards.

Now, I'll draft each question ensuring they cover these areas without repetition. Each should have a clear answer that's straightforward to verify from the context.

Once all 10 pairs are ready, I'll format them into CSV, separating each pair with a semicolon as specified.
