Ok, I need to create 10 question;answer pairs in CSV format based on the given context about Normans. The questions should be relevant and have correct short answers. Let me start by understanding the key points from the context.

The Normans originated in the Duchy of Normandy from Viking settlers mixing with Franks. They became a distinct identity in the 10th century. They had significant military impacts, like the Norman Conquest of England in 1066 and expansion to Sicily and other areas. Their cultural influence includes architecture, language, and religion.

Now, I'll brainstorm questions that cover different aspects: origins, language, religion, key events, cultural impact, and regional dialects.

1. Where did the Normans settle initially? They settled in Normandy, so the question could be about their place of origin.
2. What language did they speak? It was Old Norman, a form of Latin influenced by Viking settlers.
3. When did they gain a distinct identity? The first half of the 10th century.
4. Who were the key figures, like Rollo, who became count of Normandy after the siege of Chartres in 911.
5. What was their military impact? They played roles in the Reconquista and Crusades, among others.
6. What regions still have Norman dialects today? The Channel Islands (Jèrriais and Guernésiais) and parts of France.
7. Which historical event involved Norman victories, like the Battle of Hastings in 1066 leading to the Norman Conquest of England.
8. What religious changes happened? They adopted Christianity and became prominent in Catholic orthodoxy.
9. How did they influence other areas culturally? Through architecture like Romanesque style and military innovations.
10. Which territories still exist as remnants of the Duchy of Normandy? The Channel Islands (Bailiwicks of Guernsey and Jersey).

Now, I'll make sure each question is distinct and answers are concise based on the context provided.

Let me check for any repetition or overlapping topics. Each question targets a different aspect to ensure variety.

Finally, I'll format them into CSV with semicolons as separators.
