2. For each URI; list the values of each property.
Each of these properties may have multiple values; so I need to join them with a delimiter like semicolon or comma.
Now; looking at the data:
- The first entry is `<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Islamism>`; which has multiple properties. The other entries are like `<http://dbpedia.org/resource/...>` with properties pointing to "Islamism".
Alternatively; the user might want a CSV that lists all the properties of the "Islamism" entry. The example response shows the "Islamism" URI with its properties.
For the "Islamism" URI; the values would be:
- Date: April 2022; June 2022
