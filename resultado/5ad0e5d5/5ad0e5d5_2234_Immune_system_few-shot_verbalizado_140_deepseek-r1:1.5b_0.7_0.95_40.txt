Okay, I need to create a quiz based on the immune system content provided. The user has given 10 pairs of questions and answers in CSV format. Let me break this down.

First, I'll go through each point one by one. For each point, I need two lines in the CSV: the question and the answer. I must ensure that each line is a single question or a complete sentence as per the rules.

I should also make sure that each question is relevant to the context given and doesn't repeat similar ones. It's important to use the correct Portuguese and keep each response concise, up to 10 words.

Let me start with the first point: The immune system is a network of biological processes protecting an organism from diseases. How does the immune system detect pathogens? I'll need a clear question that tests understanding here.

Next, the immune system detects various pathogens like viruses and bacteria. Which systems are involved in this detection? This should be another relevant question about components of the immune response.

Immune cells have specific structures, right? What is a well-known structure within the immune system? Maybe asking about cell types or their roles would work here.

The immune system uses molecules to respond, not just the body's own healthy tissues. Which molecule is central to this process? Phagocytosis and antimicrobial peptides are examples given in the context, so that makes sense as a question.

Dendritic cells are involved in recognizing antigens by accumulating on their surfaces. How do they function? This should be a clear question about cell structure or functions within the immune system.

I remember that both innate and adaptive immunity use preconfigured responses to broad stimuli. How does this apply to specific pathogens like viruses with distinct structures? The question should test understanding of categorization.

Adapted immunity leads to an immunological memory, enhancing future responses to similar pathogens. This is a key concept in the context. So, I'll phrase it as a question about how adaptive immunity works post-antigenic encounters.

Lastly, autoimmune diseases occur when immune cells attack normal tissues. How are these reactions measured? This should test knowledge on diagnostics and methods used in immunology.

Now, I need to ensure each answer is correct and relevant. No repetition of questions or answers. Also, the language must be consistent with Portuguese and concise.

I'll go through each point again to make sure I'm covering all aspects without missing anything important from the provided context.

The immune system is a network of biological processes that protects an organism from diseases. How does it detect pathogens?  
Phagocytosis and antimicrobial peptides are examples of molecules used in immune response.

Immune cells have specific structures, right? What structure within the immune system is recognized by accumulation on their surfaces? Phagocytosis and antimicrobial peptides called defensins are key examples.

The immune system uses molecules to respond. Which molecule is central to detecting pathogens through phagocytosis? Antimicrobial peptides called defensins are involved in this process.

Dendritic cells recognize antigens by accumulating on their surfaces. How do they contribute to immune response? Dendritic cells play a role in recognizing and processing antigens during the adaptive immune response.

Adapted immunity creates an immunological memory, enhancing future responses to similar pathogens. This is based on categorization of pathogen structures.

Adapted immunity leads to an immunological memory. How does this memory enhance the body's ability to respond? The concept is rooted in categorizing and learning specific pathogen structures.

Automated systems are used to identify abnormal cells, which are typically immune cells. How do these systems function within the immune response? Adaptive (or acquired) immunity creates an immunological memory, aiding future responses.

Autoimmunity occurs when immune cells attack normal tissues. How is this reaction measured in medical diagnostics? Autoimmune diseases are characterized by hyperactive immune responses against normal tissues.

Immunodeficiency results from reduced activity compared to normal. How does this condition affect patient outcomes? Immunodeficiency can lead to recurrent infections and may result in severe complications.
