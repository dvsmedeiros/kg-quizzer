Okay, let's tackle this. The user provided a list of RDF triples related to Warsaw and wants a CSV generated based on those. The instructions mention using the specified format, so I need to make sure I follow that.

First, I need to parse all the triples. Each triple has a subject, predicate, and object. The main thing is to extract the subject (which is always "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Warsaw" or similar), the predicate (like ns2:aprSnowDepthCm), and the object. 

Looking at the examples, some predicates have values like "1", "38", etc., while others have more complex values, like URLs. The user mentioned that the CSV should have columns for subject, predicate, and object. Also, the postal code is "0", and there are some URLs in the depiction. 

Wait, the example given in the user's message has some lines where the object is a URL, like <http://commons.wikimedia.org/...>. But in the CSV, should those be included as objects? The user's instruction says "gere agora o CSV conforme Instruções e Regras." But the original instruction (which is in Portuguese) might have specific rules. However, since the user provided a sample response, I should check that.

Looking at the sample response, the CSV includes the subject, predicate, and object. The objects are the values from the triples. For example, "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Warsaw" is the subject, "ns2:aprSnowDepthCm" is the predicate, and "1" is the object. Also, the depiction URLs are included as objects in the CSV. 

So, the key is to extract each triple and format them into the CSV with the three columns. The user might want all the triples, including the depiction URLs. However, in the sample provided, the depiction URLs are part of the object field. 

I need to make sure that all the triples are included. Let me go through each line and extract the subject, predicate, and object. The subject is always "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Warsaw", but sometimes other entities are subjects, but looking at the data, the main subject is Warsaw. Wait, looking at the data, most of the subjects are "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Warsaw", but some are other entities like "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Polish_Medical_Association", etc. However, the user's final instruction says to generate the CSV, so I need to include all the triples as they are.

Wait, but looking at the user's example response, the first line is:

"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Warsaw", "ns2:aprSnowDepthCm", "1"

Then there's a line with the depiction URLs. So in the CSV, the objects can be strings, numbers, or URLs. So the task is to take each triple and put them into the CSV with the three columns.

I need to make sure that all the triples are included. Let me count how many there are. The original data has a lot of lines, each with a subject, predicate, and object. So the CSV should have each of these as rows. The sample shows that the depiction URLs are included as objects in the CSV. So, for example, the line with the depiction URLs would be:

"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Warsaw", "ns2:foaf:depiction", "<http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Warszawa,_Rynek_Nowego_Miasta_2_20170516_001.jpg>, <http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Wilanów_Palace.jpg>"

But in the sample response, the user's example has that line as a separate row. So each triple is a row in the CSV.

Therefore, the correct approach is to take each line of the RDF triples, split them into subject, predicate, and object, and then write them into the CSV with the three columns. The user might have intended that, so I need to follow that.
