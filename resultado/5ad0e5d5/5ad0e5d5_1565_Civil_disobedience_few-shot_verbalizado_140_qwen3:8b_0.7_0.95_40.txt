Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the provided context and facts. Let me start by understanding the context. The main topic is civil disobedience, which is the active refusal to obey certain laws, especially nonviolent. The examples given include historical figures like Henry David Thoreau, Susan B. Anthony, Gandhi, and Martin Luther King Jr. Also, there are mentions of various protests and movements using civil disobedience, like the Iranian protests, the Syrian Revolution, and the End SARS protests.

First, I should make sure each question is unique and covers different aspects. Let me look at the facts provided. There are a lot of instances where different movements and events used civil disobedience. For example, the Iranian general strikes, the Syrian Revolution Network, the Kenosha unrest, and the Women in the Yellow Vests movement. Also, there are specific people like Tony Milligan and the Ruckus Society associated with it.

Now, I need to form questions that are relevant and have clear answers. Let me think of possible questions. For instance, who popularized the term civil disobedience? The answer would be Henry David Thoreau. Another could be, what is the main characteristic of civil disobedience? The answer would be nonviolent resistance. 

Wait, the example given in the user's message includes questions about specific events, like the Iranian protests in 2018-2019. So maybe I should include some questions about specific movements or events. For example, which country's protests in 2020 used civil disobedience? The answer would be Kazakhstan. 

I need to ensure that the answers are directly inferable from the context or facts. Let me check the facts again. The facts mention the Iranian protests against compulsory hijab, the Kenosha unrest, the End SARS protests, etc. Also, the Civil Rights Movement in the US used civil disobedience. 

Another angle is the people associated with it. For example, who was a leader inspired by civil disobedience? Answer: Mahatma Gandhi. Or, which movement is known for its use of civil disobedience? The answer could be the Civil Rights Movement in the US.

I should avoid repetition. Let me list possible questions:

1. Who popularized the term civil disobedience? Answer: Henry David Thoreau.
2. What is the main characteristic of civil disobedience? Answer: Nonviolent resistance.
3. Which movement in the US used civil disobedience? Answer: Civil Rights Movement.
4. Which country's protests in 2020 used civil disobedience? Answer: Kazakhstan.
5. What is the purpose of civil disobedience according to Martin Luther King Jr.? Answer: A display of reverence for law.
6. Which event in 2019 used civil disobedience? Answer: Iranian general strikes.
7. Who was inspired by civil disobedience in the 1910s? Answer: Saad Zaghloul.
8. Which movement in Nigeria used civil disobedience? Answer: End SARS protests.
9. Which country's 2021 protests used civil disobedience? Answer: Montenegro.
10. What is an example of civil disobedience in India? Answer: Indian independence movement.

Wait, I need to check if these answers are present in the context or facts. The context mentions the Civil Rights Movement and Martin Luther King Jr. The facts mention the Iranian protests, End SARS, Kenosha unrest, etc. Also, the Indian independence movement is referenced with Gandhi. 

I need to make sure the answers are concise and within 10 words. Let me verify each answer. For example, "Civil Rights Movement" is the answer to the fourth question. "Kazakhstan" is correct for the 2020 protests. "End SARS" is the answer for Nigeria's movement. 

I should also ensure that the questions are varied, not just about events or people but also about definitions and key points. Let me check if I have 10 unique questions. Yes, the list above has 10. Now, format them into CSV with semicolons. Make sure the answers are in the correct language (Portuguese) and that the CSV has exactly 10 lines. Also, check for any duplicates or similar questions. For example, the first question is about Thoreau, and the third is about the US movement. They are different. 

I think that's all. Now, I'll write the CSV accordingly.
