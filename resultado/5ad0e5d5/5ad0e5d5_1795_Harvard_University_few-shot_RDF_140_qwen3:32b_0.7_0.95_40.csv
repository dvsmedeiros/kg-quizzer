I need to parse each line, extract the subject (the person's name), the predicate, and then map the predicate to a category. For example, if the predicate is "almaMater", the category is "University"; if it's "workplaces", the category is "Employer". But how do I determine the category from the predicate? The user didn't specify, so I need to infer based on common knowledge. For example, "almaMater" typically refers to the university someone attended, so the category is "University". "workplaces" would be "Employer", "education" might be "Academic Institution", etc.
