Okay, so I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs based on the given context about BSB and its merger with Sky Television. Let me start by reading through the context carefully.

BSB was a television company headquartered in London that provided satellite TV services starting from March 1990. They merged with Sky Television on November 2, 1990, to form British Sky Broadcasting.

First, I should think about key points: when BSB started broadcasting, their headquarters location, the merger date and company name change.

For each question, I need a relevant one and a short correct answer. Let me brainstorm some questions:

1. When did BSB start its satellite TV services?
   - March 1990

2. Where was BSB's headquarters located?
   - London

3. What date did BSB merge with Sky Television to form British Sky Broadcasting?
   - November 2, 1990

4. What company did BSB merge with?
   - Sky Television

5. What entity was formed after the merger?
   - British Sky Broadcasting

6. In which country was BSB operating before the merger?
   - United Kingdom

7. What year did BSB start broadcasting?
   - 1990

8. Was BSB a direct broadcast service provider?
   - Yes

9. What is the correct name after the merger?
   - British Sky Broadcasting

10. Where was BSB's headquarter?
    - London

Wait, some of these might overlap or be too similar. I should check for uniqueness and make sure each question is distinct.

1. When did BSB start broadcasting? Answer: March 1990
2. Where was BSB based? Answer: London
3. What date was the merger? Answer: November 2, 1990
4. Who did they merge with? Sky Television
5. What's the new company name? British Sky Broadcasting
6. In which country did BSB operate? UK
7. What year did broadcasting begin? 1990
8. Did they provide direct broadcasts? Yes
9. After merger, what entity was formed? BSB and Sky formed BSkyB?
Wait, maybe I should adjust some to ensure accuracy.

Maybe question 5 could be about the new name, which is British Sky Broadcasting. Question 9 could be about the merged company's name, perhaps including "Sky" in it.

I need to make sure each answer is precise and within 10 words as per instructions. Let me structure them accordingly.
