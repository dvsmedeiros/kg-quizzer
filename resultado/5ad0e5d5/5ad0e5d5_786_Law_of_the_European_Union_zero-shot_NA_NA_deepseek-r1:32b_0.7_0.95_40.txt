Alright, so I need to generate a quiz based on the provided context about European Union Law. Let me start by reading and understanding the context thoroughly.

The context mentions that EU law is a system within 27 member states, established since 1952 with the European Coal and Steel Community. The main objectives are promoting peace, social justice, a social market economy with full employment, and environmental protection. It also notes that the Treaties form the constitutional structure, and the Court of Justice handles interpretations and creates case law.

Now, I need to create 10 relevant questions and answers in Portuguese, following the specified CSV format. Each question should be clear and directly related to the context provided. The answers must be concise, within 10 words each.

Let me outline possible questions:

1. When was the EU established? (Year)
2. How many member states are there now?
3. What's the main goal of EU law regarding peace?
4. Which economic model does EU law support?
5. What about full employment in EU objectives?
6. Name one key aspect besides the economy.
7. When did the European Coal and Steel Community start?
8. How many countries were initial members? (Wait, context says 27 now but original might have been fewer; maybe I should check that.)
9. Which institution interprets EU law?
10. What's the role of the Court of Justice?

Wait, the context doesn't specify the exact number of founding member states beyond mentioning it started with the European Coal and Steel Community in 1952. So perhaps a safer question is about when that community was founded rather than how many initial members there were.

Also, I need to make sure all questions are unique and cover different aspects of the context without overlapping too much.

Let me draft each pair:

1. When was the European Union established? Answer: 1952 (Wait, no—the EU itself was formed later; the Coal and Steel Community was in 1952. The EU as we know it came from the Maastricht Treaty in 1993. Hmm, this is a bit tricky. Maybe I should clarify that.)

Actually, reading the context again: "European Union law... since the 1952 founding of the European Coal and Steel Community." So perhaps the EU as an entity started later, but its legal framework began with ECSC in '52.

Therefore, question about when the legal system started would be 1952.

Similarly, the number of member states is currently 27.

So:

1. Em que ano foi criada a CECA?;1952
Wait, but the context says EU law grew since 1952 founding of ECSC. So perhaps the question should be about when the legal system started.

Alternatively, maybe better to ask about the Coal and Steel Community's founding year.

But considering the quiz is about EU Law, perhaps focusing on that:

Pergunta: Em que ano foi fundada a Comunidade Europeia do Carvão e do Aço?;Resposta: 1952

Similarly, another question: Quantos Estados-Membros tem a União Europeia atualmente?;27

Another point is the objectives: paz, justiça social, economia de mercado social com pleno emprego, proteção ambiental.

So questions about these aspects:

- Qual é um dos objetivos principais do direito da UE mencionados no texto?;Promover a paz
Or asking for each objective separately, but since I need 10 questions, perhaps focus on key points.

Also, the Treaties form the constitutional structure: "The Treaties of the European Union agreed to by member states form its constitutional structure." So question about what forms the EU's constitutional structure? Answer: Tratados

And the judicial branch is the Court of Justice: "interpreted by... the Court of Justice." So questions about who interprets EU law.

Putting it all together, I'll create 10 questions ensuring they are clear and cover different aspects without overlap. Also, making sure answers are accurate based on the context.
