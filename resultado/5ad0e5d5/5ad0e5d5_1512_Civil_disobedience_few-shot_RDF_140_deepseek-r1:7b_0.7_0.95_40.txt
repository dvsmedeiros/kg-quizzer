Alright, I need to generate 10 questions and answers related to the context provided about civil disobedience. Let me start by understanding the key points from the given abstract.

Civil disobedience is defined as rejecting a government's laws without violence. It's often equated with peaceful protests but must be nonviolent. The example is Henry David Thoreau's "Resistance to Civil Government." Key historical examples include Susan B. Anthony, Saad Zaghloul, Mahatma Gandhi, Martin Luther King Jr., and the 2017 protests in Iran.

Looking at the Fatos section, there are several DBpedia entries that provide more instances of civil disobedience across different countries and movements. These include examples from Russia, Montenegro, Albania, Serbia, St. Louis, Iran, among others.

Now, I need to create varied questions based on this context. Each question should be clear, relate directly to the context, and have a concise answer that can be derived from the provided data.

I'll start by identifying different aspects of civil disobedience: its definition, historical examples, modern movements, specific instances in various countries, and associated events or consequences.

1. **Definition and Purpose**: "What is civil disobedience?" with an answer referencing Thoreau's example.
2. **Historical Figure**: Who was a key early proponent? Answering with Susan B. Anthony.
3. **Specific Movement**: The Montenegrin crisis in 2015-2016 as an example of civil disobedience.
4. **Methodology**: What is the method used in protests like the Iranian general strikes?
5. **Religious Figure**: Gandhi's involvement in civil disobedience against British rule.
6. **Modern Movement**: The St. Louis protests in 2018-2019 as a recent instance.
7. **Event Name**: The end of the SARS epidemic via civil disobedience or protests.
8. **Clerical Protests**: The 2019 Montenegrin clerical protests as an example.
9. **Peaceful Protests**: King's view on peaceful but nonviolent protests.
10. **Movement Overview**: The purpose of the civil rights movement in the US.

I need to ensure each question is unique and covers different areas within the context, avoiding repetition. Also, the answers should be accurate based on the provided data without adding new information.

Let me structure each question and answer pair, ensuring they're concise and fit into the CSV format with semicolons separating them.
