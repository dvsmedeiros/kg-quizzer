Okay, so I need to create 10 question and answer pairs in Portuguese based on the given context about private schools. The questions should be varied and cover different aspects of what's provided.

First, looking at the abstract, it mentions that private schools are not administered or funded by the government and have financial endowments independent of national or local governments. They usually have a board of governors ensuring their independent operation.

The facts list many specific schools as examples of private schools across various countries and regions. This suggests that the questions can include both general aspects (like definitions) and specific examples from the list.

Let me brainstorm possible question types:

1. Definition-based: What is another name for a school not administered by the government?
2. Characteristics: How are private schools typically funded compared to public ones?
3. Governance structure: Who manages private schools to ensure their independence?
4. Geographic usage: In which region are universities referred to as 'private schools'?
5. Specific examples: Name one of the private schools listed.

I need to make sure each question is unique and covers different facets without repeating similar topics. Also, each answer should be concise and directly extractable or inferable from the context provided.

Now, I'll draft 10 questions:

1. What term is used alongside 'private school' to describe non-governmental educational institutions?
2. How are private schools primarily funded instead of relying on public funds?
3. What body usually manages a private school's operations and ensures its independence?
4. Besides Canada and the UK, which country doesn't typically refer to universities as private schools?
5. In which part of the world is 'private school' used to denote universities?
6. Name one of the private schools listed in the facts.
7. What distinguishes a private school from a public one regarding funding sources?
8. How does governance in private schools differ from that in public institutions?
9. What is another term for an independent educational institution not funded by the state?
10. Which specific type of educational institution is often associated with being private?

Now, I'll match each question with its correct answer based on the context and facts:

1. The other name mentioned is "escola independente."
2. Private schools are typically financed through their own financial endowments.
3. They usually have a board of governors managing operations.
4. Australia doesn't refer to universities as private schools.
5. In North America, 'private school' refers to universities.
6. Any school from the facts list, like "Davao Christian High School."
7. Private schools rely on their financial endowments rather than government funds.
8. Governance involves a system ensuring independent operation.
9. Another term is "escola particular."
10._prep__Private institutions are often associated with specific governance structures.

I need to ensure each answer is short and precise, fitting within 10 words as per the instructions.

Double-checking for any repetitions or overlaps in topics. Each question addresses a different aspect: definitions, funding, governance, geography, examples.

Looks good. Now, I'll format them into CSV pairs with Portuguese questions and answers.
