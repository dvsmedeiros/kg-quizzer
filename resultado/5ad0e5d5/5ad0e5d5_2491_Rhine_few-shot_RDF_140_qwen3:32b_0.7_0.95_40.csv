The user's goal is to create a CSV with questions and answers derived from this data. The example given is in Portuguese; so I need to ensure the CSV follows that language. Each row should have a question in Portuguese and the corresponding answer based on the data provided.
Finally; I'll structure each row in the CSV with a question in Portuguese and the answer. I'll make sure the answers are accurate based on the provided data and avoid any assumptions beyond what's given.
