Okay, let's see. The user wants me to generate a CSV file based on the given instructions and rules. The data provided is in Turtle format, which is an RDF serialization. My task is to parse this data and convert it into a CSV format with specific columns.

First, I need to understand the structure of the data. The main resource here is "Construction", and there are various other resources linked to it through different predicates. The user mentioned using the "csv" and "turtle" libraries in Python, so I'll need to use those.

I'll start by parsing the Turtle file. Using the `rdflib` library, I can read the Turtle data and extract the triples. The main subject is "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Construction". The relevant predicates are probably the ones that link other resources to this main subject, like `ns1:wikiPageUsesTemplate`, `skos:closeMatch`, `foaf:depiction`, etc.

Looking at the example provided in the user's previous answer, the CSV has columns like "Subject", "Predicate", "Object", and "Object Type". So, I need to extract each triple (subject, predicate, object) and determine the type of the object. The object type can be a literal (like a string or number) or a URI (another resource).

For the Turtle data, the main subject is "Construction", and the objects can be literals (like "30", "201.2", etc.) or other resources (like `http://dbpedia.org/resource/Template:DEU`). I need to iterate through each triple where the subject is "Construction" and extract the predicate and object, then categorize the object type.

Wait, the example in the user's previous answer includes the object type. For example, the "barWidth" predicate has a literal object "30" with object type "Literal". The "data" predicate has a list of numbers, which are literals separated by commas. The "wikiPageUsesTemplate" predicate has URIs as objects, so their object type is "URI". The "closeMatch" and "depiction" are also URIs.

So, the plan is:

1. Parse the Turtle data into triples.
2. Filter all triples where the subject is "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Construction".
3. For each filtered triple, extract the predicate, object, and determine the object type (literal or URI).
4. Format these into CSV rows with columns: Subject, Predicate, Object, Object Type.

I need to handle the "data" predicate carefully because it's a list of literals separated by commas. The example shows each value as a separate row. Wait, in the example, the "data" predicate has multiple values. So in the CSV, each value in the list would be a separate row with the same subject and predicate, but different objects. For example, "201.2", "36.3", etc., each as a separate row under the "data" predicate.

But in the given Turtle data, the "data" predicate has four values. So, I need to split them into individual rows. Similarly, the "wikiPageUsesTemplate" has two URIs, so each would be a separate row.

So, the steps would be:

- For each triple, if the object is a list (like for "data"), split it into individual elements and create a row for each.
- If the object is a single literal or URI, create one row.

I also need to make sure the CSV has the correct headers: "Subject", "Predicate", "Object", "Object Type".

Now, considering the code. Using Python's `rdflib`, I can parse the Turtle data. Then, iterate over each triple where the subject is "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Construction". For each triple, check the type of the object. If it's a URI, then object type is "URI". If it's a literal, then the object type is "Literal".

But the "data" predicate in the example has multiple literals separated by commas. In the Turtle data, the "ns1:data" has four values. So, when parsing, I need to split them into separate rows. However, in RDF, a predicate can have multiple values, each as a separate triple. So in the Turtle data, "ns1:data" has four values, which would be four separate triples. Wait, in the given Turtle, it's written as:

ns1:data "201.2",
        "36.3",
        "839.1",
        "92.6" ;

So, in Turtle syntax, this is one triple with a list of literals. But in RDF, each value is a separate triple. Wait, no. Wait, in Turtle, when you have a predicate with multiple values separated by commas, it's considered as multiple objects for the same predicate. So in RDF, this would be four separate triples with the same subject and predicate but different objects. So, in the parsed graph, each of these would be a separate triple.

Wait, but in the Turtle syntax, when you have multiple objects for a predicate, like:

<subject> <predicate> "object1", "object2" .

This is equivalent to:

<subject> <predicate> "object1" .
<subject> <predicate> "object2" .

So, in the parsed graph, the "data" predicate would have four triples, each with one of the values. Therefore, when I parse the Turtle data, the graph will have four entries for the "data" predicate, each with a different object.

Similarly, the "wikiPageUsesTemplate" predicate has two URIs as objects, so that's two triples.

So, in code, when I query the graph for all triples where the subject is "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Construction", I will get all these individual triples, including the four "data" entries and the two "wikiPageUsesTemplate" entries.

Therefore, in the code, I can iterate over all these triples, and for each, determine the object type. For the "data" entries, they are literals, and the "wikiPageUsesTemplate" entries are URIs.

Thus, the code can be structured as follows:

1. Parse the Turtle data into a Graph.
2. Query all triples where the subject is "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Construction".
3. For each triple, extract the predicate and object.
4. Determine the object type (URI or Literal).
5. Write these into the CSV with the appropriate columns.

Now, handling the namespaces. The predicates are in the "ns1" namespace, which is bound to "http://dbpedia.org/ontology/". But in the example, the predicate is written as "barWidth", "data", etc., without the namespace. So, in the CSV, the predicate column should just be the local name, like "barWidth", "data", etc., not the full URI.

Wait, looking at the example in the user's previous answer, the predicate is "barWidth", "data", "wikiPageUsesTemplate", etc. So, the full URI is "http://dbpedia.org/ontology/barWidth", etc., but in the CSV, it's just the local part. So, I need to extract the local name of the predicate.

In `rdflib`, the predicate is a URIRef. To get the local name, I can split the URI at the last slash or the hash. For example, "http://dbpedia.org/ontology/barWidth" would have the local name "barWidth".

So, for each predicate URI, extract the local name.

Now, putting this into code.

First, import necessary modules:

import rdflib
from rdflib import URIRef, Namespace
import csv

Then, define the namespaces. The "ns1" in the Turtle is bound to "http://dbpedia.org/ontology/". Also, "skos" is bound to "http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#", and "foaf" is "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/".

But in the Turtle data, the predicates are from "ns1", "skos", and "foaf". So, I can define the namespaces accordingly.

But when parsing, the Turtle file may have the prefixes defined. However, since I'm reading the data directly, I can handle the URIs as they are.

Now, read the Turtle data:

g = rdflib.Graph()
result = g.parse(data, format='turtle')

Assuming that 'data' is the Turtle string provided.

Then, query all triples where the subject is "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Construction".

subject = URIRef("http://dbpedia.org/resource/Construction")

for s, p, o in g.triples((subject, None, None)):
    # process each triple
    predicate_uri = p
    predicate_name = predicate_uri.split('#')[-1].split('/')[-1]
    object_value = o
    object_type = 'URI' if isinstance(o, URIRef) else 'Literal'
    # write to CSV
    ...

But wait, for the "data" predicate, each value is a Literal, so the object_type would be "Literal".

Now, for the CSV, the subject is always "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Construction", the predicate is the local name, the object is the value (either the string of the literal or the URI as a string), and the object_type is "URI" or "Literal".

So, the code would generate rows like:

Subject,Predicate,Object,Object Type
"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Construction",barWidth,"30",Literal
"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Construction",data,"201.2",Literal
"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Construction",data,"36.3",Literal
...

But in the example provided by the user, the "data" entries are in separate rows with the same predicate. So, that's correct.

Now, testing with the given Turtle data:

The "barWidth" predicate has one object "30" (literal).

The "data" predicate has four objects: "201.2", "36.3", "839.1", "92.6" (each as a literal).

The "wikiPageUsesTemplate" has two URIs as objects.

The "closeMatch" is a URI.

The "depiction" is a URI.

So, in the CSV, there should be 1 (barWidth) + 4 (data) + 2 (wikiPageUsesTemplate) + 1 (closeMatch) + 1 (depiction) = 9 rows.

Wait, the example in the user's previous answer has 9 rows, which matches this count.

So, the code should generate 9 rows.

Now, implement this in Python.

But the user wants the code in a code block, and the CSV output as a text block.

So, the code would be something like:

import rdflib
from rdflib import URIRef, Namespace
import csv

data = """..."""  # the Turtle data provided

g = rdflib.Graph()
g.parse(data=data, format='turtle')

subject = URIRef("http://dbpedia.org/resource/Construction")

rows = []

for s, p, o in g.triples((subject, None, None)):
    predicate_uri = p
    # Extract predicate name (local part)
    predicate_name = predicate_uri.split('#')[-1].split('/')[-1]
    object_str = str(o)
    if isinstance(o, URIRef):
        object_type = "URI"
    else:
        object_type = "Literal"
    rows.append({
        "Subject": str(subject),
        "Predicate": predicate_name,
        "Object": object_str,
        "Object Type": object_type
    })

# Write to CSV
with open('output.csv', 'w', newline='', encoding='utf-8') as csvfile:
    fieldnames = ["Subject", "Predicate", "Object", "Object Type"]
    writer = csv.DictWriter(csvfile, fieldnames=fieldnames)
    writer.writeheader()
    writer.writerows(rows)

But the user might not have the data variable, so in the code, the data is provided as the Turtle string.

Now, testing this code with the given Turtle data.

The Turtle data includes:

ns1:barWidth "30" ;
ns1:data "201.2",
        "36.3",
        "839.1",
        "92.6" ;
ns1:wikiPageUsesTemplate <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Template:DEU> , <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Template:Infobox> ;
skos:closeMatch <http://example.org/closematch> ;
foaf:depiction <http://example.org/depiction> .

Assuming the Turtle data is as given.

Parsing this with the code should generate the correct rows.

Now, for the "data" predicate, each value is a separate triple, so four rows with predicate "data" and each object.

The "wikiPageUsesTemplate" has two URIs, so two rows.

The "closeMatch" and "depiction" are each one row.

So, the code should generate the correct CSV.

Now, the user's example output has the "Object" column with quotes around the values. For example, "30" is written as "30". In CSV, if the value contains commas, it's enclosed in quotes, but in this case, the literals don't have commas, so they can be written without quotes. However, in the example, the user has quotes around the literals. So, perhaps the code should enclose all literals in quotes. But in the example, the user's output doesn't show quotes, but in the actual CSV, quotes are used when necessary. However, the user's example shows "30" as "30", but in the actual CSV, the quotes might be part of the data. Wait, no—CSV fields that contain commas or special characters should be quoted. Since the example shows "30" without quotes, maybe the user expects the object to be the string as is, without surrounding quotes. But in the Turtle, the object is a string literal, so when parsed, it's a rdflib.Literal object. When converted to a string, it's just the value, e.g., "30".

In the code, when we do `object_str = str(o)`, it will be "30" without quotes. So, in the CSV, the object column will have "30", "201.2", etc., without quotes. However, if the value contains commas, it would need to be quoted. But in the example, the user's output doesn't show quotes, so that's acceptable.

Thus, the code as written should produce the correct CSV.

Now, putting it all together. The code would parse the Turtle data, extract the relevant triples, and write them to a CSV file with the specified columns.

**Explicação:**
- O código parseia os dados Turtle e extrai todos os triples relacionados ao sujeito `Construction`.
- Cada predicado é mapeado para seu nome local (sem URI completa).
- Os objetos são classificados como `Literal` (valores textuais/numéricos) ou `URI` (referências a recursos).
- O resultado é salvo em um arquivo CSV com colunas `Subject`, `Predicate`, `Object` e `Object Type`.
