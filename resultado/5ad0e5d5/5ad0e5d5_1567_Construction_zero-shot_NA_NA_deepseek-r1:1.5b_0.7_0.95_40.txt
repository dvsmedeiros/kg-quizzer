Okay, so I need to create a Python script that generates 10 pairs of question and answer based on the provided context about construction. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I should understand the structure required. The output needs to be in CSV format with two columns: "pergunta;" followed by ";resposta" separated by a semicolon and a point. Each row has a question and its correct answer. So, 10 rows mean 10 questions and 10 answers.

Next, I'll look at the context provided. The main points are:
- Construction is defined.
- Key terms in construction include building, structure, etc.
- There's a section on global expenditure on construction activities, mentioning $4 trillion in 2012 and rising to $11 trillion by 2030.

I should extract relevant keywords that can be turned into questions. Let me list some important terms:
1. Construction
2. Building
3. Structure
4. Bridge
5. Wall
6. Foundation
7. Home
8. Infrastructure
9. Expansion
10. Demolish

Each of these can become a question, and their definitions or common usage as answers.

I need to ensure that each answer is concise, up to 10 words. I should also make sure the questions are clear enough for someone without prior knowledge to understand them correctly.

Let me start drafting some questions:
- construction: The art and science of forming objects.
- building: The act of constructing or assembling something.
- structure: The arrangement of parts in a system.

Wait, these might be too basic. Maybe I should include more specific terms related to global expenditure data, but the context doesn't provide that information. So maybe it's better to stick to the main definitions provided.

I can also think about synonyms for some terms. For example, instead of just "bridge," perhaps "structure in buildings" or "bridge over water." But I need to make sure each answer is directly relevant and within word limits.

Let me go through each term and create a question:

1. Construction
   - What is construction?
2. Building
   - How do you build something?
3. Structure
   - Define structure.
4. Bridge
   - What is a bridge made of? (But this might be too specific; maybe just the general definition.)
5. Wall
   - What consists of walls made of?
6. Foundation
   - The foundation of what?
7. Home
   - How do you build a home?
8. Infrastructure
   - General term for transportation.
9. Expansion
   - Building on existing structures.
10. Demolish
    - Process of breaking down.

Hmm, some of these might need adjustments to be more accurate or concise while keeping within the word limit. Also, I should ensure that each answer is directly related to the context provided without adding extra information beyond what's given.

Let me try again with some adjustments:

1. Construction
   - What is construction? How do you build things?
2. Building
   - How do you construct something?
3. Structure
   - Define structure.
4. Bridge
   - What consists of bridges made of? (This might need a more specific answer.)
5. Wall
   - What are walls built from?
6. Foundation
   - What is the foundation of what?
7. Home
   - How do you construct a home?
8. Infrastructure
   - General term for transportation.
9. Expansion
   - Building on existing structures.
10. Demolish
    - Process of disassembling something.

Wait, "walls" and "foundation" might need more specific answers since they're part of the construction context. Let me refine those:

4. Bridge
   - What consists of bridges made of? (Perhaps "concrete, steel beams," or "girders" or "piles.")
5. Wall
   - What are walls built from?
6. Foundation
   - What is the foundation of what?

I think that's better because it stays within word limits and relates to construction terms.

Now, I'll make sure all answers are clear and directly tied to the context provided without unnecessary details or synonyms that might confuse someone who isn't familiar with all the terms.

Let me summarize each question:

1. What is construction? How do you build things?
2. How do you construct something?
3. Define structure.
4. What consists of bridges made of? (Refined as what are walls built from?)
5. What are walls built from?
6. What is the foundation of what?
7. How do you construct a home?
8. General term for transportation in construction.
9. Building on existing structures.
10. Process of disassembling something.

I think this covers all the key terms and stays within the constraints of 10 questions and their respective answers. I should then format them into a CSV as specified.
