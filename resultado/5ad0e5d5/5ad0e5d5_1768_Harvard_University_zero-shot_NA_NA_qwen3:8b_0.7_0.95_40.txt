Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the provided context about Harvard University. Let me start by reading through the context carefully to identify key facts and important details.

First, the context mentions that Harvard was founded in 1636 as Harvard College. That's a key historical fact. So a question could be about the founding year. The answer would be 1636.

Next, it states Harvard is the oldest institution of higher learning in the US. So another question could ask about that distinction. The answer would be "oldest institution of higher learning in the US."

The text also says Harvard has three main campuses. A question about the number of campuses would have "three" as the answer.

Harvard's endowment is valued at $50.9 billion, making it the wealthiest academic institution. So a question on the endowment value would have that exact figure as the answer.

Another point is the endowment per student being the fifth-largest in the US. That's a specific detail, so a question about that ranking would have "fifth-largest in the US" as the answer.

The Harvard Library is the world's largest academic library system with about 20.4 million items. A question on the library's size would have "world's largest academic library system" as the answer.

The context mentions that Harvard's founding was authorized by the Massachusetts colonial legislature. A question about the reason for founding could have "dreading to leave an illiterate ministry to the churches" as the answer.

It also states that Harvard co-founded the Association of American Universities in 1900. A question on that event would have "1900" as the answer.

James B. Conant led during the Great Depression and WWII, and liberalized admissions post-war. A question about his leadership period would have "Great Depression and World War II" as the answer.

Lastly, the text notes Harvard alumni include eight U.S. presidents and 188 living billionaires. A question about the number of U.S. presidents would have "eight U.S. presidents" as the answer.

Now I need to format these into CSV with semicolons, ensuring each answer is concise and within 10 words. Let me check each pair for accuracy and brevity.
