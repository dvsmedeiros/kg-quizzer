Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs in Portuguese based on the provided context and facts about the Law of the European Union. Let me start by understanding what's given.

The abstract explains that EU law is a supranational system within its 27 member states, established since 1952 with goals like peace, social justice, etc. It mentions treaties as the constitutional structure and the Court of Justice for interpreting and creating case law.

Looking at the facts, there are several key points:
- John Bell is a legal scholar in the area.
- Common Market Law Review is associated with this discipline.
- The main topic is clearly the EU Law itself.
- Henry G. Schermers is another subdiscipline within this field.
- Various wiki templates are used for structuring pages.

Now, I'll brainstorm different aspects to cover:
1. Number of member states (27).
2. Founding year of the European Coal and Steel Community (1952).
3. The main judicial branch's name.
4. Objectives like social justice, etc.
5. Constitutive treaties as the foundation.
6. Name of the journal related to EU Law.
7. Legal scholars in this field.
8. Subdisciplines within EU Law.
9. Templates used for wiki pages.

I'll make sure each question is unique and covers a different aspect without repetition. Also, each answer should be concise, up to 10 words, and in Portuguese.

Let me start drafting the questions:

1. How many member states are in the EU? (27)
2. What year was the European Coal and Steel Community founded? (1952)
3. Which court interprets EU law? (Court of Justice...)
4. What is one goal of EU Law? (Peace, social justice...)
5. What forms the EU's constitutional structure? (Treaties...)
6. Name a journal related to EU Law. (Common Market...)
7. Who is a scholar in this area? (John Bell or Henry Schermers)
8. Another journal name?
9. A subdiscipline within EU Law. (Henry G. Schermers)
10. Wiki template used for redirecting.

I need to phrase them as questions with short answers, ensuring variety and coverage of all points without overlapping.
