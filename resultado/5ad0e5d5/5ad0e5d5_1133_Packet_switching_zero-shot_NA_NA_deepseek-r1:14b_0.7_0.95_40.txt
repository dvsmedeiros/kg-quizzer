Okay, so I need to generate 10 question-response pairs based on the given context about packet switching in telecommunications. The output should be a CSV with each line containing a question and its correct answer separated by a semicolon. Each question should be relevant to the context provided.

First, let me read through the context carefully to understand the key points. 

The context explains that packet switching is a method used in telecommunications where data is grouped into packets for transmission over digital networks. Each packet has a header and payload. The header directs the packet to its destination, and the payload is used by the OS or applications. Packet switching is the basis for global computer networks.

It also mentions Paul Baran's work in the early 1960s at RAND Corporation, funded by the U.S. Department of Defense. He developed "distributed adaptive message block switching," which aimed to create a fault-tolerant and efficient routing method. His ideas were ahead of their time and contradicted existing principles like pre-allocation of bandwidth from the Bell System.

Despite his contributions, Baran's work didn't gain much attention until British scientist Donald Davies at NPL in 1965. Davies coined the term "packet switching" and influenced many subsequent networks, including ARPANET in the U.S.

So, key terms to focus on: packet switching, header, payload, Paul Baran, distributed adaptive message block switching, fault-tolerant routing, Donald Davies, ARPANET.

Now, I need to create 10 questions. Let's start brainstorming possible questions:

1. What is the primary method for data communication in computer networks worldwide?
2. Who developed "distributed adaptive message block switching"?
3. When did Paul Baran develop his concept?
4. What was the goal of Baran's research at RAND Corporation?
5. Which term was later used to describe packet switching by Davies?
6. What is the main purpose of the header in a packet?
7. Who is credited with coining the term "packet switching"?
8. Which network incorporated packet switching after Davies' work?
9. What did traditional telecommunications use before packet switching?
10. How did Baran's ideas contrast with existing telecom principles?

Let me ensure each question has a clear, short answer based on the context.

Double-checking to make sure all answers are correct and concise.
