Okay, so I need to generate a CSV with 10 question-answer pairs based on the given context about the immune system. Let me start by understanding what the user is asking for.

The user provided an abstract explaining the immune system, some RDF triples, and examples of previous questions. My task is to create new questions that cover different aspects of the immune system without repeating similar ones. Each question should have a short, correct answer derived from the context or the triples.

First, I'll read through the abstract again to identify key points. It mentions that the immune system protects against diseases by detecting pathogens and distinguishing them from healthy tissue. There are two main subsystems: innate and adaptive immunity. Adaptive immunity includes immunological memory, which is the basis of vaccination. Dysfunctions in the immune system can lead to issues like autoimmune diseases or immunodeficiency.

Looking at the triples, they list various cells and components related to the immune system, such as B cells, T cells, macrophages, etc. There are also mentions of medical causes linked to the immune system, like food allergies and sepsis.

I should create questions that touch on these areas. For example, one question could be about what the immune system protects against. Another could ask about the main subsystems or specific cells involved.

I need to make sure each question is unique and covers different aspects. Maybe I can also include questions about the consequences of immune system dysfunction, like autoimmune diseases or immunodeficiency.

Let me think of 10 topics:
1. What does the immune system protect against?
2. Main subsystems.
3. Cells involved in adaptive immunity.
4. Immunological memory's purpose.
5. Basis for vaccination.
6. Consequence of overactive immune system (autoimmune diseases).
7. Examples of autoimmune diseases.
8. Immunodeficiency causes.
9. Components that detect pathogens.
10. How the immune system distinguishes between healthy and harmful cells.

I'll structure each question to have a clear, concise answer based on the abstract or triples. I need to ensure that the answers are accurate and directly related to the provided information.

Now, putting it all together into CSV format with semicolon separators.
