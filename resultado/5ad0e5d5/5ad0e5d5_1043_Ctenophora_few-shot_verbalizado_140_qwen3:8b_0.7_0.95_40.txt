Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the provided context about Ctenophora. Let me start by understanding the context and the facts given.

First, the context talks about Ctenophora being a phylum of marine invertebrates, commonly known as comb jellies. They use cilia called "combs" for swimming, and they range in size from a few millimeters to 1.5 meters. There's mention of their body structure, diet, and their position in the evolutionary tree. Also, there are some taxonomic disputes regarding their placement relative to sponges and other animals.

The facts include various details like their common names, images, wiki templates, categories, and specific species like Callianira hexagona and Coeloplana. There's also information about their fossil records dating back to the Cambrian period and their classification under different taxonomic groups.

Now, I need to create 10 unique questions. Let me brainstorm possible questions:

1. What is the common name for Ctenophora? (Answer: Comb jellies)
2. What do they use for swimming? (Answer: Cilia called "combs")
3. What is their size range? (Answer: Up to 1.5 m)
4. What is their primary diet? (Answer: Predators of small organisms)
5. When do fossils of Ctenophora date back to? (Answer: Early Cambrian, 525 million years ago)
6. What is their classification? (Answer: Phylum)
7. What are their body structures like? (Answer: Jelly-like with two-cell layers)
8. What is the debate about in molecular phylogenetics? (Answer: Their position in the tree of life)
9. What are some examples of species? (Answer: Cydippids, Beroids)
10. What is their significance in the tree of life? (Answer: Second-earliest branching lineage)

Wait, I need to ensure the answers are accurate and derived from the context. Let me check each point against the provided text.

For the first question, the context says they are commonly known as comb jellies. That's correct. For the second, the cilia are called "combs." Third, the size range is mentioned. Fourth, they are predators. Fifth, the fossils are from the early Cambrian. Sixth, they are a phylum. Seventh, their body has a jelly mass with two-cell layers. Eighth, the debate is about their position in the tree of life. Ninth, examples include cydippids and beroids. Tenth, the debate is about their lineage.

I should make sure the answers are concise and within 10 words. Also, avoid repeating questions. Let me structure them in CSV format with semicolons. Check for any duplicates and ensure each answer is directly from the context.
