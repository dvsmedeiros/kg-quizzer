Okay, so I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs in Portuguese based on the provided content about computational complexity theory. Let me go through this step by step.

First, I'll read the abstract carefully to understand the key points. It mentions that computational complexity theory is a part of theoretical computer science and mathematics. It focuses on classifying problems according to resource usage like time and storage. It also talks about models of computation, communication complexity, circuit complexity, and parallel computing. The P vs NP problem is highlighted as one of the Millennium Prize Problems.

Looking at the triples, they list several researchers known for their work in this field. This might be useful for a question about notable contributors or specific concepts they're associated with.

Now, I need to make sure each question is varied and covers different aspects of the topic. I'll start by identifying main themes: definition of computational complexity, its classification based on resources, related fields like analysis of algorithms and computability theory, methods used (like mathematical models), specific problems or measures (e.g., P vs NP, circuit complexity), and practical implications.

I should structure each question to target a unique aspect. For example:
1. What is the main focus of computational complexity theory?
2. Which resources are primarily measured in this field?
3. How do problems get classified based on their difficulty?

I also need to ensure that answers are concise, within 10 words, and directly tied to the provided content. I'll avoid repeating similar questions and make sure each one is distinct.

Let me draft some potential questions:
- What distinguishes computational complexity from computability theory?
- Who are some notable researchers in this field? (But wait, the triples list several names, but including a list might be too long for an answer. Maybe better to ask about their contributions instead.)

I should also consider examples given in the context, like the P vs NP problem and circuit complexity.

Another angle is the practical role of computational complexity theory, such as determining what computers can or cannot do efficiently.

I'll make sure each question has a clear, single correct answer that's supported by the provided information. For instance:
- "What are the two main resources used to measure complexity?" Answer: tempo e armazenamento.
- "Which problem is dedicated to computational complexity and offers a prize?" Answer: P versus NP.

I need to structure these in Portuguese, ensuring proper grammar and clarity.

Let me outline the 10 questions I can create:
1. What is the main focus of computational complexity theory?
2. Which resources are primarily measured in this field?
3. How do problems get classified based on their difficulty?
4. What distinguishes computational complexity from computability theory?
5. What method is used to study resource requirements for solving problems?
6. Who is known for contributing significantly to this field? (But maybe better to focus on concepts rather than people)
7. What are other measures of complexity besides time and storage?
8. What is the role of computational complexity theory in practical computing?
9. How does the P vs NP problem relate to this field?
10. What distinguishes analysis of algorithms from computational complexity theory?

I think these cover a broad range of topics within computational complexity without overlapping too much. Now, I'll translate them into Portuguese and ensure each answer is correct and concise.

Making sure not to repeat similar questions and that each addresses a unique aspect.
