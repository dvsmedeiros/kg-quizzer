Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the provided context about the Black Death. Let me start by understanding the context thoroughly. The Black Death was a deadly plague pandemic from 1346 to 1353, causing massive deaths, especially in Europe. It's linked to Yersinia pestis, spread by fleas and rats, but also person-to-person via aerosols. The origin is debated, with possible starting points in Central or East Asia, spreading through Crimea and Genoese ships. There's a mention of a surge in Kyrgyzstan in the late 1330s, suggesting the origin might not be from Mongol conquests. The plague had significant social, religious, and economic impacts.

Now, I need to create 10 relevant questions. Each question should be concise, and the answer must be a short phrase (up to 10 words). The questions should cover different aspects of the Black Death: origin, cause, spread, effects, etc. Let me brainstorm possible questions.

1. What is the main cause of the Black Death? (Answer: Yersinia pestis)
2. When did the Black Death occur? (Answer: 1346–1353)
3. What were the primary modes of plague spread? (Answer: Fleas, rats, person-to-person)
4. Which regions were most affected? (Answer: Europe, Middle East, North Africa)
5. What was the estimated death toll in Europe? (Answer: 30–60%)
6. How did the plague spread from Crimea? (Answer: Rats on Genoese ships)
7. What was the origin of the Black Death? (Answer: Central or East Asia)
8. What was the impact on Europe's population? (Answer: Reduced by 30–60%)
9. When did the plague first appear in Kyrgyzstan? (Answer: Late 1330s)
10. What was the main form of the plague in Europe? (Answer: Pneumonic plague)

I need to check if these questions are accurate based on the context. The answer for question 6 is correct as it mentions rats on ships. Question 7's origin is indeed disputed, so that's okay. The answer for question 9 is based on the 2022 discovery. The answers are all within 10 words. Let me format them as CSV pairs, ensuring the separator is semicolon. Also, make sure the answers are concise. That should cover 10 questions. Let me verify each one again to ensure they match the context.
