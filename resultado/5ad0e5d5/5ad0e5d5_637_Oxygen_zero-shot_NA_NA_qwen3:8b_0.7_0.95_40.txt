Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the provided context about oxygen. Let me start by understanding the context thoroughly.

The context talks about oxygen's chemical properties, its abundance in Earth and the universe, its role in the atmosphere, biological importance, photosynthesis, ozone, and its discovery history. 

First, I'll identify key points that can form questions. For example, the symbol and atomic number, the group in the periodic table, its role in the atmosphere, the formula for dioxygen, its presence in organic molecules, the process of photosynthesis, ozone's role, and the discoverers.

I need to make sure each question is concise and the answers are short, under 10 words. Let me list possible questions:

1. What is the chemical symbol for oxygen?
2. What group in the periodic table is oxygen a member of?
3. What is the formula for dioxygen gas?
4. What percentage of Earth's atmosphere is dioxygen?
5. What is the major constituent of living organisms by mass?
6. What process replenishes oxygen in the atmosphere?
7. What is the role of ozone in the atmosphere?
8. Who coined the name "oxygen"?
9. What is the primary function of oxygen in combustion?
10. What is a common use of oxygen in industry?

Now, check if these questions are relevant and the answers are accurate based on the context. Ensure answers are brief. For example, the answer to question 4 is "20.95%", which fits. The answer to question 7 should mention UVB absorption. 

I need to avoid any markdown and ensure the CSV format uses semicolons. Let me structure each line as "pergunta;resposta". Also, verify that each answer is correctly derived from the context. Once all 10 pairs are confirmed, I'll compile them into the CSV format as specified.
