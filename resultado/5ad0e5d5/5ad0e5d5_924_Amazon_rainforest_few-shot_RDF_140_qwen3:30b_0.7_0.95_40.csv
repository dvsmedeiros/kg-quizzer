Looking at the data; here are some key points:
- The Amazon rainforest has a total width of 700 units (probably kilometers; but the data doesn't specify).
- It's a forest; which is its hypernym.
Now; I need to form questions that can be answered with this data. Let me list possible questions:
Wait; but some answers might be longer than 10 words. Let me check:
- Another question: "What is the total area of the Amazon rainforest?" – But the data doesn't mention area; only totalWidth. So maybe not.
For the question about the main subject; maybe "What is the main subject of the Amazon rainforest page?" – Answer: Amazon biome (2 words).
Alternatively; "What is the hypernym of the Amazon rainforest?" – Answer: Forest (1 word).
I think that's manageable. Now; compiling the 10 entries:
