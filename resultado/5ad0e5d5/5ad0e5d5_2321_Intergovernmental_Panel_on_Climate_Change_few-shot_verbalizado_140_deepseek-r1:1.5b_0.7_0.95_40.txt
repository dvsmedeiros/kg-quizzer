Okay, I need to help the user generate a CSV with 10 pairs of question and answer based on the provided context about the IPCC. Let me start by understanding what's required.

First, I'll review the abstract, triplables, and examples given to ensure all necessary information is covered. The main points are:

- The IPCC was established in 1988.
- It has multiple working groups and a task force focused on climate change.
- The IPCC's role includes preparing reports for governments.
- It assesses global warming impacts and proposes mitigation actions.

Next, I'll list the key facts from the context to create clear questions. Each question should be concise and have one or two sentences of information. For example:

1. Who established the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)?
2. What role does IPCC play in climate change research?

I need to ensure each answer is accurate and directly related. Also, I must avoid repeating questions without rephrasing them.

Now, structuring this into a CSV. The first row will be headers: "Question" and "Response." Each subsequent line will have two entries, one from the question and one from the response.

I'll make sure each question is unique and covers different aspects of the IPCC's role to ensure variety. Also, I'll avoid using markdown and keep it simple with proper formatting.

Finally, I'll review the CSV to ensure it follows all user instructions: exactly 10 lines, correct headers, and accurate data.
