Okay, so I need to create a CSV file with 10 question-response pairs about the Yuan Dynasty in Portuguese. Let's start by understanding what the user is asking for.

First, the user provided an abstract and several triplets of facts about the Yuan dynasty. They also included some example questions and answers in Chinese, which might help me get a sense of the structure they want. The output needs to be in CSV format with each line being "pergunta;resposta". 

I should make sure that each question is unique and covers different aspects of the Yuan dynasty. Let's look at the context and facts given.

From the abstract, I know that the Yuan dynasty was established by Kublai Khan, it followed the Song dynasty and preceded the Ming, it was the first non-Han dynasty to rule all of China, and it lasted from 1271 to 1368. The capital was Shangdu, and they used paper currency among other things.

Looking at the facts, there's a lot about Kublai Khan, Genghis Khan, battles, emperors, and various events. I should extract key points from these.

Now, thinking of possible questions: who started it, when was it established, what was its official name, where was the capital, who succeeded Kublai, which dynasty came before and after, key figures like Genghis Khan's role, important battles or dates, the successor state, and perhaps something about governance.

I should ensure each question is clear and has a single correct answer from the provided context. I'll also need to vary the questions to cover different areas—dates, names, people, places, etc.

Let me list out potential questions:

1. Who founded the Yuan dynasty?
2. What was the official name in Chinese?
3. When was it established?
4. Which dynasty came before?
5. Which came after?
6. Where was its capital?
7. What was Kublai Khan's grandfather's name?
8. What successor state emerged after 1368?
9. What was used as currency?
10. Which battle marked the end of their rule?

Wait, I should check each of these against the facts to ensure accuracy.

For example, question 7: Kublai Khan's grandfather was Genghis Khan—correct. Question 3: Established in 1271—yes. The dynasty after Yuan is Ming, before it is Song—all correct.

I also need to make sure that each response is concise and fits within the context provided. I should avoid repeating similar questions. For instance, if one question is about Kublai Khan's title, another shouldn't be too similar.

Let me structure each line as "pergunta;resposta", using Portuguese for the questions and answers. The responses should be short, up to 10 words.

So, compiling all that, I can create a CSV with these pairs:

1. Quem fundou a dinastia Yuan?;Kublai Khan
2. Qual era o nome oficial em chinês?;Grande Yuan
3. Em que ano foi estabelecida?;1271
4. Qual foi a dinastia predecessora?;Song
5. Qual foi a dinastia sucessora?;Ming
6. Onde estava localizada a capital?;Shangdu
7. Quem era o avô de Kublai Khan?;Genghis Khan
8. Qual foi o estado sucessionário após 1368?;Estado do Norte dos Yuan
9. Qual moeda foi usada?;Notas de papel
10.Qual batalha marcou o fim da dinastia?;Batalha de Yamen

Wait, the last one: According to the abstract, the Southern Song was defeated in 1279 at the Battle of Yamen, which completed the conquest. So that's the battle that ended their rule over the South.

I should double-check each point against the context and facts provided to ensure accuracy.
