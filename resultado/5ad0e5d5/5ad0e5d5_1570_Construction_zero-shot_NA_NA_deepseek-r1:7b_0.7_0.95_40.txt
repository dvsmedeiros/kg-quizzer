Okay, so I need to help the user generate a quiz based on the provided context about the construction industry. The user has already given me an example of how they want it formatted with 10 question-answer pairs in CSV. My task is to create another set following that structure.

First, I'll read through the context carefully to understand the key points. It talks about the definition of construction, its various aspects like planning, financing, design, and maintenance, global spending trends, economic impact, and some statistics regarding accidents or fatalities in the industry.

Now, I need to come up with 10 different questions that cover these topics. Each question should be clear and direct, avoiding any ambiguity. The answers must be concise, just a few words each, as per the user's instructions.

I'll start by identifying relevant sections of the context:

1. **Definition**: What is construction? – This can be answered with "The art and science to form objects."
2. **Origin**: Construction comes from Latin... – So, its origin would be "From com-" and "struere."
3. **Noun vs. Verb**: The noun is construction; the verb is construct. That's straightforward.
4. **Scope of Construction**: It involves delivering buildings, infrastructure, etc. A good question here could ask about the types it covers beyond that, but maybe I can phrase it as what construction includes.
5. **Role in GDP**: The context mentions spending on construction contributing to GDP. Maybe a percentage or exact figure? Wait, the user wants short answers, so perhaps "Significant contribution" is better than specifics unless they are short.
6. **Global Spending**: The context says about $4 trillion in 2012 and it's over $11 trillion now. A question could be how much was spent in 2012 or the current figure.

Wait, I think focusing on key facts without needing exact numbers is better for short answers. Let me adjust:

- **Global Spending**: The context says global expenditure exceeded $11 trillion a year.
7. **Economic Impact**: Construction promotes economic development and brings non-monetary benefits. A question could ask if construction promotes economic development, with the answer being "Yes."
8. **Hazardous Industry**: It mentions that about 20% of US fatalities happened in construction. So a question like "What percent..." makes sense.
9. **Risk Example**: The context states 1,061 deaths in 2019. A question could be "How many deaths occurred."
10. **Compare with GDP**: It's about 13% of global GDP. A question asking what percentage it is.

Wait, I think some questions may not fit perfectly because the context doesn't mention the exact figure for 2012 or 2030 projections. Maybe better to focus on clear yes/no, percentages, and direct facts.

Let me structure each question step by step:

1. What does construction primarily involve?
   - Answer: Forming objects.
   
2. Construction comes from which parts of Latin?
   - Answer: "Com-" and "struere."

3. The noun form is called...; the verb is...
   - Answer: Construction (noun); construct (verb).

4. What does construction cover beyond buildings?
   - Answer: Infrastructure, industrial facilities, etc.

5. What's a significant part of global GDP related to construction?
   - Answer: Approximately 13%.

6. How much did global spending on construction reach in 2019?
   - But the context doesn't specify that for 2019; it says about $4 trillion in 2012 and over $11 trillion now.

7. Construction is known for being... industry.
   - Answer: One of the most hazardous.

8. What's a statistic mentioned about US fatalities?
   - Answer: About 20% in 2019.

9. How many deaths occurred in construction-related accidents in 2019?
   - Answer: 1,061.

10. What is the approximate percentage of global GDP construction represents?
    - Answer: Around 13%.

Wait, but I need to make sure the questions are distinct and cover different points without overlapping too much.

Alternatively:

I can structure it as follows:

1. Primary focus of construction.
2. Origin parts from Latin.
3. Noun vs verb.
4. Scope beyond buildings.
5. Contribution to GDP.
6. Global spending trend (increase).
7. Percentage related to hazardous industries.
8. Statistic on fatalities in the US.
9. Number of fatalities in 2019.
10. Percentage of global GDP.

Yes, that makes sense. Each question covers a unique point from the context and can be answered concisely.

I'll now format these into the required CSV structure with each pair on separate lines.
