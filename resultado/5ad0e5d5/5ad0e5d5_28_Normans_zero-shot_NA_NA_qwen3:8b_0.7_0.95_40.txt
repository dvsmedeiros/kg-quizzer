Okay, the user wants me to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the provided context about the Normans. Let me start by reading through the context carefully to understand the key points.

First, the Normans originated from the Duchy of Normandy, a mix of Norse Vikings and West Franks. The term "Norman" comes from the Latin "Nortmanni." Then there's Rollo's agreement with King Charles III in 911, which legitimized their settlements. The cultural and linguistic blend led to the Norman identity, adopting French language and customs. The Duchy of Normandy's political structure under Richard I, and its later status as a fief of France. The Norman Conquest of England in 1066, the role in Sicily, the Iberian Reconquista, and their legacy in languages and legal systems.

I need to make sure each question is concise and the answers are short, under 10 words. Let me list possible questions: origin of Normans, their identity formation, Rollo's role, language adoption, Duchy's status, Norman Conquest, Sicily's Kingdom, Iberian Reconquista, legacy, and current remnants. Wait, that's 10. Let me check each for accuracy. For example, the answer to the origin should mention Norse Vikings and West Franks. The answer to Rollo's agreement is swearing fealty to Charles III. The language part would be Gallo-Romance. The Duchy's status as a fief of France. The Norman Conquest's impact on England. Sicily's Kingdom under Roger II. Iberian Reconquista's role. Legacy in languages. Current remnants as Channel Islands. That covers all key points. Now, format them into CSV with semicolons, ensuring no markdown. Double-check the answers for brevity and correctness.
