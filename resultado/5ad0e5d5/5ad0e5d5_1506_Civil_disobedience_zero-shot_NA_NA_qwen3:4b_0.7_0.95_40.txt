Okay, the user wants me to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the provided context about civil disobedience. Let me start by understanding the context thoroughly. The key points are that civil disobedience involves refusing to obey certain laws, especially nonviolently, and examples include Thoreau, Gandhi, MLK, etc. The definition emphasizes nonviolence and the idea that it's a way to highlight unjust laws.

First, I need to make sure each question is relevant and based on the given text. The answers should be concise, under 10 words. Let me brainstorm possible questions. Maybe start with the definition, then examples of historical figures, the nonviolent aspect, the purpose, and the legal implications. 

For example, a question could be "What is civil disobedience?" and the answer would be "Active refusal to obey unjust laws nonviolently." Then another question about Thoreau's essay. I need to check if the examples given in the context are accurate. The user mentioned Susan B. Anthony, Saad Zaghloul, Gandhi, MLK, and Bevel. 

I should ensure that each answer is a direct fact from the text. Also, avoid any questions that require more than a brief answer. Let me list out possible questions and answers:

1. Definition of civil disobedience.
2. Thoreau's essay title.
3. Nonviolent aspect of civil disobedience.
4. Examples of leaders inspired by it.
5. Purpose of civil disobedience.
6. Legal implications.
7. MLK's view on civil disobedience.
8. Historical events linked to it.
9. Key characteristic of civil disobedience.
10. Who popularized the term in the US.

Wait, the user provided examples, so I should check if the answers are accurate. For instance, Thoreau's essay is "Resistance to Civil Government." The answer should be that. Also, the answer about the legal implications says it's rarely justifiable in court, which is correct. 

Now, making sure each answer is under 10 words. Let me check each one:

1. "Active refusal to obey unjust laws nonviolently." – 9 words.
2. "Resistance to Civil Government." – 4 words.
3. "Nonviolent to be called 'civil'." – 5 words.
4. "Susan B. Anthony, Saad Zaghloul, Mahatma Gandhi." – 7 words.
5. "Highlight unjust laws and provoke conscience." – 7 words.
6. "Rarely justifiable in court." – 5 words.
7. "Display and practice of reverence for law." – 7 words.
8. "Egyptian Revolution of 1919, Indian independence." – 8 words.
9. "Active refusal to obey laws, nonviolent." – 8 words.
10. "Henry David Thoreau." – 4 words.

That seems to fit. Now, format them into CSV with the correct separators. Make sure no markdown, just plain text. Each line is a question followed by answer, separated by semicolon. Check for any typos or errors. Once done, that should meet the user's requirements.
