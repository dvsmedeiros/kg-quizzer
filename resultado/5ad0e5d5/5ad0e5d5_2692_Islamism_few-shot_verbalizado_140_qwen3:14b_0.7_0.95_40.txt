Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the provided context and facts. Let me start by understanding the context thoroughly. The context explains Islamism as a political ideology aiming to reconstitute modern states according to Islamic principles. It mentions different strategies like revolutionary or reformist approaches, the emphasis on Sharia, and the rejection of Western influences. Also, there are references to various groups and figures associated with Islamism.

Looking at the facts, there are numerous organizations and individuals linked to Islamism, along with some technical details like Wikipedia templates and images. However, the main focus should be on the core concepts from the abstract, as the questions need to be based on that.

First, I'll list key points from the abstract: definition of Islamism, strategies (revolutionary vs. reformist), goals (implementation of Sharia, Islamic states, removal of non-Muslim influences), figures (Hassan al-Banna, Sayyid Qutb), and impact on the Middle East.

Next, I need to form questions that cover these points. Each question should have a unique aspect. For example, one could ask about the definition, another about strategies, another about the rejection of Western influence, and so on. I should ensure that answers are concise and directly derived from the text.

I need to avoid repeating similar questions. Let's check the example provided to see the structure. The example includes questions about the objectives, strategies, origins, and characteristics of Islamist groups. So, I should follow a similar approach but ensure variety.

Now, considering the facts, there are specific organizations and individuals, but since the user emphasized using the abstract and triplas, maybe the focus should be more on the abstract. However, some facts might be useful, like mentioning specific groups, but the user's instruction says to use the abstract, triplas, and few-shots as the base. The triplas here are the facts listed, which include various groups and their ideologies. But the main context is the abstract.

Wait, the user says to use the abstract, triplas, and few-shots. The triplas here are the facts listed. So, perhaps some questions can be about the groups associated with Islamism, like "Quais grupos estão associados ao islamismo?" but the answer would be a list, which might be too long. However, the user's example includes groups like Hamas and Hezbollah, so maybe that's acceptable.

But the user's example answers are short, so maybe I should focus on the abstract more. Let me go back to the abstract. The key points are:

- Islamism is a political ideology aiming to reconstitute states according to Islamic principles.
- Strategies: revolutionary (state power) vs. reformist (grassroots).
- Emphasis on Sharia, Islamic unity, removal of non-Muslim influences (especially Western).
- Some analysts view it as identity politics.
- Not all Islamists are violent; some pursue peaceful means.
- Impact on the Middle East.
- Post-Arab Spring, some involved in democratic politics, others formed militant groups.

From these, possible questions:

1. What is the primary goal of Islamism?
   Answer: Reconstitute states according to Islamic principles.

2. What are the two main strategies of Islamism?
   Answer: Revolutionary and reformist.

3. What do Islamists aim to remove from the Muslim world?
   Answer: Non-Muslim influences, especially Western.

4. How do some analysts describe Islamism?
   Answer: Identity politics involving Muslim identity and community revival.

5. Do all Islamists support violence?
   Answer: No; some pursue peaceful political processes.

6. What impact have Islamist movements had on the Middle East?
   Answer: Altered the region more than any trend since independence.

7. What happened to some Islamist currents after the Arab Spring?
   Answer: Involved in democratic politics or formed militant groups.

8. Which figure is associated with advocating violence in Islamism?
   Answer: Sayyid Qutb.

9. What does Islamism emphasize regarding Sharia?
   Answer: Implementation of Sharia.

10. What is a key difference between Islamic extremists and other Islamists?
    Answer: Extremists support violence; others use peaceful means.

Now, I need to check if these answers are directly from the context and concise. Also, ensure that answers are under 10 words. Let me verify each answer against the abstract.

1. Correct, as the abstract starts with that definition.
2. Yes, the strategies are revolutionary and reformist.
3. Yes, removal of non-Muslim influences, especially Western.
4. The abstract mentions identity politics with those aspects.
5. Correct, as some groups use peaceful means.
6. The abstract states they have arguably altered the Middle East more.
7. Post-Arab Spring, some involved in democratic politics, others formed militant groups like ISIL.
8. Sayyid Qutb is mentioned as advocating violence.
9. The emphasis is on implementation of Sharia.
10. The difference is between those who support violence and those who don't.

These seem acceptable. Now, I need to format them into CSV with questions and answers. Also, ensure that the answers are in quotes if necessary, but the user didn't specify that. The example uses quotes, so perhaps follow that.

Final check: Are all answers derived from the context? Yes. Are they concise? Yes. Are there 10 unique questions? Yes. Now, format accordingly.
