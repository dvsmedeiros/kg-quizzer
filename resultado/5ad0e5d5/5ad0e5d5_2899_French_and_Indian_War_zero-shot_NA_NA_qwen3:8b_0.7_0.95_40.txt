Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the provided context about the French and Indian War. Let me start by understanding the context thoroughly.

The context talks about the French and Indian War (1754–1763) as part of the Seven Years' War. It mentions the populations of French and British colonies, the involvement of Native American tribes, key battles like the Battle of Jumonville Glen and the Battle of the Monongahela, the role of figures like George Washington and Edward Braddock, the expulsion of Acadians, and the outcome with the Treaty of Paris 1763. Also, it notes that in the US, it's seen as a separate conflict from the European war.

Now, I need to create 10 relevant questions. Let me brainstorm possible questions:

1. What was the French and Indian War part of?
2. Which European war was the French and Indian War part of?
3. What was the population ratio between French and British colonies at the start?
4. Which Native American tribes supported the French?
5. What was the initial dispute that led to the war?
6. Who was the British commander in 1755?
7. What was the outcome of the Battle of the Monongahela?
8. Which treaty ended the French and Indian War?
9. What was the British strategy in capturing French Canada?
10. What were the French territories ceded to Britain after the war?

Now, I need to ensure the answers are concise (up to 10 words) and correct. Let me check each question against the context:

1. The Seven Years' War.
2. The Seven Years' War.
3. 60,000 vs 2 million.
4. Wabanaki Confederacy tribes, etc.
5. Dispute over the Forks of the Ohio.
6. General Edward Braddock.
7. Braddock died after the battle.
8. Treaty of Paris (1763).
9. Capturing territory and Quebec.
10. Territories east of Mississippi to Britain, Louisiana to Spain.

Wait, the answer for question 10 needs to be concise. Maybe "French territories east of Mississippi to Britain" and "Louisiana to Spain". But the answer should be short. Let me adjust.

Also, need to make sure the answers are accurate. Let me verify:

- The Seven Years' War is correct for question 1 and 2.
- Population ratio is 60k vs 2 million.
- Native tribes supporting French include Wabanaki, Algonquin, etc., so answer should list those.
- Initial dispute is the Forks of the Ohio.
- Braddock was the commander.
- Battle of Monongahela resulted in his death.
- Treaty of Paris 1763.
- British strategy: capturing Quebec and Montreal.
- Ceded territories: east of Mississippi to Britain, Louisiana to Spain.

Now, I need to phrase each question and answer correctly in Portuguese, keeping answers under 10 words. Let me translate and format them accordingly.
