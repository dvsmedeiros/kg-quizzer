Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to generate 10 CSV question-answer pairs based on the provided context about the Black Death. First, I need to parse the context and the facts to identify key points.

Looking at the context, the main points are: the Black Death was a bubonic plague pandemic from 1346-1353, caused by Yersinia pestis, spread by fleas and rats, originated in Central or East Asia, spread via Genoese ships, had a death toll of 75-200 million, reduced Europe's population by 30-60%, and had lasting effects on society and economy. There's also mention of the 1330s surge in Kyrgyzstan and the 19th-century recurrences.

Now, the facts include details like the number of deaths (75 million to 200 million), the bacterium (Yersinia pestis), the spread via fleas and rats, the origin in Central or East Asia, the impact on Europe's population, and the recurrence until the 19th century.

I need to make sure each question is unique and covers different aspects. Let's start with the time period, then the cause, spread, origin, death toll, impact on population, recurrence, economic effects, social effects, and the discovery in Kyrgyzstan.

Check for repetition. For example, the origin is mentioned in the context and facts, so I can ask about that once. The spread via ships is another point. The economic and social upheaval is mentioned in the context, so that's another question. The discovery in Kyrgyzstan is a specific point from the context. The number of deaths is in the facts. The impact on population is covered, and the recurrence until the 19th century.

Make sure the answers are concise, under 10 words. Use the exact numbers and terms from the context. Avoid overlapping questions. Let me list them out and then format into CSV.
