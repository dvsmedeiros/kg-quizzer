Okay, the user wants me to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the provided context. Let me start by understanding the context given.

The context talks about economic inequality, covering income and wealth distribution, Gini coefficient, inequality-adjusted Human Development Index, and its effects on political and social stability. It also mentions that globalization reduced global inequality but increased within-nation inequality. There's a mention of Branko Milanović and Richard G. Wilkinson working in this area, and some examples like the 1970s peak in income inequality between countries.

Now, I need to create 10 unique questions that are relevant to this context. The answers should be concise, up to 10 words, and based on the information provided. Let me brainstorm possible questions.

First, the Gini coefficient is mentioned as a widely used measure. So a question about that could be: "What is a widely used measure of economic inequality?" Answer: Gini coefficient.

Next, the context says that income inequality between nations peaked in the 1970s. So a question about when that peak occurred: "When did income inequality between nations peak?" Answer: 1970s.

The text also states that globalization reduced global inequality but increased within-nation inequality. So a question about that: "What effect did globalization have on global and within-nation inequality?" Answer: Reduced global; increased within-nation.

Another point is that 90% of advanced economies saw increased income inequality. So: "What percentage of advanced economies saw increased income inequality?" Answer: 90%.

The context mentions that inequality affects growth and stability, so: "What does greater inequality hinder?" Answer: Economic growth and macroeconomic stability.

The text also talks about the Inequality-adjusted Human Development Index. A question: "What index takes inequality into account?" Answer: Inequality-adjusted Human Development Index.

There's a mention of the 1% richest having half the global wealth. So: "What percentage of global wealth do the 1% richest have?" Answer: Half.

The context states that 70% of countries had Gini coefficients increasing by more than two points. So: "What percentage of countries saw Gini coefficients rise by over two points?" Answer: 70%.

The text says that inequality is central to economic policy debates. So: "What is the focus of economic policy debates on inequality?" Answer: Central.

Lastly, the text mentions that economic inequality is a type of social issue. So: "What type of issue is economic inequality?" Answer: Social issue.

I need to check if these questions are all different and based on the context. Also, ensure that the answers are accurate and derived from the provided text. Let me verify each one against the context.

Yes, all the answers are directly from the text. The questions cover different aspects: measures, historical context, effects, statistics, and types. I think this meets the user's requirements. Now, format them into CSV with the correct separators.
