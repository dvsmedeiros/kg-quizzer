Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the given context about Harvard University. Let me start by reading through the context and the facts provided to make sure I understand the key points.

First, the context mentions that Harvard was founded in 1636 as Harvard College, named after John Harvard. It's the oldest institution in the US, has a large endowment, three campuses, and is known for its academic prestige. There are details about its faculties, libraries, notable alumni, and historical figures like Charles W. Eliot and James B. Conant. The facts list various people associated with Harvard, including alumni, faculty, and their affiliations.

Now, I need to create 10 unique questions with short answers. Let me brainstorm possible questions:

1. When was Harvard University founded? The context says 1636 as Harvard College, so the answer would be 1636.
2. Who is Harvard named after? John Harvard, as mentioned in the abstract.
3. What is the largest academic library system? Harvard Library, with 79 libraries.
4. How many campuses does Harvard have? The context mentions three: Cambridge, Allston, and Longwood.
5. Who was the president during the Great Depression and WWII? James B. Conant.
6. How many Nobel laureates are alumni? The context says 150, but the example shows 150, so that's a possible answer.
7. What is Harvard's endowment value? $50.9 billion.
8. Who founded the Association of American Universities with Harvard? The context says Harvard co-founded it in 1900, so the answer is Harvard.
9. Which president transformed Harvard into a research university? Charles W. Eliot, mentioned in the context.
10. How many U.S. presidents are Harvard alumni? The example says eight, so that's a valid answer.

Wait, the example in the user's message has "oito presidentes dos EUA" for the question about U.S. presidents. So I need to make sure the answers are in Portuguese and concise. Let me check each answer to ensure they are under 10 words and correct.

I need to avoid repeating similar questions. For example, don't ask about the same person multiple times. Also, check that each answer is directly from the context or inferable. For instance, the endowment is $50.9 billion, so that's a direct answer. The number of campuses is three, so that's straightforward.

Let me list out the 10 pairs now, ensuring they are varied and correct.
