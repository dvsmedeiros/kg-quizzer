Okay; so I need to generate a CSV based on the given RDF data about Harvard University and its alumni. Let me think through how to approach this.
- "Você é um..." is just a greeting; not relevant.
- The block about Harvard University sets its type and sports affiliations; but that's not needed for the CSV.
Wait; the example provided in the initial answer had "Cargo" as "Alumni". So perhaps that's a standard for those without specific roles listed.
- The CSV should handle special characters in names properly; possibly using UTF-8 encoding.
I think I'm ready to structure this CSV now; making sure each column is correctly labeled and filled with the extracted data.
