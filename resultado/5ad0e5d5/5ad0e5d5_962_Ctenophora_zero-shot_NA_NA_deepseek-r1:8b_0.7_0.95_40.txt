Okay, I need to help create 10 question-answer pairs in Portuguese based on the provided context about ctenophores. Let me start by carefully reading through the context to identify key points that can be turned into relevant questions.

First, I notice that ctenophores are known as comb jellies and are marine invertebrates. They use cilia for swimming. That's a good fact for a question about their mode of movement.

Next, the text mentions that adult sizes range from millimeters to 1.5 meters. This can be used to ask about typical size ranges.

The phylum includes various forms like cydippids with egg-shaped bodies and tentacles with colloblasts for capturing prey. That's another key point for a question about body structure or diet.

It also talks about the textbook example, cydippids, having retractable tentacles covered in colloblasts. This can form a question about their body features.

The text mentions that almost all ctenophores are predators, preying on microscopic organisms and small crustaceans. However, two species' juveniles live as parasites on salps. This can be used to ask about their feeding habits or exceptions.

There's a mention of fossils dating back to the early Cambrian, about 525 million years ago. This fact can form a question about fossil evidence or historical presence.

The position of ctenophores in the evolutionary tree is debated, with some theories suggesting they are sister to sponges (Porifera Sister Hypothesis) and others that sponges appeared earlier (Ctenophora Sister Hypothesis). This can be turned into a question about their phylogenetic relationships.

The mention of studies by Pisani et al. and Whelan et al. discussing gene differences and supporting different hypotheses can form a question about molecular phylogenetics or taxonomic disputes.

I should ensure each question is relevant and the answers are concise, up to 10 words. Let me list out possible questions based on these points:

1. What is a key feature of ctenophores for movement?
2. How big do adult ctenophores typically grow?
3. Which phylum includes comb jellies?
4. What structure helps them capture prey?
5. Are most ctenophores predators or parasites?
6. What body form does cydippids have?
7. What is a notable feature of their bodies?
8. How old are fossils of ctenophores?
9. What hypothesis suggests they are sister to sponges?
10. How do molecular studies contribute to phylogenetic debates?

Now, I'll craft each question and ensure the answers are accurate based on the context.
