Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the provided context about the Black Death. Let me start by reading through the context carefully to understand the key points.

The context mentions the Black Death was a bubonic plague pandemic from 1346 to 1353, causing 75-200 million deaths. It started in Central or East Asia, spread via Genoese ships to Crimea, then to Europe. The plague had different forms, like pneumonic, which spread person-to-person. There's also mention of a surge in Kyrgyzstan in the late 1330s, suggesting the origin might not be linked to Mongol conquests as previously thought. The population in Europe dropped by 30-60%, and it took until 1500 to recover. The plague had social, economic, and religious impacts.

Now, I need to create varied questions. Let me list possible topics: origin, spread, death toll, impact, transmission, dates, and related facts. I should avoid repeating similar questions. For each question, the answer must be concise and directly from the context.

First question: Origin. The context says it originated in Central Asia or East Asia. That's a good start. Answer: Central Asia or East Asia.

Next, the start date. The context mentions 1346. So, "When did the Black Death start?" Answer: 1346.

Transmission method: Bubonic plague caused by Yersinia pestis via fleas. But there's also pneumonic spread. Maybe ask about the primary vector. Answer: fleas living on black rats.

Death toll: The context states 75-200 million. So, "How many people did the Black Death kill?" Answer: 75–200 million.

Impact on Europe's population: 30-60% died. "What percentage of Europe's population died?" Answer: 30 a 60% da população total da Europa.

Spread to Europe: Via Genoese ships from Crimea. "How did the Black Death reach Europe?" Answer: Genoese ships.

Pneumonic plague spread: Person-to-person. "How did the plague spread inland quickly?" Answer: pneumonic plague.

Kyrgyzstan surge: Late 1330s. "When did the Black Death surge in Kyrgyzstan?" Answer: late 1330s.

Recovery time: Until 1500. "When did Europe's population recover?" Answer: 1500.

Plague's end: Early 19th century. "When did plague outbreaks stop?" Answer: early 19th century.

Wait, the context says outbreaks recurred until the early 19th century. So that's a valid question. Let me check if these are all distinct and cover different aspects. I think that's 10. Now, format them as CSV with semicolons, ensuring answers are under 10 words. Also, check for any repetition. Looks good. Let me put them in order and ensure correct formatting.
