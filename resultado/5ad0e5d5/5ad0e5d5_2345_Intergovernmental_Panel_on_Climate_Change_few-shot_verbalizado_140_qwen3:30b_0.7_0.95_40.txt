Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs in Portuguese based on the given context about the IPCC. Let me start by reading through the context and the facts provided.

First, the context mentions that the IPCC is part of the United Nations, established by the WMO and UNEP in 1988. It has 195 member states, a secretariat in Geneva, and works through working groups. The IPCC doesn't do original research but compiles reports. They've had several assessment cycles, with the sixth ending in 2023. Notable people include Hoesung Lee as the current chair, Bert Bolin as a former president, and the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize. The reports influence agreements like the Paris Agreement.

Looking at the facts, there are details like the headquarters in Geneva, the chairperson's name, the establishment year, and the organizations involved. I should make sure each question is unique and covers different aspects. Let me brainstorm possible questions:

1. Which UN organization is the IPCC part of? (Answer: United Nations)
2. When was the IPCC established? (Answer: 1988)
3. Who are the founding organizations? (WMO and UNEP)
4. Where is the secretariat located? (Geneva, Switzerland)
5. How many member states does it have? (195)
6. Who is the current chair? (Hoesung Lee)
7. What is the main purpose of the IPCC? (Assess climate change science)
8. What is the sixth assessment cycle's completion year? (2023)
9. Which Nobel Prize did the IPCC share? (2007 Peace Prize)
10. What is the IPCC's abbreviation? (IPCC)

Now, check if these are all covered in the context. The context says the IPCC is part of the UN, established in 1988 by WMO and UNEP, secretariat in Geneva, 195 members, Hoesung Lee as chair, purpose is advancing scientific knowledge, sixth cycle ends 2023, shared 2007 Nobel, and abbreviation IPCC. Yes, all these points are there. Now, make sure the answers are concise, under 10 words. Also, avoid repetition. The example given has questions about the UN, founding organizations, location, member states, chair, purpose, cycle completion, Nobel, and abbreviation. That's 9, so need one more. Maybe a question about the main function or a specific report. Wait, the context mentions the Paris Agreement and the Synthesis Report in 2023. Maybe a question about the Synthesis Report's release date. But the user's example had questions about the Nobel and the chair. Let me check the facts again. There's a fact that the IPCC is part of the UN, so the first question is covered. The second question about the establishment year. Third, founding organizations. Fourth, secretariat location. Fifth, member states. Sixth, current chair. Seventh, purpose. Eighth, sixth cycle completion. Ninth, Nobel Prize. Tenth, abbreviation. That's 10. Now, check for uniqueness and correct answers. Each answer should be directly from the context. For example, the answer to the purpose is "advance scientific knowledge about climate change caused by human activities." But the user's example had "assess climate change science" as a shorter answer. So maybe "avaliar o conhecimento científico sobre mudanças climáticas" in Portuguese. But the user's examples have answers like "as Nações Unidas," so maybe keep it short. Let me translate each answer accordingly.

Now, structure each line as "pergunta;resposta" with semicolons. Make sure no markdown, just plain CSV. Check for 10 lines. Avoid any repetition. For example, the user's example had questions about the UN, founding organizations, location, member states, chair, purpose, cycle, Nobel, and abbreviation. That's 9, so the 10th could be about the Synthesis Report or the working groups. But the context mentions three working groups. So maybe a question about the number of working groups. Let me check the context: "The IPCC has three working groups and a task force." So a question could be "Quantos grupos de trabalho o IPCC possui?" with answer "três grupos de trabalho." But the user's examples don't have that. Alternatively, the 10th question could be about the main function, which was covered. Wait, the user's example had "O que a ONU quer estabilizar?" but that's not in the context. So maybe adjust. Let me finalize the 10 questions:

1. De que organização o IPCC faz parte?;as Nações Unidas
2. Quando o IPCC foi estabelecido?;1988
3. Quais organizações da ONU estabeleceram o IPCC?;a Organização Meteorológica Mundial (OMM) e o Programa das Nações Unidas para o Meio Ambiente (PNUMA)
4. Onde está localizado o secretariado do IPCC?;Genebra, Suíça
5. Quantos países membros o IPCC possui?;195 países
6. Quem é o atual presidente do IPCC?;Hoesung Lee
7. Qual é o principal objetivo do IPCC?;avaliar o conhecimento científico sobre mudanças climáticas
8. Em que ano terminou o ciclo de avaliação seis?;2023
9. Qual prêmio Nobel o IPCC compartilhou?;Prêmio Nobel da Paz de 2007
10. Qual é a abreviação do IPCC?;IPCC

Check if all answers are within 10 words. Each seems okay. Ensure the facts are correctly represented. The context says the secretariat is in Geneva, Switzerland, so that's correct. The founding organizations are WMO and UNEP. The answer for the purpose is "avaliar o conhecimento científico sobre mudanças climáticas" which is accurate. The sixth cycle ends in 2023. The Nobel is 2007. The abbreviation is IPCC. Yes, all correct. Avoid any markdown, just the CSV lines. That should meet the user's requirements.
