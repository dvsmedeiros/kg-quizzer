Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the provided context and facts. Let me start by understanding the context.

The context talks about economic inequality, including income and wealth distribution, the Gini coefficient, inequality-adjusted Human Development Index, and how globalization affects inequality. It also mentions that inequality within nations has increased, especially in advanced countries, and that inequality is a key topic in economic policy.

The facts include various entities and concepts related to economic inequality, like the Gini coefficient, the Inequality-adjusted Human Development Index, and some scholars or movements associated with it. I need to make sure the questions are varied and cover different aspects of the topic.

First, I'll list possible questions. The example given includes questions about percentages, specific figures, and the impact of inequality. I should ensure that each question is unique and covers different aspects: income vs. wealth, Gini coefficient, effects on countries, social stability, economic growth, and policy measures.

I need to check that each answer is a short phrase, up to 10 words, and directly inferred from the context. Also, avoid repeating similar questions. Let me think of 10 different angles:

1. What's the main measure of wealth inequality?
2. What's the effect of globalization on global and national inequality?
3. What percentage of advanced economies saw increased income inequality?
4. What's the main cause of economic instability linked to inequality?
5. What's the impact of land and human capital inequality on growth?
6. What's the key policy tool to reduce income inequality?
7. What's the main focus of the Inequality-adjusted Human Development Index?
8. What's the trend in global inequality between nations?
9. What's the effect of inequality on economic growth?
10. What's the main focus of the Gini coefficient?

Now, I'll check if these are covered in the context. The context mentions Gini coefficient, Inequality-adjusted Human Development Index, effects of globalization, policy measures like taxes and transfers, and the link between inequality and economic growth. Also, the trend in global inequality between nations peaked in the 70s and has been converging. 

I need to make sure each answer is a concise phrase. Let me structure each pair accordingly, ensuring they are in Portuguese and follow the CSV format. Also, check that the answers are correct based on the context provided.
