Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the provided context about economic inequality. Let me start by understanding the context thoroughly. The text talks about different types of economic inequality like income and wealth inequality, measurement methods such as the Gini coefficient and the Inequality-adjusted Human Development Index, and the effects of inequality on growth and stability. It also mentions globalization's role in reducing global inequality but increasing within-country inequality, and how tax policies affect income distribution.

First, I'll identify key points and concepts. For example, the Gini coefficient is a major measurement method. There's also the Inequality-adjusted Human Development Index. The text mentions that income inequality peaked in the 1970s and has since converged, but within-nation inequality has risen. The link between inequality and economic growth is highlighted, as well as the role of taxes and transfers in reducing inequality.

Now, I need to create 10 questions. Each question should be concise and target a specific piece of information from the context. The answers must be short, up to 10 words. Let me brainstorm possible questions:

1. What is a widely used measure of economic inequality?
   Answer: Gini coefficient.

2. What index considers inequality in human development?
   Answer: Inequality-adjusted Human Development Index.

3. When did global income inequality peak?
   Answer: 1970s.

4. How has globalization affected inequality between nations?
   Answer: Reduced global inequality.

5. What has increased significantly in advanced countries?
   Answer: Income inequality.

6. What is a key factor linking inequality to economic growth?
   Answer: Political and social instability.

7. What policy tools reduce income inequality?
   Answer: Taxes and transfers.

8. What is a concept related to equality of opportunity?
   While the text mentions equity, equality of outcome, and equality of opportunity, the question should be specific. Maybe: What is a key concept of equality? Answer: Equity.

Wait, the context says "Important concepts of equality include equity, equality of outcome, and equality of opportunity." So a question like "What is an important concept of equality?" Answer: Equity.

9. What effect does greater inequality have on economic growth?
   Answer: Hinders economic growth.

10. What is the primary method for measuring wealth inequality?
    Answer: Distribution of wealth.

Wait, the first sentence mentions income inequality measured by income distribution and wealth inequality by wealth distribution. So the answer for the question about wealth inequality measurement would be "Distribution of wealth."

Let me check the answers to ensure they are under 10 words and accurate. Also, ensure the questions are clear and directly related to the context. Once I have the 10 pairs, I'll format them into CSV with semicolons as separators, without any extra text.
