I think it's best to list each religion separated by a comma under the Religions column. Same with languages and currencies. That way; the CSV remains clean and easy to read.
Now; putting it all together:
- Currencies: Predominantly Paper Currency; Chinese cash
- Common Languages: Chinese language; Middle Mongol
Once I'm confident with the data; I can format it into a CSV structure as specified.
- **Formatting:** Ensures that the data is consistent and easy to read; with proper separation of values.
