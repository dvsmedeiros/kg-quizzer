Okay, I need to help the user generate a 10-question and answer CSV based on the provided context and facts about the European Union law. Let me start by understanding what's required.

First, the user wants each question paired with an immediate correct short answer in Portuguese, all in CSV format. They also mentioned that the questions should be varied and cover the context well. The output should have exactly 10 lines without any repetition of similar questions.

Looking at the context, it talks about the EU's legal system, its history since 1952, purpose (peace, social justice, etc.), the Treaties involved in forming its constitution, and how EU law is interpreted by the Court of Justice. There are some DBpedia facts provided, which might relate to sub-disciplines or fields within law.

I should create questions that cover different aspects: definitions, origins, purposes, key institutions (like the Court of Justice), notable legal scholars associated with EU law, and perhaps academic disciplines involved.

Let me start drafting each question one by one:

1. **Definition Question**: A straightforward question about what EU law is.
2. **Historical Context**: When it was founded—1952 seems right based on the context.
3. **Institutional Query**: Who interprets EU law? The Court of Justice fits here.
4. **Academic Aspect**: Academic discipline related to EU law can be Law of the European Union.
5. **Notable Figures**: A known legal scholar associated with EU law, like Henry G. Schermers.
6. **Specific Treaties**: The Treaties that form its constitutional structure—maybe the Treaty on European Union (TEU), but since it's not directly in the facts, I can infer.
7. **Origin Purpose**: Primary reason for establishing EU law—peace and social justice make sense.
8. **Market Focus**: Promotes a social market economy with full employment as stated.
9. **Implementation**: Created by which branch of the EU? Judicial creates EU case law via the Court of Justice.
10. **Academic Field**: Another possible sub-discipline mentioned in facts—John Bell's field.

I need to ensure each question is unique and not repetitive, so I'll vary them as much as possible across different areas: definitions, history, institutions, notable figures, academic aspects, etc.

Now, translating these ideas into questions with clear answers based on the context. Each answer should be a single word or two words, fitting the requirement for short responses.
