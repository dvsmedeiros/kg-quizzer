Okay, so I need to create 10 pairs of questions and answers in a CSV format based on the given context about Harvard University. The instructions specify that each line should have a question followed by a correct answer, using a semicolon as the separator, all in Portuguese.

First, I'll read through the context provided to understand what information is available. The context includes details about Harvard's founding, its structure, notable people associated with it, achievements, and other facts.

I notice that the context mentions several key points:
- Founded in 1636 as Harvard College.
- Named after John Harvard, the first benefactor.
- It's a private Ivy League university.
- The library system is the largest academic one, with 79 libraries and about 20.4 million items.
- Charles W. Eliot transformed it into a modern research university.
- James B. Conant led during the Great Depression and WWII.
- Harvard has educated eight U.S. presidents and many Nobel laureates.

The facts section lists a lot of individuals who are alumni or have associations with Harvard, which could be useful for questions about notable people.

I should create varied questions that touch on different aspects: history, structure, achievements, notable individuals, etc. Each question needs to have one correct answer based on the context.

Let me brainstorm possible questions:
1. When was Harvard University founded?
2. Who is it named after?
3. What's the main library system's name?
4. How many libraries are in the main system?
5. Which president transformed it into a research university?
6. Under whose leadership did it become coeducational?
7. How many U.S. presidents are alumni?
8. How many Nobel laureates are there among alumni?
9. When was the library system established?
10. What's Harvard's endowment size?

Wait, looking at the example provided by the user, they have questions like "Qual indivíduo recebeu o nome da escola?" which translates to "Which individual was the school named after?" and the answer is John Harvard.

I should follow that style, using Portuguese for both questions and answers. Each question should be clear and direct, with an unambiguous correct answer from the context.

Now, I'll structure each line in the CSV accordingly, making sure not to repeat similar questions and covering a broad range of topics related to Harvard.
