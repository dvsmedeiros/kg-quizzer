Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the provided context about the Huguenots. Let me start by understanding the context thoroughly.

First, the Huguenots were French Protestants, part of the Reformed Church, and they had a significant presence in southern and central France. The term "Huguenot" is derived from a Swiss leader, Bezanson Hugues. The Wars of Religion occurred from 1562 to 1598, ending with the Edict of Nantes in 1598, which granted them autonomy. Key figures include Jeanne d'Albret, Henry IV, and the Princes of Condé. The Edict of Fontainebleau in 1685 revoked Protestant rights, leading to further persecution. The Huguenots faced a decline in numbers, with many fleeing as refugees, contributing to a brain drain. The Edict of Versailles in 1787 ended persecution, and the Revolution of 1789 granted equal rights to Protestants.

Now, I need to create 10 distinct questions, each with a unique answer, all in Portuguese. The answers should be concise, up to 10 words. Let me brainstorm possible questions.

1. Where were the Huguenots mainly located in France? (Answer: southern and central France)
2. What was the term "Huguenot" originally derived from? (Answer: Swiss leader Bezanson Hugues)
3. When did the French Wars of Religion take place? (Answer: 1562 to 1598)
4. Which treaty ended the French Wars of Religion? (Answer: Edict of Nantes)
5. What did the Edict of Nantes grant to the Huguenots? (Answer: autonomy in religion, politics, and military)
6. What was the name of the conspiracy to overthrow the House of Guise? (Answer: Amboise)
7. When did the Amboise conspiracy occur? (Answer: 1560)
8. Who was a key leader of the Huguenots? (Answer: Jeanne d'Albret)
9. What was the result of the Huguenot rebellions in the 1620s? (Answer: abolition of their privileges)
10. When did the persecution of Huguenots end officially? (Answer: Edict of Versailles in 1787)

I need to check if these questions are all based on the given context and if the answers are accurate. Also, ensure no repetition and that each answer is within the word limit. Let me verify each point against the provided text.

For example, the term "Huguenot" comes from the Swiss leader, which is mentioned. The Wars of Religion are from 1562-1598. The Edict of Nantes granted autonomy. The Amboise conspiracy is mentioned as a conspiracy to take over the House of Guise. The answer about the Edict of Versailles is correct as per the text. The brain drain part is mentioned, but the question about when persecution ended is covered by the Edict of Versailles in 1787.

I think these are all valid. Now, format them into CSV without any markdown, just the lines separated by semicolons.
