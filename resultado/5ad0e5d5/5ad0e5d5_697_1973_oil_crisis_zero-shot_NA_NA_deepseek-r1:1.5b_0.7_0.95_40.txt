Okay, I need to create a set of 10 questions based on the provided context about the 1973 oil crisis. Let me read through the context again carefully.

First, it mentions that the members of OAPEC, led by Saudi Arabia, declared an oil embargo starting in October 1973. The goal of this embargo was to prevent nations like Canada, Japan, and the United States from supporting Israel during the Yom Kippur War. However, the embargo expanded to other countries too.

I should think about key aspects or events that happened as a result of the oil embargo. Maybe questions about what happened with specific nations involved in the embargo. Also, I need to mention the broader effects on global politics and the economy.

Let me list out some important points:

1. The emergence of the OAPEC oil embargo.
2. The countries targeted towards support for Israel during Yom Kippur War.
3. The initial countries affected by the embargo.
4. How the embargo caused prices to rise, leading to the oil crisis.
5. The term "first oil shock."
6. The second oil shock in 1979.

Now, I can structure each question around these points. Each question should ask about a specific event or effect related to the oil crisis.

Let me think of possible questions:

- What nations were targeted by the OAPEC oil embargo for support in Israel's war?
- How did the initial countries affected by the oil embargo drive prices to nearly $12 per barrel, leading to significant price increases globally?
- Who supported Israel during Yom Kippur War, and was part of the OAPEC oil embargo targeting them?

I should ensure each question is clear and relevant. I also need to answer each in a concise manner, under 10 words.

Let me check for clarity:

1. "Nations targeted by OAPEC oil embargo for Israel's war support."
2. "Why did the initial countries affected drive prices up nearly $12?"
3. "Did nations supporting Israel assist in the OAPEC oil embargo targeting them?"

I think these cover different angles of the context provided and are concise enough for a quiz.
