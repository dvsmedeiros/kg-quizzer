Okay, I need to create a dataset with 10 pairs of questions and answers based on the provided context about oxygen. First, I'll read through the text carefully to identify relevant scientific facts.

The first question could be about the symbol of oxygen. According to the text, oxygen is represented by O and has an atomic number of 8. So, the pair would be "What is the symbol for oxygen?" with answer "O".

Next, the text mentions that oxygen makes up almost half of Earth's crust as oxides. So, a good question here might ask about carbon dioxide content in the crust. That way, the answer can directly relate to the given information.

Moving on, the text talks about photosynthesis producing oxygen from water and carbon dioxide. This is crucial because it shows how oxygen is utilized by plants. A question about this process would be appropriate.

I also recall that oxygen was first identified by Joseph Priestley in 1774. So, a question asking who discovered oxygen would fit well, with the answer being "Joseph Priestley".

The text mentions that ozone absorbs UVB radiation and helps protect the biosphere, but it's also stated that ozone is a pollutant at the surface as a byproduct of smog. This provides two related questions about ozone.

Another key point is that oxygen was first recognized by Antoine Lavoisier in 1777. So, questioning who he was would be relevant here.

The context includes how oxygen is used in various industries and its role in life support systems. A question about industrial applications could link to this context.

Lastly, the text explains that oxygen is a reactive element needing continuous replenishment. This leads to a question asking about sources of oxygen in Earth's atmosphere beyond photosynthesis.

Now, I need to structure each pair with a clear title and answer, ensuring they are concise and within the word limit. Each question should be straightforward, and the answers directly relate to the provided information without adding extra details.
