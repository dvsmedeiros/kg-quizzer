Okay, so I'm trying to create a quiz based on the information provided about the Huguenots. The user wants 10 question-answer pairs in Portuguese, formatted as CSV with each pair separated by a semicolon. 

First, I'll read through the context carefully to identify key points that can form the basis of questions and answers. Let's break down the main sections:

1. **Definition and Origin**: Huguenots were French Protestants following Calvinism. The term might come from Bezanson Hugues.
2. **Timeline and Events**:
   - Mid-16th century: Term came into common use.
   - 1572: St. Bartholomew's Day massacre, where Huguenots made up about 10% of France.
   - 1600: Declined to 7-8%.
   - Louis XIV (1685): Edict of Fontainebleau revoked Protestant rights.
3. **Persecution and Migration**:
   - Dragonnades: Forced conversions.
   - Many Huguenots fled, leading to a brain drain as they were influential in society.
4. **Rebellion and Aftermath**:
   - Henry IV (originally a Huguenot) converted to Catholicism to become king.
   - Edict of Nantes granted autonomy but was later revoked.
5. **Decline and Revival**:
   - By 1774, Calvinism nearly eliminated in France.
   - Edict of Versailles (1787) ended persecution; Declaration of Rights (1789) gave Protestants equal rights.

Now, I'll think of questions that cover these points. Each question should be clear and directly related to the facts. The answers need to be concise, up to 10 words in Portuguese.

Let's draft some:

1. **Origin of the Term "Huguenot"**: Where does the term come from? Answer: From Bezanson Hugues.
2. **When Did the Term Gain Popularity?** Around mid-16th century.
3. **Who Were the French Wars of Religion Between?** Huguenots and Catholics, from 1562 to 1598.
4. **Key Leaders of Huguenots**: Jeanne d'Albret, Henry IV, princes of Condé.
5. **Edict of Nantes Outcome**: Granted religious, political, military autonomy.
6. **Huguenot Numbers Before Persecution (1572)**: About 10% of France's population.
7. **Effect of Edict of Fontainebleau (1685)**: Ended Protestant recognition in France.
8. **Dragonades' Impact**: Forced conversions, devastated community.
9. **After Louis XIV's Rule (1774)**: Calvinism nearly eliminated.
10. **Edict of Versailles (1787)**: Ended persecution of Protestants.

I'll ensure each question is distinct and covers different aspects. Also, check that answers are accurate based on the context. I need to make sure Portuguese terms are correctly translated, especially names and titles like "Edito de Nantes" or "Dragonadas".

Now, compiling these into the CSV format as specified.
