Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs in Portuguese based on the given context about British Satellite Broadcasting (BSB). Let me start by understanding the context and the facts provided.

First, the abstract says BSB was a TV company in London, started broadcasting on March 25, 1990, and merged with Sky Television on November 2, 1990, to form British Sky Broadcasting. The facts include various triples with information about BSB's ownership, companies it's related to, founding dates, locations, and more.

Now, I need to create questions that are varied and cover different aspects. Let me list possible points:

1. When was BSB founded? The founding date is 1986, as per the facts.
2. Where was BSB headquartered? The abstract mentions London.
3. What year did BSB start broadcasting? March 25, 1990.
4. When was BSB merged with Sky Television? November 2, 1990.
5. What company was BSB merged with? Sky Television plc.
6. What is the successor of BSB? Sky UK.
7. What is the name of the merged company? British Sky Broadcasting.
8. What categories does BSB belong to? The subject categories include things like "Category:British companies established in 1986".
9. What are some channels owned by BSB? Galaxy, Now, The Computer Channel, etc.
10. What is the legal classification of BSB? It's a company, so "Company" or "Organization".

I need to make sure each question is unique and the answers are concise, under 10 words. Also, check that answers are inferable from the context.

Let me draft each pair:

1. When was British Satellite Broadcasting founded? - 1986
2. Where was British Satellite Broadcasting headquartered? - Londres
3. When did BSB start broadcasting? - 25 de março de 1990
4. When was BSB merged with Sky Television? - 2 de novembro de 1990
5. What company did BSB merge with? - Sky Television plc
6. What is the successor of BSB? - Sky UK
7. What was the result of the merger? - British Sky Broadcasting
8. What category includes BSB's founding year? - Empresas britânicas fundadas em 1986
9. Which channels were owned by BSB? - Galaxy, Now, The Computer Channel
10. What is BSB's legal classification? - Empresa

Wait, need to check if all answers are correct. For example, the founding date is 1986, but the foundingYear is 1986. The merger date is 2 November 1990. The successor is Sky UK. The merged company is British Sky Broadcasting. The categories include "Category:British companies established in 1986". Channels like Galaxy, Now, etc. The legal classification includes "Company" and "Organization".

I need to make sure the answers are short. For example, "British Satellite Broadcasting" is the name, but the question might be about the merged company. Also, check for any other possible facts. Maybe the location includes London and England. But the answer should be concise.

Double-check each answer against the context. For example, the "fate" property says "Merged with Sky Television plc to form BSkyB", so the successor is Sky UK. The merged company is British Sky Broadcasting.

I think these questions cover different aspects. Now, format them into CSV with semicolons.
