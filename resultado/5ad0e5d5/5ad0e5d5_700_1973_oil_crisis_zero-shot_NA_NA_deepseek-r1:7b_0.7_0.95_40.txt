Okay, I need to generate a quiz in the format of pairs with question and answer based on the given context about the 1973 oil crisis. The user wants me to create 10 such pairs. Let me first understand the key points from the context.

The oil crisis started in October 1973 when OAPEC, led by Saudi Arabia, declared an oil embargo targeting countries that supported Israel during the Yom Kippur War. Targeted nations included Canada, Japan, the Netherlands, the UK, and the US, among others. The price of oil rose from $3 to nearly $12 per barrel by March 1974, leading to a significant impact on global politics and economy.

So, for each question, I need to make sure it's relevant to this context. Each answer should be a short phrase, up to 10 words, in Portuguese without any markdown formatting.

Let me start brainstorming questions:

1. When did the 1973 oil crisis begin? - Answer: Outubro de 1973
2. Which country led the oil embargo in the 1973 crisis? - Answer: Saudi Arabia
3. The oil embargo was targeted at which countries supporting Israel during Yom Kippur War? - Answer: Canadário;Japão;Netherlands;Reino Unido; Estados Unidos
Wait, I should check if it's "Canadário" correctly in Portuguese. Maybe "Canada", but the user wants Portuguese answers.

Ah right, so "Canadário" is correct because the original list includes Canada as a target country.

4. By when was the price of oil significantly increased? - Answer: Fim de março de 1974
5. What were the main effects of the oil crisis on global politics and economy? - Answer: Efeitos políticos e econômicos significativos
6. Which regions saw major impacts from the oil crisis in both short-term and long-term? - Answer: Geralmente afetaram os globais
7. The oil crisis was later called... - Answer: Primeira crise do petróleo
8. What year did the second oil crisis occur? - Answer: 1979
Wait, but in the context, it says "It was later called the 'first oil shock', followed by the 1979 oil crisis..." So maybe I should structure that as a question.

Hmm, perhaps rephrase to avoid duplication. Let me think of another way.

Alternatively:

8. What is the second oil crisis known as? - Answer: Segunda crise do petróleo
Wait, but in English it's called the "second oil shock". So maybe better to frame it as a translation.

But since the user wants Portuguese answers, I'll stick with Portuguese terms.

9. How much did oil prices rise by March 1974? - Answer: Aumentou cerca de 300%
Wait, exact numbers are given: from $3 to nearly $12, which is an increase of about $9 or 300% based on the initial $3.

But "cerca de 300%" is more accurate than exactly 300%.

So, maybe answer: Aumentou cerca de 300%

10. Which nations were initially targeted by the oil embargo? - Answer: Canadário;Japão;Netherlands;Reino Unido; Estados Unidos

Wait, I should check if "Canadário" is correctly translated as "Canada", but in Portuguese it's "Canadário". So to avoid confusion, perhaps just list them as Canada, Japan, Netherlands, UK, US.

Alternatively, use the original terms. Let me see:

The context says: "initial nations targeted were Canada, Japan, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and the United States"

So in Portuguese answers, it's better to write "Canadário;Japão;Netherlands;Reino Unido; Estados Unidos" but that may have a translation issue. Wait, "United Kingdom" is "Reino Unido", and "United States" as "Estados Unidos".

But if I want to be precise in Portuguese terms, perhaps it's better to use "Reino Unido" instead of "Estados Unidos". Alternatively, just stick with the original terms.

Wait, but I should ensure that each term is correctly translated into Portuguese. For example:

Canada → Canadário
Japan → Japão
Netherlands → Netherlands (already in English)
United Kingdom → Reino Unido
United States → Estados Unidos

So the answer would be: Canadário;Japão;Netherlands;Reino Unido; Estados Unidos.

But that might confuse some people because "Canadário" is an adjective, but it's correct as a country name in Portuguese.

Alternatively, perhaps write the full names to avoid confusion. But given the user’s example had "Outubro de 1973", I think using abbreviations with years is acceptable.

Wait, no, in the first question, the answer was "Outubro de 1973", so it's better to use that format for consistency.

So here are my final questions and answers:

1. When did the 1973 oil crisis begin?;Outubro de 1973
2. Which country led the oil embargo in the 1973 crisis?;Saudi Arabia
3. The oil embargo was targeted at which countries supporting Israel during Yom Kippur War?;Canadário;Japão;Netherlands;Reino Unido; Estados Unidos
4. By when was the price of oil significantly increased?;Fim de março de 1974
5. What were the main effects of the oil crisis on global politics and economy?;Efeitos políticos e econômicos significativos
6. Which regions saw major impacts from the oil crisis in both short-term and long-term?;Geralmente afetaram os globais
7. The oil crisis was later called...;Primeira crise do petróleo
8. What year did the second oil crisis occur?;1979
Wait, but according to the context, it's "the 1979 oil crisis" known as "the second oil shock". So maybe better to frame it as: What is the second oil crisis known as? Answer would be Segunda crise do petróleo.

But in the user’s example, he used a single term. Alternatively, perhaps just ask for the year.

Wait, let me check:

In the context provided by the user, after explaining the 1973 crisis, it says: "It was later called the 'first oil shock', followed by the 1979 oil crisis, termed the 'second oil shock'."

So he provides the timeline as 1973 (first), then 1979 (second). So perhaps I can frame a question about that.

Alternatively, another way could be:

What year did the second oil crisis occur?;1979

But in Portuguese: Qual o ano da segunda crise do petróleo?;1979

So if I proceed with this structure, let's adjust accordingly.

Let me rephrase some questions to avoid repetition or confusion. Here’s a more coherent list:

1. When did the 1973 oil crisis begin?;Outubro de 1973
2. Which country led the oil embargo in the 1973 crisis?;Saudi Arabia
3. The oil embargo was targeted at which countries supporting Israel during Yom Kippur War?;Canadário;Japão;Netherlands;Reino Unido; Estados Unidos
4. By when was the price of oil significantly increased?;Fim de março de 1974
5. What were the main effects of the oil crisis on global politics and economy?;Efeitos políticos e econômicos significativos
6. Which regions saw major impacts from the oil crisis in both short-term and long-term?;Geralmente afetaram os globais
7. The oil crisis was later called...;Primeira crise do petróleo
8. What year did the second oil crisis occur?;1979
9. How much did oil prices rise by March 1974?;Aumentou cerca de 300%
10. Which nations were initially targeted by the oil embargo?;Canadário;Japão;Netherlands;Reino Unido; Estados Unidos

Wait, but question 8 is about the year of the second crisis, and in the context it's called "1979 oil crisis" or "the second oil shock". So perhaps frame it as: What is known as the second oil crisis? Answer would be Segunda crise do petróleo.

But considering the user wants 10 questions, I'll adjust accordingly to fit all into a CSV with concise answers.
