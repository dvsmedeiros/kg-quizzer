Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the provided context about the University of Chicago. Let's start by reading through the context carefully to identify key points.

First, the university is a private research institution in Chicago, Illinois, with its main campus in Hyde Park. That's a good start for a question. Then, it's consistently ranked among the best globally and very selective. I can ask about its ranking or selectivity.

Next, the structure: undergraduate college and five graduate divisions. Maybe a question about its divisions. Then the eight professional schools listed. Each of these could be a question, but I need to pick the most relevant ones. The schools like Law School, Booth School of Business, etc., but maybe a general question about the number of professional schools.

Additional campuses in London, Paris, Beijing, etc. That's a location question. The role of scholars in developing academic disciplines like economics, sociology, etc. Maybe a question about the academic fields they've influenced. The first man-made nuclear reaction in Chicago Pile-1 under Stagg Field. That's a specific historical fact. The radiocarbon revolution in chemistry. Fermi and Argonne National Labs, and the Marine Biological Lab. Also, the University of Chicago Press being the largest in the US. The number of Nobel laureates, Fields Medalists, etc.

I need to ensure each question is unique and covers different aspects. Let me list possible questions:

1. Where is the University of Chicago located? Answer: Chicago, Illinois.
2. What is the main campus neighborhood? Hyde Park.
3. How many professional schools does it have? Eight.
4. Which school is associated with the first nuclear reaction? Metallurgical Lab or Stagg Field? The context says the Metallurgical Lab produced the first reaction under Stagg Field. Maybe a question about that.
5. What is the University of Chicago Press? Largest university press in the US.
6. Number of Nobel laureates? 97.
7. What is the "radiocarbon revolution"? Advances in chemistry leading to carbon-14 dating.
8. Where are the additional campuses located? London, Paris, Beijing, Delhi, Hong Kong.
9. What is the university's role in academic disciplines? Played a major role in developing economics, law, etc.
10. Which national labs does the university administer? Fermi and Argonne.

Now, check for accuracy. The context mentions the Metallurgical Lab produced the first nuclear reaction under Stagg Field. So the question could be about the location of the first nuclear reaction. Also, the answer for the professional schools is eight. The campuses are in those cities. The Nobel laureates are 97. The radiocarbon revolution is from chemistry. The university administers Fermi and Argonne. The press is the largest in the US. The academic disciplines include economics, law, sociology, etc.

Need to make sure the answers are concise, under 10 words. Avoid repeating the same structure. Also, ensure the CSV format with semicolons. Let me draft the pairs now.
