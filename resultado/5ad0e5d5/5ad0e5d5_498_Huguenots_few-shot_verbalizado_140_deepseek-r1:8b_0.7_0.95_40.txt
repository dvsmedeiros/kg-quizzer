Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the given context and facts about the Huguenots. The questions should be relevant and the answers must be correct and concise, derived from the provided information.

First, I'll go through each fact and context to extract potential questions. The context mentions that the Huguenots were concentrated in southern and western France during their peak. That could be a good starting point for a question about their geographical distribution.

Next, looking at the Huguenot leadership, it includes Jeanne d'Albret, her son Henry IV (who later converted to Catholicism), and the princes of Condé. This seems like another solid topic for a question about key figures or leaders.

The French Wars of Religion were fought from 1562 to 1598, which is a significant event related to the Huguenots. I can ask about when these wars took place.

The Edict of Nantes granted them religious, political, and military autonomy. This could be a question about the main outcome or agreement that benefited the Huguenots.

Louis XIV's Edict of Fontainebleau in 1685 revoked Protestant rights, leading to persecution. This could be another key point for a question about later challenges or restrictions on their practices.

The term "Huguenote" might have derived from Bezanson Hugues, a Swiss political leader. That’s a good fact-based question about the origin of the term.

The Scotch-Irish Americans are mentioned as being related to Huguenots, so I can ask how they're connected or if there's an historical link.

Some Huguenots faced dragonnades under Louis XIV, which were forced conversions. This could be a question about specific persecution measures during their decline.

By 1600, Huguenot numbers had dropped to 7-8% from a peak of around 10%. I can ask about the population shift over time.

The remaining Huguenots after the exodus created a brain drain, impacting society. This could be a question about the social impact of their migration.

Lastly, the Edict of Versailles in 1787 ended official persecution, and the Revolution further granted rights. I can ask when these changes occurred and their implications.

Now, I'll structure each of these points into clear questions with concise answers based on the context provided.
