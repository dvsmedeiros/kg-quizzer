Okay, so I need to create a CSV file with 10 question;answer pairs based on the given context about the Black Death. Let me start by reading through the context carefully to identify key points that can be turned into relevant questions.

The context mentions several important aspects: the time period (1346-1353), the causes (bubonic plague, Yersinia pestis, fleas, black rats), transmission methods (person-to-person via aerosols), effects on society and economy, origins in Central or East Asia, the role of Crimea under Jani Beg, spread through Genoese ships and Mediterranean routes, genetic evidence from Kyrgyzstan suggesting an earlier origin, population impact, comparison with the Great Famine, and recurrence until the 19th century.

I should aim for questions that cover these areas. Let me list out potential questions:

1. What time period did the Black Death occur?
2. What caused the Black Death?
3. How was the Black Death transmitted in its early stages?
4. What region did the plague originate from?
5. Who was Jani Beg associated with regarding the spread of the plague?
6. Which animals were involved in spreading the plague via fleas?
7. What economic and social impacts did the Black Death have?
8. What evidence suggests an earlier origin than previously thought?
9. How much did the population decrease due to the Black Death?
10. When was the last major recurrence of the plague?

Now, I need to ensure each question is relevant and the answers are concise, up to 10 words. Let me draft them.

1. What time period did the Black Death occur? Answer: 1346-1353.
2. What caused the Black Death? Answer: Bubonic plague.
3. How was it transmitted early on? Answer: Person-to-person via aerosols.
4. Where did it originate? Answer: Central or East Asia.
5. Who brought it to Crimea? Answer: Jani Beg's army.
6. Which animals spread it via fleas? Answer: Black rats.
7. What were the societal impacts? Answer: Religious, social upheavals.
8. What evidence suggests an early origin? Answer: 2022 Kyrgyzstan deaths.
9. How much population decrease? Answer: 30-60%.
10. When was the last recurrence? Answer: Early 19th century.

I should format each as "pergunta;resposta" and ensure correct Portuguese spelling. Let me double-check each for accuracy based on the context.
