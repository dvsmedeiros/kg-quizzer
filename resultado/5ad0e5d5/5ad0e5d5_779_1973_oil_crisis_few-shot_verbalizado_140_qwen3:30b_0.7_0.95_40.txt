Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs in Portuguese based on the given context about the 1973 oil crisis. Let me start by carefully reading the context and the facts provided.

The context mentions that the 1973 oil crisis began in October 1973 when OAPEC, led by Saudi Arabia, declared an oil embargo targeting countries that supported Israel during the Yom Kippur War. The initial targets were Canada, Japan, the Netherlands, UK, and the US, later expanding to others. The embargo ended in March 1974, with oil prices rising from $3 to $12 per barrel. It's also called the "first oil shock," followed by the 1979 crisis as the "second oil shock."

Now, the facts include various categories and types, like "Embargo," "Crisis," "EconomicPolicy," etc. But the main info is in the abstract. I need to make sure the questions are varied and cover different aspects: dates, reasons, effects, key players, outcomes, etc.

First question: When did the crisis start? Answer: October 1973. That's straightforward.

Second: Who led the embargo? Saudi Arabia.

Third: Which countries were initially targeted? The list includes Canada, Japan, Netherlands, UK, US.

Fourth: When did the embargo end? March 1974.

Fifth: What was the price increase? From $3 to $12 per barrel.

Sixth: What was another name for the crisis? First oil shock.

Seventh: What was the reason for the embargo? Support for Israel during Yom Kippur War.

Eighth: Which countries were later added? Portugal, Rhodesia, South Africa.

Ninth: What was the effect on oil prices? 300% increase.

Tenth: What followed the 1973 crisis? The 1979 crisis, second oil shock.

I need to check that each answer is under 10 words and in Portuguese. Also, ensure no repetition. Let me translate the answers accordingly.

Wait, the example answers have some variations, like "quase US $ 12" for the price. So I should follow that style. Also, check for any specific terms. For instance, "embargo do petróleo" is the correct term. Make sure the questions are in Portuguese, and the answers are concise.

Now, compiling the 10 pairs, ensuring each is unique and covers different aspects. Let me check again the context to avoid missing any key points. The facts mention the types like "Embargo106660520" but the actual info is in the abstract. So stick to the abstract's content.

Final check: 10 pairs, correct format, no markdown, CSV with semicolons. Answers in Portuguese, short, and based on the context.
