Okay, the user wants me to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the provided context about the Black Death. Let me start by understanding the requirements.

First, each pair needs to be a question and a short answer (up to 10 words) in Portuguese. The separator is a semicolon. The output should be just the CSV without any extra text. The example given uses the exact format, so I need to follow that closely.

I'll need to go through the context and pick out key facts. Let me read through the context again to identify important points. The Black Death was a pandemic from 1346-1353, caused by Yersinia pestis, spread by fleas on rats, but also person-to-person. It killed 75-200 million, 30-60% of Europe's population. Origin in Central or East Asia, spread via Crimea, then by ships. The 2022 discovery in Kyrgyzstan suggests earlier spread. It was the second plague pandemic, leading to social and economic changes. Outbreaks continued until the 19th century.

Now, I need to form questions that are relevant. For example, "What caused the Black Death?" The answer would be "Bactéria Yersinia pestis." Another question: "When did the Black Death occur?" Answer: "De 1346 a 1353." I need to make sure the answers are concise. Let me check each answer to ensure they are under 10 words. Also, verify that the questions are clear and the answers are correct based on the context. I'll list out 10 such pairs, making sure there's no repetition and each is distinct. Let me count to ensure there are exactly 10. Once done, format them as per the example, using semicolons and no markdown.
