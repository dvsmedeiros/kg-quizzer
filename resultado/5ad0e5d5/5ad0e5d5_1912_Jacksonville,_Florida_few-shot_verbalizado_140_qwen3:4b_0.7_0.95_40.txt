Okay, I need to generate 10 CSV pairs based on the given context about Jacksonville, Florida. Let me start by reading through the provided text carefully to identify key facts and possible questions.

First, the context mentions that Jacksonville is the most populous city in Florida and the largest by area in the contiguous U.S. as of 2020. That's a good starting point. I can ask a question about its population ranking.

Next, the consolidation with Duval County in 1968 is a key event. So a question about when that happened would be relevant.

The St. Johns River is mentioned as passing through Jacksonville. A question about the river's location there would fit.

The city's nickname "The River City" is noted, so a question about that nickname could be included.

The original inhabitants were the Timucua people, which is a fact from the text. That's another question.

Andrew Jackson, the seventh president, is the city's namesake. That's a direct question.

The Jacksonville Beaches are along the Atlantic coast, so a question about that location makes sense.

The military bases and the Port of Jacksonville are highlighted. A question about the military presence or the port's status would work.

The population in 2020 is given as 949,611, so a question about that number is valid.

The city's weather record in March is 91°F, which is another fact to include.

I need to ensure each question is unique and covers different aspects: population, history, geography, military, culture, etc. Let me check if I have 10 distinct questions and their corresponding answers from the facts provided. Also, I should avoid repeating similar questions and make sure the answers are concise and correct based on the context.
