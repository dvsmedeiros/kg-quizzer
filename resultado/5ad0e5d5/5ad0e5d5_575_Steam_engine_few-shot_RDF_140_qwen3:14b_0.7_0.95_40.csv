I should also pay attention to the namespaces. For example; "ns1" and "ns2" might represent different ontologies. The CSV should include the full predicate URI as the predicate column. 
Another thing to note is that some entries have multiple objects. For instance; the "ns2:wikiPageUsesTemplate" predicate has multiple templates listed. Each of these should be separate rows with the same subject and predicate but different objects.
