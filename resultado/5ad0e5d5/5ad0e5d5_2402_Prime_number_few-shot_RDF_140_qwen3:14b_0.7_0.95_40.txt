Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the provided context and facts. Let me start by understanding the context thoroughly. The context talks about prime numbers, their definition, composite numbers, the fundamental theorem of arithmetic, primality, methods to check primality like trial division, Miller-Rabin, AKS, Mersenne primes, and some historical aspects. The facts provided include various numbers linked to prime factorization and some notable people associated with primes.

First, I should extract key points from the context. For example, the definition of a prime number, the difference between prime and composite numbers, the fundamental theorem of arithmetic, the concept of primality, testing methods, the largest known prime as of December 2018, the prime number theorem, unsolved conjectures like Goldbach and twin primes, and applications in cryptography.

Next, I'll look at the facts. The triples show several numbers (like 101, 103, 107, etc.) with factorization linked to prime numbers. Also, there's mention of Heinrich Scherk and Landon Curt Noll being known for prime numbers. The resource page for Prime_number has various templates and categories.

Now, I need to create questions that cover these topics without repeating. Each question should have a unique answer derived from the context or facts. Let me brainstorm possible questions:

1. Definition of prime numbers.
2. Composite numbers definition.
3. Fundamental theorem of arithmetic.
4. What is primality?
5. Trial division method.
6. Miller-Rabin test.
7. AKS test.
8. Mersenne primes.
9. Largest known prime (as of 2018).
10. Applications in cryptography.

Wait, the example given in the user's message includes questions about the largest known prime as of January 2016. However, the context here says December 2018 with 24,862,048 digits. So I need to adjust that.

Also, the facts mention several numbers linked to primes, so maybe a question about examples of prime numbers. But the example numbers in the facts are all primes, so a question like "Which numbers are examples of prime numbers?" with answers like 101, 103, etc. But the user's example used specific numbers like 5 and 4, so maybe use the numbers from the facts.

Another point is the prime number theorem, which the context mentions. Also, the unsolved conjectures like Goldbach and twin primes. Applications in public-key cryptography.

I need to ensure that each question is distinct and covers different aspects. Let me list them:

1. What defines a prime number? (Answer: natural number greater than 1 not a product of two smaller natural numbers)
2. What is a composite number? (Answer: natural number greater than 1 not prime)
3. What theorem states that every natural number greater than 1 is a prime or product of primes? (Fundamental theorem of arithmetic)
4. What is the property called when a number is prime? (Primality)
5. What method is a simple but slow way to check primality? (Trial division)
6. Which test is fast but has a small error chance? (Miller-Rabin)
7. What test always gives correct answers but is too slow? (AKS)
8. What type of numbers have particularly fast primality tests? (Mersenne numbers)
9. What was the largest known prime as of December 2018? (Mersenne prime with 24,862,048 digits)
10. Where are primes used in information technology? (Public-key cryptography)

Now, I need to check if these answers are in the context. The first question's answer is in the context. Second, same. Third, yes. Fourth, yes. Fifth, yes. Sixth, yes. Seventh, yes. Eighth, yes. Ninth, yes. Tenth, yes.

Also, the facts mention specific numbers like 101, 103, etc., so maybe a question about examples. But the user's example didn't use specific numbers, so maybe it's better to stick with the concepts unless the question is about examples.

Another possible question: What is the significance of the fundamental theorem of arithmetic? (Answer: Every integer greater than 1 can be uniquely represented as a product of primes.)

But I need to ensure no repetition. The user's example had a question about the largest prime as of January 2016, but the context here is December 2018. So that's a good point to include.

Also, the context mentions that primes are used in public-key cryptography, which is a key application.

Now, I need to structure the CSV with the questions and answers. Each line should be: "question","answer".

Let me check for any possible repetition or missing points. I think the list above covers the main points. Now, I'll format them accordingly.
