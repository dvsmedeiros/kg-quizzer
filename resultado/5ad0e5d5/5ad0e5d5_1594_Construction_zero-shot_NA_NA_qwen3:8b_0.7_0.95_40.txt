Okay, the user wants me to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the provided context about the construction industry. Let me start by understanding the context thoroughly. The context explains the definition of construction, its Latin and Old French origins, the processes involved from planning to demolition, its economic contribution, global expenditure figures, and safety statistics.

First, I need to identify key points that can be turned into questions. Let me list out the main topics: definition, etymology, processes involved, economic impact, expenditure figures, safety issues, and maybe some specific statistics like the percentage of GDP or fatality rates.

For each question, the answer should be concise, up to 10 words. Let me make sure each answer is accurate and directly derived from the context. For example, the origin of the term "construction" comes from Latin and Old French. I should phrase that as a question and then the answer.

I also need to check that the questions are clear and not leading. Avoid using technical terms that might be unclear. Let me ensure that each question is unique and covers different aspects of the context. 

Wait, the example given uses "pergunta;resposta" format. I need to make sure the separator is a semicolon. Also, the output should be only the CSV without any additional text. Let me verify that each answer is brief. For instance, "What is the origin of the term 'construction'?" would have the answer "Latin and Old French." 

I should also include questions about the economic contribution, like the percentage of global GDP. The context mentions 13%, so that's a good point. Another question could be about the global expenditure in 2012, which was $4 trillion. 

Safety statistics: 20% of US industry fatalities in 2019 were in construction. That's a key point. Also, the forecast for 2030 expenditure is $14.8 trillion. 

I need to ensure that all 10 questions cover different aspects without repetition. Let me list them out:

1. Origin of "construction"
2. Processes in construction
3. Economic contribution (GDP)
4. Global expenditure 2012
5. Expenditure forecast 2030
6. Safety issue (fatality percentage)
7. Definition of construction
8. Role in economic development
9. Non-monetary benefits
10. Processes from planning to demolition

Wait, some of these might overlap. Let me check for uniqueness. Maybe combine some points. For example, the processes involve planning, design, building, maintenance, etc. The answer should be "planning, design, building, maintenance, and demolition." 

Another point: the construction industry's contribution to GDP is 13%, so a question could be "What percentage of global GDP does construction contribute?" with answer "About 13 percent."

I need to make sure each answer is under 10 words. Let me draft each pair and check the word count. Once that's done, format them into the CSV with semicolons. Also, confirm that the example matches the required format. Alright, I think that's covered. Let me put it all together now.
