Answer: Primes are crucial in mathematics because they are the building blocks of all numbers; every composite number can be factored into primes. This property is fundamental for various mathematical theories and practical applications like cryptography.
Finally, how many primes are there? There's an infinite number of primes; this was proven by Euclid around 300 BC. No finite set of primes can completely list all primes because the sequence is endless.
