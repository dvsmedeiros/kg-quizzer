Alright, I need to generate a quiz based on the provided context about Warsaw. The user has given specific instructions, so let me go through them step by step.

First, the task is to create 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format with Portuguese as the language. Each entry should have a question and a short answer, separated by a semicolon. The output should only be the CSV without any extra text.

Looking at the context, Warsaw is the capital of Poland with a population around 1.86 million. It's situated on the Vistula River. I can start by asking about its location or status as the capital.

The city has two airports: Warsaw Chopin and Warsaw Modlin. That's another good point for questions.

Warsaw was part of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth in the 17th century, so a question about that period makes sense.

It also serves as the headquarters for Frontex and ODIHR, which are EU agencies. I can include that information.

The Warsaw Stock Exchange is significant in Central and Eastern Europe, so that's another point to cover.

The city is known for its reconstructed Old Town, recognized as a World Heritage Site since 1980. That's a key detail.

Warsaw has several universities like the University of Warsaw and Warsaw University of Technology. These can be included as questions about higher education institutions.

Legia Warsaw is a prominent football club there, so that's another topic for a question.

The city's metro system is part of its public transport network, which makes it a good point to mention.

Lastly, the National Philharmonic Orchestra and Zachęta Art Gallery are important cultural institutions in Warsaw.

I should structure each question to be clear and directly related to these key points. Each answer needs to be concise, within 10 words. I'll make sure to vary the topics to cover different aspects of Warsaw—geography, history, economy, culture, education, and infrastructure.

Now, I'll draft each pair, ensuring they follow the correct format and adhere to the instructions provided.
