Wait, the user's context says: "The origin of the Black Death is disputed. The pandemic originated either in Central Asia or East Asia..." So the correct answer should be either Central or East Asia. But in the example, the answer is "as planícies da Ásia Central," which is a bit specific. Maybe that's acceptable if that's a common answer, but the fact says it's disputed. So maybe the answer is "Central ou leste da Ásia." But the example uses "as planícies da Ásia Central," so maybe I should follow that. However, the user's example might not be entirely accurate, but I need to stick to the given facts. Wait, the user provided a list of facts where one of them is "Black Death possui assunto Category:1350s in Asia" and "Black Death está localizado em Eurasia and North Africa." But the origin is disputed. So the answer should reflect that it's either Central or East Asia. But the example answer is "as planícies da Ásia Central," which is a specific place. However, the fact says it's disputed, so maybe the answer is "Central ou leste da Ásia." But I need to check the user's example. The user's example includes "De onde se originou a morte negra?;as planícies da Ásia Central," which is a specific answer, but according to the fact, the origin is disputed. So perhaps that's acceptable if the answer is commonly accepted as Central Asia. Alternatively, maybe the answer is "Central ou leste da Ásia." But the user's example uses Central Asia. I need to be careful here. Since the user's example uses that, maybe that's acceptable. But the fact says it's disputed. Hmm, maybe the answer should be "Central ou leste da Ásia." But I need to make sure that the answer is based on the given facts. The user's facts mention "The pandemic originated either in Central Asia or East Asia..." so the answer should be either. But the example answer is "as planícies da Ásia Central," so maybe that's acceptable. Alternatively, the answer could be "Central ou leste da Ásia." But the user's example uses "as planícies da Ásia Central," so maybe that's acceptable. I'll proceed with that.
Next, the spread via Genoese ships. The example has "Como a morte negra chegou ao Mediterrâneo e à Europa?;navios mercantes." Which is correct. The context says that from Crimea, it was carried by fleas on Genoese ships.
Another question could be about the population affected. The example has "Quanto da população europeia matou a morte negra?;30 a 60% da população total da Europa." Which is correct based on the context.
Another question could be about the time it took to recover. The example says "Quando a população mundial finalmente se recuperou da morte negra?;século XVII." Which is in line with the context.
Another question is about the different forms of the plague. The context mentions bubonic, pneumonic, and septicemic. But the example doesn't have that. However, the user's facts mention "Black Death é do tipo Outbreak107435273," but that's not directly relevant. Maybe a question about the different forms. For example, "Quais são as formas de disseminação da morte negra?;bubônica, pneumônica e septicêmica." But the user's example doesn't include that.
Another point is the discovery of a surge in Kyrgyzstan. The context says "April 2020" in the facts, but that's a date. Wait, the fact says "Black Death possui data April 2020," which seems incorrect. Wait, the user's facts have "Black Death possui data April 2020" which is likely a mistake, but maybe it's a note. However, the actual origin is in the 14th century, so that's conflicting. Maybe that's a typo. But the user's facts might have some errors, but I need to follow them. However, the user's example has "Quando a população mundial finalmente se recuperou da morte negra?;século XVII," which is correct, as the plague lasted until the 14th century, and recovery took until the 17th century.
But need to check if these questions are based on the facts. The user's facts mention the origin in Central or East Asia, spread via Genoese ships, population affected, recovery time, duration, forms of the plague, the primary vector (fleas), effects, cause (Yersinia pestis), and the date of the discovery in Kyrgyzstan (but that's conflicting with the actual date). However, the user's facts have "Black Death possui data April 2020," which seems incorrect, but maybe it's a mistake. However, the user's example has "Quando a população mundial finalmente se recuperou da morte negra?;século XVII," which is correct.
