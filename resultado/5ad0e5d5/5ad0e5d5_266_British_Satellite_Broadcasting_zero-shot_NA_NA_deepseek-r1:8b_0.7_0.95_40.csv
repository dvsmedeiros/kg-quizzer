Okay; so I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs based on the given context about BSB and its merger with Sky Television. Let me start by reading through the context carefully.
For each question; I need a relevant one and a short correct answer. Let me brainstorm some questions:
   - November 2; 1990
Wait; some of these might overlap or be too similar. I should check for uniqueness and make sure each question is distinct.
3. What date was the merger? Answer: November 2; 1990
9. After merger; what entity was formed? BSB and Sky formed BSkyB?
Wait; maybe I should adjust some to ensure accuracy.
