Okay, the user wants me to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the provided context about private schools. Let me start by understanding the context thoroughly.

The context explains that private schools are not government-funded, unlike public schools. They are independent, have their own governance, and may have a board of governors. I need to create questions that test understanding of these key points.

First, I'll identify the main concepts: definition of private schools, funding source, governance structure, comparison with public schools, and their independence. Each question should target one of these aspects.

I need to ensure the answers are concise, up to 10 words. Let me brainstorm possible questions. For example, "What is a private school?" The answer would be "A school not funded by the government." That's within the word limit.

Another point is the governance structure. A question could be, "What governs private schools?" The answer would be "A board of governors." That's short and accurate.

I should also include comparisons. Like, "How do private schools differ from public schools?" Answer: "They are not government-funded." That's a direct comparison.

I need to make sure each question is unique and covers different aspects. Let me list out possible questions and their answers, checking for clarity and brevity. Also, avoid repetition in the questions. Once I have 10 pairs, I'll format them into CSV with semicolons as separators. Let me double-check each answer to ensure they are correct and concise. Alright, that should cover it.
