First, the task is to create 10 pairs of question and answer in CSV format. Each pair should be "pergunta;(resposta)". The context is theoretical computer science, focusing on computational complexity theory, P vs NP problem, etc.
8. What about bipartite matching being solvable in O(n^3) time? That doesn't seem right; I think it's O(n).
