Okay, so I'm trying to create a quiz based on this passage about the Rhine River. The user wants 10 question-answer pairs in Portuguese, each with a semicolon separator. Let me read through the context again to make sure I understand all the key points.

The Rhine starts in Switzerland's Graubünden canton, flows through several countries including Liechtenstein, Austria, Germany, and France, before ending in the Netherlands where it meets the North Sea. It has a drainage area of 9,973 square kilometers and its name comes from Celtic Rēnos. There are two German states named after it: North Rhine-Westphalia and Rhineland-Palatinate. The river is about 1,230 km long, making it the second-longest in Central and Western Europe after the Danube. It's an important navigable waterway with significant cities like Cologne, Rotterdam, Düsseldorf, etc., along its path.

Now, I need to formulate questions that cover these points without being too straightforward. Let me start drafting some questions:

1. Where does the Rhine River originate? – This is direct but essential.
2. Which countries does it form borders with? Maybe asking specifically about Switzerland and Liechtenstein first since those are early in the context.
3. What's the name origin of the Rhine? That's a good detail.
4. The discharge rate: 2,900 m³/s is mentioned, so that can be a question.
5. Which German states are named after it? Important for geography.
6. The two longest rivers in Europe – I should make sure to include Danube as the longer one.
7. How long is the Rhine? Basic fact but necessary.
8. What's the significance of castles along the river? It’s about historical trade routes.
9. Which city in France is on the Rhine? Strasbourg is mentioned.
10. The flow direction near its end – westerly into the Netherlands.

I should make sure each answer is concise, within 10 words, and in Portuguese. Also, check if any questions might overlap or be redundant. I think these cover all major points without repetition.
