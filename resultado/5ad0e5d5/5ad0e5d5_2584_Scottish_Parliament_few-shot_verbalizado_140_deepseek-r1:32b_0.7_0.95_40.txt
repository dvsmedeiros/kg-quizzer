Okay, so I need to generate a quiz with 10 questions based on the given context about the Scottish Parliament. Let me start by reading through the abstract and facts provided to understand the key points.

The abstract mentions that the Scottish Parliament is a devolved legislature established after the 1997 referendum, with the Scotland Act 1998 detailing its powers. It's unicameral, located in Edinburgh, has 129 MSPs elected every five years through an additional member system. The most recent election was on May 6, 2021, where the SNP won a plurality.

Looking at the facts, there are various constituencies and regions mentioned, different political parties with their seat counts, committees, leaders like George Adam, Alison Johnstone, and others. Also, notable bills like the UK Withdrawal from the European Union (Legal Continuity) (Scotland) Bill 2018.

Now, I need to create varied questions covering these aspects without repeating similar ones. Each question should have a single correct answer that's either directly stated or can be inferred from the context.

Let me think of possible questions:

1. When was the Scottish Parliament established? Probably in 1999 as per the abstract.
2. How many MSPs are there? 129.
3. What election method is used? Additional member system.
4. Which party won the last election? SNP with a plurality.
5. What does the Scotland Act 1998 specify? Reserved powers.
6. How often are MSPs elected? Every five years.
7. Who was the Presiding Officer in 2021? Alison Johnstone.
8. What's the legislative competence of the Scottish Parliament? All areas not reserved to Westminster.
9. When did the first meeting occur after re-establishment? May 12, 1999.
10. Which bill is related to Brexit legal continuity? The one mentioned in 2018.

Wait, but I need to ensure each question is unique and covers different aspects. Let me check if these cover various areas: establishment, structure, election details, political parties, key legislation, competencies, etc.

I think this covers a good range without repetition. Each answer should be concise, within 10 words.
