Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the provided context about Islamism. Let me start by understanding the context thoroughly.

The context explains that Islamism is a political ideology aiming to reconstitute states according to Islamic principles. It mentions different strategies like revolutionary or reformist approaches, the role of Sharia, pan-Islamic unity, and key figures like Rached Ghannouchi, Sayyid Qutb, and others. It also discusses the Arab Spring's impact and the diversity within Islamist movements, including both peaceful and extremist factions.

Now, I need to create 10 relevant questions. Each question should be concise and directly related to the context. The answers must be short, up to 10 words. Let me brainstorm possible questions:

1. What is the main goal of Islamism? (Answer: Reconstitute states according to Islamic principles.)
2. What are the two main strategies of Islamism? (Answer: Revolutionary or reformist approaches.)
3. What does Islamism advocate regarding Sharia? (Answer: Implementation of Sharia.)
4. What term do some Islamists prefer over "Islamism"? (Answer: Islamic activism.)
5. Who are some key figures in 20th-century Islamism? (Answer: Sayyid Qutb, Hassan al-Banna, etc.)
6. How did Islamist movements affect the Middle East? (Answer: Altered the Middle East significantly.)
7. What did Qutb's followers become known as? (Answer: Islamic extremists.)
8. What is the term for the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant? (Answer: ISIL.)
9. What does the term "Islamism" not specify in academic use? (Answer: Vision of Islamic order.)
10. What did Robin Wright note about Islamist movements? (Answer: Altered the Middle East more than any trend.)

Wait, some answers might need to be shorter. Let me check the word count. For example, the answer to question 5 could be "Sayyid Qutb, Hassan al-Banna, etc." which is under 10 words. The answer to question 7: "Islamic extremists" is good. The answer to question 9: "Vision of Islamic order" is concise. I think these are all within the limit. Now, I'll format them as CSV with semicolons. Make sure each line is pergunta;resposta. Let me double-check the context to ensure accuracy. All answers are based on the provided text. Alright, that should do it.
