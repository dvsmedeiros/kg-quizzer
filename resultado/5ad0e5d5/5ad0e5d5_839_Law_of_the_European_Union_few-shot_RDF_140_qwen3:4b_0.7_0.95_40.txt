Okay, the user wants me to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the provided context. Let me start by understanding the context thoroughly.

The context is about European Union law, mentioning its origin, purpose, and the role of the Court of Justice of the European Union. There are also some facts in RDF format, but I need to focus on the main points from the abstract.

First, I should identify key elements from the abstract: the system of supranational laws, the member states, the founding of the European Coal and Steel Community, the goals like peace, social justice, economic policies, environmental protection, the Treaties of the EU, and the Court of Justice.

Now, I need to create varied and comprehensive questions. Each question should have a unique answer, and the answers must be directly inferable from the context. Let me brainstorm possible questions.

1. What is the main purpose of EU law? (Promote peace, social justice, etc.)
2. How many member states does the EU have? (27)
3. When was the European Coal and Steel Community founded? (1952)
4. What is the role of the Court of Justice of the European Union? (Interpret EU law)
5. What are the constitutional structures of the EU? (Treaties of the EU)
6. What are the goals of EU law? (Peace, social justice, etc.)
7. What is the main source of EU law? (Treaties)
8. What is the role of the judicial branch in EU law? (Interpret and create case law)
9. What is the focus of the Common Market Law Review? (Law of the European Union)
10. What is the primary topic of the Law of the European Union page? (EU law)

I need to make sure each question is distinct and the answers are concise. Also, avoid repeating similar questions. Let me check the examples given in the context to ensure the answers are accurate. For instance, the answer to the question about the Court of Justice should be "interpret and create case law." The answer about the member states is 27. The answer about the founding is 1952. 

I should also check if the questions are in Portuguese as per the instructions. The examples given by the user are in Portuguese, so I need to phrase the questions in Portuguese. Wait, the user said the questions should be in Portuguese. Let me confirm that. The user's example shows "pergunta;resposta" in Portuguese. So the questions and answers need to be in Portuguese.

Let me adjust the questions to Portuguese. For example, "Qual é o principal objetivo da lei europeia?" becomes "Qual é o principal objetivo da lei europeia?" with the answer "promover paz, justiça social, economia e proteção ambiental."

I need to make sure each answer is under 10 words. Let me check each one. Also, ensure that the answers are derived directly from the context. For example, the answer about the Court of Justice is "interpreta e cria decisões jurisprudenciais" which is under 10 words.

Now, compiling all 10 questions and answers in the correct CSV format. Each line should be "pergunta;resposta" with a semicolon. No extra text, just the CSV lines. Let me verify that all answers are correctly inferred from the context and that the questions are varied and cover different aspects of the EU law.
