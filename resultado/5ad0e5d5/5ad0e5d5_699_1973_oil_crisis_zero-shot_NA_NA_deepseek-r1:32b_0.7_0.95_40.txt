Okay, I need to create a quiz based on the given context about the 1973 oil crisis. The user has provided specific instructions for generating 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format with Portuguese language and semicolon separators.

First, I'll read through the context carefully to identify key points. The main elements are:

- The event is called the first oil crisis or 1973 oil crisis.
- It started in October 1973.
- Organized by OAPEC, led by Saudi Arabia.
- Targeted countries that supported Israel during the Yom Kippur War: Canada, Japan, Netherlands, UK, USA. Later included Portugal, Rhodesia, South Africa.
- The embargo ended in March 1974.
- Oil price increased nearly 300%, from $3 to almost $12 per barrel globally; higher in the US.
- It's referred to as the first oil shock, followed by the 1979 crisis as the second.

Now, I'll think of questions that cover these points. Each question should be clear and have a short answer (up to 10 words). They should test understanding of dates, key players, affected countries, economic impact, and terminology.

I need to ensure variety in the questions: some about causes, effects, specifics like months or prices. Also, include terms like "oil shock" and mention the subsequent crisis for context.

Let me draft each pair step by step:

1. When did the 1973 oil crisis start?
   - October 1973

2. What was the primary reason behind it?
   - Support for Israel in Yom Kippur War

3. Which organization led the embargo?
   - OAPEC (Organização dos Países Exportadores de Petróleo Arabes)

4. Main leader of OAPEC during this time.
   - Saudi Arabia

5. What was the main goal? Targeted countries' support for Israel.

6. How long did the embargo last? October 1973 to March 1974.

7. Impact on oil prices: increase from $3 to $12 per barrel globally.

8. US prices were higher than global average.

9. What was this event called in economic terms?
   - First oil shock

10. Follow-up crisis in 1979 is known as the second oil shock.

I'll structure each into a question and answer, ensuring Portuguese accuracy and brevity.
