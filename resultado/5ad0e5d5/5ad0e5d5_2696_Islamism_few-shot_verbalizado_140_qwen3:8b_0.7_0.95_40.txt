Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the provided context and facts. Let me start by understanding the context. The context explains that Islamism is a political ideology aiming to reconstitute states according to Islamic principles, with both revolutionary and reformist strategies. It mentions key figures like Hassan al-Banna and Sayyid Qutb, and various groups associated with Islamism.

Looking at the facts, there are many entries listing different organizations and parties with Islamism as their ideology, along with some metadata like dates, templates, and images. I should use these to form questions. The user wants varied and comprehensive questions, so I need to avoid repetition and cover different aspects.

First, I'll identify key points from the context: definition, strategies (revolutionary vs. reformist), goals (sharia, pan-Islamic unity), key figures, and examples of groups. Then, I'll check the facts for specific organizations mentioned, like Tehreek-e-Jafaria, Muslim Brotherhood, etc. 

For each question, I need a short answer, up to 10 words. Let me brainstorm possible questions. For example, "What is the main goal of Islamism?" Answer: Reconstitute states according to Islamic principles. Another could be about key figures: "Who is a prominent figure in 20th-century Islamism?" Answer: Hassan al-Banna.

I should also include questions about the strategies, like "What are the two main strategies of Islamism?" Answer: Revolutionary and reformist. Then, mention specific groups like the Muslim Brotherhood or Hamas. Also, note the term's usage in different contexts, like the distinction between Islamism and Islamic activism.

I need to ensure answers are directly from the context or facts. For instance, the term's popularity among Islamists, the debate around it, and examples of groups. I should avoid repeating the same type of questions. Let me list 10 unique ones, checking for variety and correctness. Finally, format them as CSV with semicolons.
