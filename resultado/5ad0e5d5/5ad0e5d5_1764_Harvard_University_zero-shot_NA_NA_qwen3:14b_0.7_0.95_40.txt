Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the provided context about Harvard University. Let me start by reading through the context carefully to identify key points.

First, the context mentions Harvard's founding in 1636 as Harvard College, named after John Harvard. That's a good point for a question about the founding year or the founder. Also, it's the oldest institution in the US. Maybe a question about its status as the oldest.

Next, the university's location in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and its campuses. There are three main campuses: Cambridge, Allston, and Longwood. A question about the campuses could be useful.

The endowment is $50.9 billion, which is the largest in the world. That's a key fact. Also, the endowment per student is fifth in the US. Maybe a question on that.

Harvard Library is the largest academic library system with 79 libraries and 20.4 million items. That's another point.

The founding was authorized by the Massachusetts colonial legislature, and early focus on training Congregational clergy. But later secularized. A question about its early focus.

President Charles William Eliot's tenure from 1869-1909, and the development of professional schools. That's a key period in its history.

Harvard's alumni include eight U.S. presidents and 188 billionaires. That's a significant statistic.

The Association of American Universities was co-founded in 1900. Another historical point.

Harvard's ranking among the most prestigious and highly ranked universities globally. A question on its reputation.

Turing Award laureates: 14 affiliated with Harvard. That's a notable fact.

Now, I need to form questions and concise answers. Let me check for each key point and ensure the answers are under 10 words. Avoid repetition and cover different aspects of the context. Also, make sure the CSV is correctly formatted with semicolons.
