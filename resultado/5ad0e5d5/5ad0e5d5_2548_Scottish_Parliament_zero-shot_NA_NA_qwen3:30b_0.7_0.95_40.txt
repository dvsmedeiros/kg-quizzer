Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs based on the given context about the Scottish Parliament. Let me start by reading through the context carefully to understand the key points.

First, the Scottish Parliament is the devolved legislature of Scotland, located in Edinburgh. It has 129 MSPs, elected using the additional member system. There are 73 constituencies and 56 list members from 8 regions. The first meeting was in 1999, and there's mention of the Scotland Act 1998, 2012, 2016, and the UK Internal Market Act 2020. Also, the Parliament's powers are defined by what's not reserved to the UK Parliament.

Now, I need to come up with questions that test understanding of these facts. Let me list possible topics:

1. Number of MSPs
2. Election system (additional member system)
3. Location
4. Historical context (original Parliament of Scotland)
5. Key acts (Scotland Act 1998, 2012, 2016)
6. Powers of the Parliament
7. Effect of the UK Internal Market Act 2020
8. First meeting date
9. Composition of MSPs (constituencies vs. list members)
10. Reserved powers

I need to make sure each question is clear and the answer is concise, under 10 words. Let me draft each pair:

1. How many members does the Scottish Parliament have? - 129 members (MSPs)
2. What system is used for electing MSPs? - Additional member system
3. Where is the Scottish Parliament located? - Edinburgh (Holyrood area)
4. When was the original Parliament of Scotland dissolved? - 1707 (Acts of Union)
5. What act defined the Parliament's legislative powers? - Scotland Act 1998
6. What does the Scotland Act 2012 expand? - Taxation and welfare powers
7. What restricts the Parliament's regulatory autonomy? - UK Internal Market Act 2020
8. When did the new Parliament first meet? - 12 May 1999
9. How many constituencies elect MSPs? - 73
10. What are powers not reserved to the UK called? - Devolved powers

I need to check the answers are accurate. For example, the first meeting was in 1999, the UK Internal Market Act 2020 is the one that restricts, and the Scotland Act 2012 expanded taxation and welfare. Also, the original Parliament dissolved in 1707. The answers should be short. Let me adjust any that are too long. For example, "129 members (MSPs)" is 4 words, which is okay. "Additional member system" is 3 words. "Edinburgh (Holyrood area)" is 4. "1707 (Acts of Union)" is 3. "Scotland Act 1998" is 3. "Taxation and welfare powers" is 4. "UK Internal Market Act 2020" is 5. "12 May 1999" is 3. "73" is 1. "Devolved powers" is 2. All under 10 words. Looks good. Now format as CSV.
