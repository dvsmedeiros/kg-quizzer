Okay, the user wants me to generate 10 question-answer pairs in Portuguese based on the provided context about packet switching. Let me start by understanding the context thoroughly.

First, the context explains packet switching in telecommunications, mentioning key points like packets having headers and payloads, the role of headers in directing data, the originators like Paul Baran and Donald Davies, and the impact on networks like ARPANET. 

I need to create questions that cover these main points. The answers should be concise, under 10 words. Let me brainstorm possible questions:

1. Who developed the concept of packet switching? Answer: Paul Baran.
2. What is the main component of a packet? Answer: Header and payload.
3. What is the purpose of the header? Answer: Direct the packet to its destination.
4. Who coined the term "packet switching"? Answer: Donald Davies.
5. What was the goal of Paul Baran's research? Answer: Fault-tolerant, efficient routing.
6. What did packet switching replace? Answer: Pre-allocation of network bandwidth.
7. Which network incorporated packet switching? Answer: ARPANET.
8. What is the primary basis for data communications? Answer: Packet switching.
9. What did Paul Baran's work contradict? Answer: Pre-allocation of network bandwidth.
10. What did Donald Davies inspire? Answer: Numerous packet switching networks.

Now, check if each answer is under 10 words. Some might need trimming. For example, "Fault-tolerant, efficient routing method" is 5 words. "Direct the packet to its destination" is 6. "Incorporated into the design of the ARPANET" is 7. Adjust as needed. Ensure the questions are clear and directly related to the context. Avoid any markdown, just plain CSV. Make sure the separator is semicolon. Let me verify each pair again for accuracy and conciseness.
