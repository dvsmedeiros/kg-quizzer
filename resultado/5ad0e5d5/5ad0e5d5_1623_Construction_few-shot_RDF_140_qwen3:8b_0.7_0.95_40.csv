Here; the URI is <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Construction>.
Another thing to watch out for is that some lines might have multiple predicates for the same URI. For instance; a line might have:
I need to make sure that all such entries are processed correctly; handling the special cases for "ns1:barWidth" and "ns1:data".
