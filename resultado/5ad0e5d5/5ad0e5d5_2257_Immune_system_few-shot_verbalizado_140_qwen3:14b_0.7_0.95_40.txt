Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the provided context and facts. Let me start by carefully reading the context and the facts to understand the key points.

The context explains that the immune system protects organisms from diseases by detecting pathogens, cancer cells, etc. It mentions the two main subsystems: innate and adaptive immunity. The innate system provides preconfigured responses, while the adaptive system learns from previous encounters. It also talks about immunodeficiency, autoimmunity, and the role of various cells and mechanisms like phagocytosis, defensins, and the complement system.

Looking at the facts, there are many components of the immune system listed, such as T cells, B cells, macrophages, neutrophils, etc. There are also mentions of diseases related to immune dysfunction, like autoimmune diseases and immunodeficiency (e.g., HIV/AIDS, SCID). Additionally, some models, categories, and other information related to the immune system are noted in the facts.

Now, I need to create varied questions that cover these aspects. The questions should be based on the context and the facts, and answers must be concise (up to 10 words) and derived from the given information.

Possible topics for questions:
- Definition of the immune system.
- Subsystems of the immune system (innate vs. adaptive).
- Functions of the immune system (detecting pathogens, etc.).
- Cells involved in the immune system (T cells, B cells, macrophages, etc.).
- Diseases related to immune dysfunction (autoimmune diseases, immunodeficiency).
- Components of the immune system (phagocytosis, defensins, complement system).
- Mechanisms of adaptive immunity (immunological memory, vaccination).
- Specific examples of immune-related diseases (HIV/AIDS, rheumatoid arthritis).
- The role of specific cells or mechanisms in the immune response.
- Differences between innate and adaptive immunity.

I need to ensure that each question is unique and covers different aspects. Let me start drafting the questions and answers:

1. What is the primary function of the immune system? → protege organismos contra doenças.
2. What are the two main subsystems of the immune system? → imunidade inata e adaptativa.
3. Which cells are involved in adaptive immunity? → T cells e B cells.
4. What is the result of an overactive immune system attacking the body's own tissues? → autoimunidade.
5. What is the term for a weakened immune system leading to recurrent infections? → imunodeficiência.
6. What is the process by which the immune system remembers past infections? → memória imunológica.
7. Which immune system component detects and destroys cancer cells? → sistema imunológico adaptativo.
8. What is the role of phagocytosis in the immune system? → engolir e destruir patógenos.
9. What is the cause of rheumatoid arthritis? → autoimunidade.
10. What is the name of the system that includes T cells and B cells? → sistema imunológico adaptativo.

Wait, some answers might be too similar or not directly from the context. Let me check again. The context mentions "adaptive (or acquired) immunity creates an immunological memory leading to an enhanced response to subsequent encounters with that same pathogen. This process of acquired immunity is the basis of vaccination." So "memória imunológica" is correct. Also, the context states that dysfunction can cause autoimmune diseases, so "autoimunidade" is correct. 

I should ensure that each answer is directly supported by the context or facts. Also, check for repetition. For example, if I have two questions about adaptive immunity, they should be different aspects. Let me adjust the list:

1. What is the primary function of the immune system? → protege organismos contra doenças.
2. What are the two main subsystems of the immune system? → imunidade inata e adaptativa.
3. Which cells are involved in adaptive immunity? → T cells e B cells.
4. What is the result of an overactive immune system attacking the body's own tissues? → autoimunidade.
5. What is the term for a weakened immune system leading to recurrent infections? → imunodeficiência.
6. What is the process by which the immune system remembers past infections? → memória imunológica.
7. Which immune system component detects and destroys cancer cells? → sistema imunológico adaptativo.
8. What is the role of phagocytosis in the immune system? → engolir e destruir patógenos.
9. What is the cause of rheumatoid arthritis? → autoimunidade.
10. What is the name of the system that includes T cells and B cells? → sistema imunológico adaptativo.

Hmm, questions 3 and 10 might be similar. Let me rephrase 10 to be about the components of the adaptive immune system. Alternatively, question 10 could be about the function of B cells. Let me check the facts again. The facts mention T cell, B cell, macrophage, neutrophil, etc. So maybe another question could be about the role of B cells. But the user wants 10 questions, so I need to ensure all are valid and not repeating.

Alternatively, question 10 could be about the complement system. The context mentions the complement system as one of the mechanisms. So:

10. What is the complement system's role in the immune response? → auxilia na destruição de patógenos.

Yes, that's a good addition. Now, the list is more varied. Let me verify each answer against the context and facts to ensure accuracy.
