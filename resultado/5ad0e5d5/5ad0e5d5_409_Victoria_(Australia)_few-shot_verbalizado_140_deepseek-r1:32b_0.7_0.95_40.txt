Okay, so I need to help generate a quiz based on the given context and facts about Victoria in Australia. Let me start by understanding what's needed here.

First, the user wants 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format, with each line containing a question and its corresponding answer separated by a semicolon. The questions should be relevant to the provided content, which includes an abstract, triples, and some example few-shot questions. Each answer must be concise (up to 10 words) and in Portuguese.

Looking at the context, Victoria is described as a state in southeastern Australia with specific geographical features, population statistics, economic details, cultural aspects, and historical information. The facts section lists various people, places, events, and organizations associated with Victoria.

To create varied and comprehensive questions, I should cover different aspects of the context: geography, economy, culture, history, notable individuals, etc. Each question must have a single correct answer that's either directly stated or can be inferred from the provided information.

Let me go through the context and facts to identify key points that can form the basis of good quiz questions.

10. **Cultural Institutions**: Melbourne has museums and art galleries, and is the spiritual home of Australian cricket and football.
    - Question: Que cidade é considerada o lar espiritual do críquete australiano?

Wait, but I need to ensure that each answer is directly supported by the context or facts. Let me cross-check each point.

1. Geography: Yes, Victoria is bordered by NSW and SA.
2. Population density: Correct.
3. Gold Rush impact: Mentioned in the context.
4. Sporting capital: Explicitly stated about Melbourne.
5. Government seats: From the context.

Checking for any possible overlaps or repetitions. Each question addresses a unique aspect based on the context and facts provided.
