Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the provided context about the immune system. Let me start by understanding the context and the facts given. The context explains that the immune system protects against diseases by detecting pathogens and distinguishing them from the body's own cells. It mentions two subsystems: innate and adaptive. The facts include various entities related to the immune system, like B cells, T cells, macrophages, etc., and some related to immunology, autoimmunity, and diseases.

First, I should ensure that each question is unique and covers different aspects of the immune system. The questions need to be varied, so I'll focus on different parts like components, functions, diseases, and subsystems. Let me list possible topics: components (like cells and organs), functions (detection, response), diseases (autoimmune, immunodeficiency), subsystems (innate vs. adaptive), and related terms (immunological memory, vaccination).

Now, I'll check the example provided to see the structure. Each line has a question and a short answer, separated by a semicolon. The answers should be concise, up to 10 words. I need to avoid repeating similar questions and ensure answers are directly from the context or facts.

Starting with the first question: "What does the immune system protect against?" The answer is "diseases" as stated in the context. Next, maybe ask about the agents detected, which are pathogens. Then, the two subsystems: innate and adaptive. The context also mentions immunological memory as part of adaptive immunity. Autoimmune diseases and immunodeficiency are covered in the context. The example includes questions about the system protecting the brain, which is the neuroimmune system. Also, the difference between innate and adaptive, and the term for hyperactive immune system (autoimmunity).

I should also include terms from the facts, like B cells, T cells, and macrophages. However, the user might prefer more general questions rather than specific cell types unless they are key points. The example includes "What are the two types of imunidade?" which translates to "imunidade humoral versus imunidade mediada por células." Wait, in the example provided, the answer is "imunidade humoral versus imunidade mediada por células." So I should use similar phrasing.

Let me list possible questions and answers:

1. What does the immune system protect against?;diseases.
2. What are the agents detected by the immune system?;pathogens.
3. What are the two main subsystems of the immune system?;innate and adaptive.
4. What is the term for immunological memory?;enhanced response to pathogens.
5. What causes autoimmune diseases?;hyperactive immune system attacking tissues.
6. What is immunodeficiency?;immune system less active than normal.
7. What is the system that protects the brain?;neuroimmune system.
8. What are the two types of immunity?;humoral and cell-mediated.
9. What is the basis of vaccination?;acquired immunity.
10. What is the term for the immune system attacking normal tissues?;autoimmunity.

Wait, some answers might need to be shorter. For example, "enhanced response to pathogens" could be "immunological memory." Let me check the context again. The context says "Adaptive (or acquired) immunity creates an immunological memory leading to an enhanced response to subsequent encounters with that same pathogen." So the term is "immunological memory," which is the answer to the question "What is the term for immunological memory?" But maybe the question should be more direct. Alternatively, "What is the basis of vaccination?" Answer: acquired immunity.

Also, the example includes a question about the two types of immunity, which is "imunidade humoral versus imunidade mediada por células." So in Portuguese, that's "imunidade humoral versus imunidade mediada por células."

I need to make sure all answers are concise and directly from the context. Let me verify each question against the context and facts to ensure accuracy. Also, avoid repeating similar questions. For example, the example has a question about the system protecting the brain, which is the neuroimmune system. Another question could be about the function of the immune system, which is protecting against diseases.

Now, compiling the 10 questions and answers, ensuring they are unique and answers are correct. Let me structure them in CSV format as specified.
