Alright, I need to generate 10 pairs of questions and answers in CSV format based on the provided context and facts. Let me start by carefully reading the instructions and examples to understand what's expected.

First, the user wants the output in Portuguese, with semicolons as separators. Each line should be "pergunta;resposta", and the answers should be concise, up to 10 words. The questions must be relevant, varied, and based on the given context, facts, or examples.

Looking at the context, the main topic is the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change). The facts provided include various triples, some of which might be useful. For example, the IPCC was established by the WMO and UNEP in 1988, it's part of the UN, has 195 member states, and has a secretariat in Geneva. The facts also mention specific people like Hoesung Lee as the current president, Rajendra Pachauri who resigned in 2015, and Bert Bolin as the first president. There are details about the assessment cycles, reports, Nobel Prize, and special reports.

I need to ensure the questions are varied. Let me list possible topics:
1. Establishment of IPCC (when, by whom)
2. Member states
3. Leadership (current and past presidents)
4. Structure (working groups, secretariat location)
5. Reports and their significance
6. Nobel Prize
7. Assessment cycles
8. Special reports
9. Role in UNFCCC negotiations
10. Function and methodology

Now, I'll start creating questions based on these points, making sure each answer is derived from the context or facts. I'll avoid repeating similar questions. For example, if I ask about the establishment, I can't ask the same for member states. Let me check the example given to match the style.

For instance, "De que organização o IPCC faz parte?;as Nações Unidas," is a question about the parent organization. Another example is about the president's nationality. So, similar patterns can be followed.

I need to cross-reference the facts provided. For example, the fact "Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change tem sede principal em Geneva" can be a question: "Onde está localizada a sede principal do IPCC?;Geneva, Switzerland,".

Also, the facts mention "Rajendra K. Pachauri possui ocupação Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change" and "Quando Pachauri renunciou ao cargo de presidente do IPCC?;fevereiro de 2015," from the example. So, I can use that.

Now, I'll list 10 questions and answers, ensuring they are diverse and based on the provided information. Let me verify each answer against the context or facts to ensure accuracy.
