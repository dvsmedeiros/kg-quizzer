Okay, so I need to generate 10 quiz questions and answers based on the given context about prime numbers. Let me start by reading through the context carefully.

The context explains what prime numbers are—natural numbers greater than 1 that aren't products of smaller natural numbers. It mentions composite numbers as their counterparts. There's a lot about primality, methods to check for primes like trial division, Miller-Rabin test, and AKS test. Also, it talks about the distribution of primes, their use in cryptography, and some historical conjectures.

Looking at the example provided, I see that each question is related to different aspects of prime numbers, such as definitions, properties, tests, and applications. I should aim for similar variety.

I'll need to create questions that touch on various points: what a prime number is, examples, composite vs prime, the fundamental theorem of arithmetic, methods to test primality (like Miller-Rabin and AKS), the largest known primes, historical aspects, etc.

Let me list possible topics:

1. Definition of prime numbers.
2. Difference between prime and composite numbers.
3. Fundamental theorem of arithmetic.
4. Primality testing methods.
5. The role of primes in number theory.
6. Examples of prime numbers.
7. The largest known prime.
8. Applications like cryptography.
9. Historical conjectures (though maybe too detailed for a short answer).
10. Properties related to distribution.

Now, I'll think of specific questions:

- What defines a prime number?
- How are composite numbers different from primes?
- Name the theorem about unique factorization.
- What's the simplest method to check if a number is prime?
- What are two efficient primality tests?
- When was the largest known prime found?
- How many digits does the largest known prime have as of 2018?
- What conjecture says every even number >2 is sum of two primes?
- Who demonstrated there are infinitely many primes?
- What's a use of prime numbers in technology?

I need to ensure each question has one correct answer and that I don't repeat similar questions. Also, the answers should be concise.

Let me draft these:

1. What defines a prime number? Answer: Um número natural maior que 1 que não é produto de dois números menores.
2. How are composite numbers different from primes? Answer: São produtos de dois ou mais números naturais menores que ele mesmo.
3. Name the theorem about unique factorization. Answer: Teorema fundamental da aritmética.
4. What's the simplest method to check if a number is prime? Answer: Divisão trial.
5. What are two efficient primality tests? Answer: Miller-Rabin e AKS.
6. When was the largest known prime found? Answer: Janeiro de 2016.
7. How many digits does it have? Answer: 24,862,048 dígitos decimais.
8. What conjecture about primes is still unsolved? Answer: Conjectura de Goldbach.
9. Who demonstrated there are infinitely many primes? Answer: Euclides.
10. Use of primes in technology: Answer: Criptografia.

Wait, looking back at the example provided by the user, some answers are more detailed than others. For instance, one answer was "número composto." So perhaps I should make sure that the answers are short and fit within 10 words.

I think these questions cover a good range without overlapping too much. Each addresses a different aspect of prime numbers as per the context.
