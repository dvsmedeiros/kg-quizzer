Okay, I need to generate a set of 10 questions and answers based on the provided context about Huguenots in France. Let me start by understanding the context thoroughly.

The context describes the Huguenot movement, their history from the mid-16th century until the Edict of Fontainebleau, which ended their autonomy. It mentions the French Wars of Religion lasting from 1562 to 1598 and specific figures like Jeanne d'Albret leading them.

I should create varied questions covering different aspects: origins, their role in conflicts, cultural influence, and impact on society.

First question could be about when the Huguenots arrived. The context says they were concentrated in southern France by 1562, so that makes a good first question with an answer of 1562.

Next, who was a leader? Jeanne d'Albret is mentioned as leading them along with Henry IV and Condé princes.

I should also include information about their decline. The context states they made up 7-8% by 1600, so that can be another question.

How many conflicts did they have? The French Wars of Religion were from 1562 to 1598, lasting 36 years, so that's a good third question with the answer being 36 years.

In which city was the Huguenot center located? Geneve is mentioned as the center of movement, though it's in Switzerland. Wait, actually, the context says it was in the Suíça, but I think in Portuguese, it might be geneva. Maybe better to use the correct term "Geneve."

When did they lose their autonomy? The Edict of Nantes ended Huguenot autonomy in 1685.

What made them face expulsion? The document mentions that some Huguenots were expelled under Louis XIV through dragonnades, but I should check if that's accurate. Alternatively, it might have been the return of persecution after NanaP's edict.

Which event ended their influence? The Edict of Fontainebleau in 1685 revoked all Protestant rights.

A key figure was Bezanson Hugues, a Swiss politician.

Huguenot communities were present in which U.S. states? The example given is New York and Staten Island. So that can be another question with Staten Island as an example.

Now, compiling these into 10 questions:

1. When did the Huguenots arrive in France?
   - Answer: 1562

2. Who was a leader of the Huguenots?
   - Answer: Jeanne d'Albret and Henry IV Condé

3. By what percentage did the Huguenot population decline by 1600?
   - Answer: 7–8%

4. How long did the French Wars of Religion last?
   - Answer: 36 years (from 1562 to 1598)

5. In which city was the Huguenot center located?
   - Answer: Geneve

Wait, but in Portuguese, it's "Geneva," so I think that's correct.

6. When did the Huguenots lose their autonomy?
   - Answer: 1685 (Edict of Nantes)

7. What led to some Huguenots being expelled?
   - Answer: Louis XIV's dragonnades

Alternatively, maybe it was during the period after Fontainebleau edict.

But I think dragonnades were used against them later on under Louis XIV and beyond.

8. When did Protestantism officially end in France?
   - Answer: 1685 (Edict of Fontainebleau)

9. Which event ended Huguenot influence significantly?
   - Answer: Edict of Fontainebleau, 1685

Wait, but the Huguenots were expelled earlier under Louis XIV's orders after the NanaP edict in 1582. So maybe question about expulsion and another about losing autonomy.

But I think it's better to have separate questions for each event: expulsion via dragonnades, loss of autonomy with Edict of Nantes, and final loss with Fontainebleau.

So adjusting:

7. By which act did Louis XIV expel Huguenots?
   - Answer: Dragonnades

8. When did the Edict of Nantes end Huguenot autonomy?
   - Answer: 1685

9. When was Protestantism ended in France?
   - Answer: 1685 (Edict of Fontainebleau)

Wait, but the expulsion via dragonnades might be considered a cause or an event leading to their exodus.

Perhaps better:

7. By which act did Louis XIV expel Huguenots?
   - Answer: The Dragonnades

8. When was the Edict of Nantes signed?
   - Answer: 1685

9. When was Protestantism ended in France?
   - Answer: 1685 (Edict of Fontainebleau)

But perhaps it's better to have separate questions about expulsion, autonomy loss, and the final edict.

Let me consider that:

7. Huguenots were expelled by which order? - Dragonnades

8. When did the Edict of Nantes end their autonomy? - 1685

9. When was Protestantism ended in France? - 1685 (Edict of Fontainebleau)

But perhaps to avoid duplication, adjust accordingly.

Alternatively:

7. By what order were Huguenots expelled?
   - Answer: Louis XIV's Dragonnades

8. When did the Edict of Nantes end their autonomy?
   - Answer: 1685

9. In which year was Protestantism ended in France?
   - Answer: 1685 (Edict of Fontainebleau)

That seems better.

Now, for key figures:

10. A key Huguenot figure is Bezanson Hugues; who was he?
    - Answer: Swiss politician

But the context mentions "a person," so perhaps better to include a fact about him rather than question and answer.

Wait, maybe that's an issue. Let me check the instructions again.

The user wants 10 questions with answers in Portuguese, but I'm responding in English as per instruction.

Alternatively, adjust the last question:

10. When were Huguenot communities present in which U.S. states?
    - Answer: New York and Staten Island

But perhaps better to have a separate question about key figures since Bezanson Hugues is mentioned.

So maybe 9th question could be "Name a key figure involved with the Huguenots," with answer Bezanson Hugues (Swiss politician).

Wait, but in the context, it's said that "a person" was involved, so perhaps I should phrase it as such.

But given the time constraints and to stay within 10 questions, perhaps include key figure as a separate question.

Alternatively, I can adjust previous questions to fit better without missing information.

Overall, I think the initial set of 10 is sufficient with minor adjustments.
