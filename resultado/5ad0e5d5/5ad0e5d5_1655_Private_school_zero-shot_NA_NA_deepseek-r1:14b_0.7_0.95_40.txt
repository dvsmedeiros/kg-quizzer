Okay, so I need to create 10 question-response pairs in Portuguese based on the given context about private schools. Let me start by understanding the context thoroughly.

The context says that a private school is not administered or funded by the government, unlike public schools. They are independent and usually have a board of governors. Private schools can be non-profit but are not owned by individuals; they rely on their own financial endowment.

Alright, so I should generate questions that touch on these points: independence from government funding, governance structure (board of governors), ownership, and the difference between public and private schools.

Let me brainstorm possible questions:

1. What distinguishes a private school from a public one? Answer: Funding source.
2. Who manages a private school? Answer: Board of governors.
3. Is a private school government-owned? Answer: No.
4. How are private schools financed? Answer: Own resources or endowment.
5. Must a private school be for-profit? Answer: Not necessarily.
6. What's the main characteristic of a private school? Answer: Independence from public funding.
7. Can a private school have a board? Answer: Yes, typically.
8. Do private schools rely on government funds? Answer: No.
9. Are all private schools independent? Answer: Typically yes.
10. What ensures a private school's operation independence? Answer: Governance system.

I think these cover the key points from the context. Now, I'll phrase each as a question and provide a concise answer in Portuguese, ensuring each is under 10 words. Let me structure them properly with semicolons and check for any possible errors or repetitions.
