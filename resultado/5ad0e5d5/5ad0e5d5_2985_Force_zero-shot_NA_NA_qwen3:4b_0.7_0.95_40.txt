Okay, the user wants me to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the physics context provided. Let me start by understanding the context thoroughly.

The context talks about forces in physics, their definition, how they affect motion, the SI unit (newton), the relationship with mass and acceleration, and related concepts like thrust, drag, torque, internal stress, and pressure. 

I need to create questions that are relevant to this information. Each question should be a short, clear query, and the answers should be concise, up to 10 words. Let me brainstorm possible questions.

First, the definition of force. Then, the SI unit. Next, the relationship between force, mass, and acceleration. Maybe questions on related concepts like thrust, drag, torque. Also, internal stress and pressure. How force affects velocity. The direction of force. The original form of Newton's second law. And maybe something about the vector nature of force.

Let me check if I have 10 unique questions. Let's list them:

1. What is the definition of a force in physics?
2. What is the SI unit of force?
3. How is acceleration related to net force and mass?
4. What is a thrust in the context of forces?
5. What is drag in physics?
6. What is torque in the context of force?
7. How does internal mechanical stress affect a body?
8. What is pressure in the context of force?
9. How does a force affect the velocity of an object?
10. What is the direction of a force?

Now, I need to make sure the answers are accurate and within the word limit. Let me verify each answer against the context.

1. Force is an influence changing an object's motion.
2. Newt (SI unit is newton, but the answer should be "newton").
3. Acceleration is directly proportional to net force and inversely proportional to mass.
4. Thrust increases velocity.
5. Drag decreases velocity.
6. Torque produces changes in rotational speed.
7. Internal stresses balance, so no acceleration.
8. Pressure is a type of unbalanced stress causing acceleration.
9. Force can cause acceleration, changing velocity.
10. Force has direction, making it a vector.

I think that's all. Now, format them into the CSV structure as per the example. Make sure each line is separated by a semicolon and no extra text. Check for any possible mistakes. Alright, that should do it.
