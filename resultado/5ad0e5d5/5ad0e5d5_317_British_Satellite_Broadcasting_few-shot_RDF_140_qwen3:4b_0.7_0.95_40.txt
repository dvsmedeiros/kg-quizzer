Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the provided context about British Satellite Broadcasting (BSB). Let me start by understanding the context thoroughly.

The context mentions that BSB was a TV company based in London, started broadcasting on March 25, 1990, and was merged with Sky Television plc on November 2, 1990 to form British Sky Broadcasting. There are also some triples and facts about BSB's ownership of TV channels and production companies.

First, I should identify key points from the context that can be turned into questions. The main points are the company's name, location, start date, merger date, and the merger result. Also, the facts mention that BSB owned several TV channels and production companies.

I need to make sure each question is unique and covers different aspects. For example, one question could be about the location, another about the start date, another about the merger, and others about the channels or companies they owned.

I should avoid repeating the same type of question. Let me list possible questions:

1. Where was BSB headquartered?
2. When did BSB start broadcasting?
3. When was BSB merged with Sky?
4. What was the result of the merger?
5. What is the name of the merged company?
6. Which TV channels did BSB own?
7. What production companies was BSB involved in?
8. What is the name of the company that BSB was merged with?
9. What was the fate of BSB according to the facts?
10. What is the original name of the merged company?

Now, I need to check the context to ensure the answers are accurate. For example, the merger result is British Sky Broadcasting, the merged company is Sky Television plc, and the fate is "Merged with Sky Television plc to form BSkyB."

I should also check the examples given in the context. The facts include BSB owning channels like Galaxy, Now, The Computer Channel, etc., and production companies like Hardware, Memphis Belle, etc.

I need to make sure the answers are concise, under 10 words. Let me structure each pair accordingly. Also, ensure that the questions are in Portuguese and the answers are in Portuguese as well.

Let me verify each answer against the context. For example, the answer to "Onde BSB estava sediada?" is "Londres." The start date is "25 de março de 1990." The merger date is "2 de novembro de 1990," and the result is "British Sky Broadcasting."

For the channels, the answer should be "Galaxy, Now, The Computer Channel, The Movie Channel, The Power Station." For the production companies, "Hardware, Memphis Belle."

The name of the merged company is "Sky Television plc," and the fate is "Merged with Sky Television plc to form BSkyB."

I need to ensure that each question is distinct and that the answers are directly from the context. I should avoid using vague or incorrect information. Let me check each point again to confirm accuracy.

Once I have all 10 questions and answers, I'll format them into the CSV format as specified, with each line being "pergunta;resposta".
