Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the provided context and facts. Let me start by understanding the context thoroughly. The context is about computational complexity theory, which classifies computational problems based on resource usage and relates these classes. It mentions that problems are considered inherently difficult if their solution requires significant resources. The theory uses mathematical models to study problems and quantify their complexity, such as time and storage. Other measures include communication, circuit gates, and parallel processors. The P vs NP problem is highlighted as a Millennium Prize Problem. Related fields are analysis of algorithms and computability theory.

Now, looking at the facts, there are various people associated with computational complexity theory, like Peter Bürgisser, Scott Aaronson, Christos Papadimitriou, etc. Also, there are models and images related to the theory, such as Turing machine diagrams and complexity classes. The theory is categorized under several types and has specific templates used in its documentation.

I need to ensure that the questions are varied and cover different aspects of the context. Let me brainstorm possible questions:

1. What is the main focus of computational complexity theory? (Answer based on classifying problems by resource usage)
2. Which problem is highlighted as a Millennium Prize Problem? (P vs NP)
3. What are the primary resources measured in computational complexity? (Time and storage)
4. What distinguishes computational complexity from computability theory? (Resource restrictions)
5. What is a problem considered inherently difficult? (Requires significant resources)
6. What are the related fields to computational complexity theory? (Analysis of algorithms and computability theory)
7. What mathematical models are used in computational complexity theory? (Models of computation)
8. What is the role of computational complexity theory in practical computing? (Determine limits of what computers can do)
9. What other measures of complexity are mentioned besides time and storage? (Communication, circuit gates, processors)
10. What is the significance of the P vs NP problem? (One of the Millennium Prize Problems)

I need to check if these answers are directly from the context or can be inferred. For example, the answer to question 2 is explicitly mentioned. Also, the distinction between computational complexity and computability theory is in the context. The related fields are also stated. I should avoid repeating similar questions and ensure each answer is unique and within the given context. Also, the answers should be concise, under 10 words. Let me structure them into CSV format as specified, using semicolons as separators.
