Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user has provided a bunch of RDF data in a specific format, and they want me to generate a CSV file based on certain instructions and rules. First, I need to understand what exactly is required here.

Looking at the instructions, the user wants the CSV to have the following columns: URI, Label, and Value. The URI is the subject of the triple, the Label is the predicate, and the Value is the object. However, there are some exceptions mentioned, like when the predicate is "ns1:barWidth" or "ns1:data", which should be handled differently.

Let me start by parsing the provided RDF data. Each line seems to be a triple in the format of subject predicate object. For example, one line is:

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Construction> ns1:barWidth "30" ;
    ns1:data "201.2",
        "36.3",
        "839.1",
        "92.6" ;

Here, the subject is <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Construction>, and there are multiple predicates. The "ns1:barWidth" has the value "30", and "ns1:data" has multiple values separated by commas.

The first step is to extract each triple. For each subject (URI), I'll list all predicates (Labels) and their corresponding objects (Values). However, there are special cases for "ns1:barWidth" and "ns1:data". For "ns1:barWidth", it's straightforward: each URI has one value. For "ns1:data", the user mentioned that it should be split into separate rows, each with a single value. So if "ns1:data" has multiple values, each should be a separate entry under the same URI.

Wait, the instruction says: "For the predicate 'ns1:barWidth' and 'ns1:data', we need to split the values into separate rows." So, for example, if a subject has "ns1:barWidth" with value "30", that's one row. If "ns1:data" has multiple values like "201.2", "36.3", etc., each should be a separate row with the same URI and the corresponding value.

So, the plan is:

1. Iterate through each triple in the provided data.
2. For each triple, extract the URI (subject), Label (predicate), and Value (object).
3. For predicates "ns1:barWidth" and "ns1:data", split the values into separate rows.
4. Collect all these entries into a CSV with columns URI, Label, Value.

Now, looking at the data, I need to process each line. Let's take the example line again:

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Construction> ns1:barWidth "30" ;
    ns1:data "201.2",
        "36.3",
        "839.1",
        "92.6" ;

Here, the URI is <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Construction>.

For "ns1:barWidth", the value is "30", so that's one row.

For "ns1:data", there are four values: "201.2", "36.3", "839.1", "92.6". Each of these should be a separate row with the same URI and the respective value.

So, that line would generate 5 rows (1 for barWidth and 4 for data).

Another example: if a subject has multiple predicates, each with their own values, each predicate-value pair becomes a row.

Now, I need to make sure that all such triples are processed correctly. Also, note that some entries might have multiple values for the same predicate, like "ns1:data" in the example above.

Another thing to watch out for is that some lines might have multiple predicates for the same URI. For instance, a line might have:

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/SomeSubject> ns1:somePredicate "value1" ;
    ns1:anotherPredicate "value2" ;

Each of these would be two separate rows.

Now, I'll need to parse each line, split the predicates and their values, handle the special cases, and then output the CSV.

Let me start by listing all the URIs and their associated triples. Then, for each URI, process each predicate and its values.

For the "ns1:data" predicate, the values are comma-separated. I need to split those into individual entries. For example, if the value is "201.2", "36.3", etc., each should be a separate row.

Also, some lines might have multiple values for "ns1:data" with different formatting, like:

ns1:data "201.2",
        "36.3",
        "839.1",
        "92.6" 

Which I need to parse as four separate values.

Another point: the "ns1:wikiPageUsesTemplate" and "skos:closeMatch" etc. are other predicates. Those should be included as well, but since they don't have special handling, they just get their own rows.

So, putting it all together, the CSV will have rows for each URI, each predicate, and each value, with the exception that for "ns1:barWidth" and "ns1:data", the values are split into multiple rows.

Now, the user also mentioned that the CSV should have the columns URI, Label, Value. So each row in the CSV corresponds to one triple (subject, predicate, object), with the exception of splitting the "ns1:data" into multiple rows.

So, the final CSV will have entries like:

URI,Label,Value
<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Construction>,ns1:barWidth,"30"
<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Construction>,ns1:data,"201.2"
<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Construction>,ns1:data,"36.3"
<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Construction>,ns1:data,"839.1"
<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Construction>,ns1:data,"92.6"

And so on for each triple.

I need to make sure that all such entries are processed correctly, handling the special cases for "ns1:barWidth" and "ns1:data".

Now, I'll proceed to parse the provided data, split the triples, handle the special cases, and generate the CSV accordingly.
