Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the provided context and facts. Let me start by understanding the context. The immune system is described as a network protecting against diseases, detecting pathogens, and having innate and adaptive subsystems. The facts list various components like cells (T cells, B cells, macrophages, etc.), diseases related to immune system dysfunction (autoimmune, immunodeficiency), and some terminology.

First, I should ensure the questions are varied and cover different aspects: structure, function, components, diseases, and terminology. Let me check the example given to match the format. Each question should have a concise answer, up to 10 words. Avoid repeating similar questions.

Looking at the context, I can ask about the main functions, the two subsystems, components like T cells, diseases like autoimmune and immunodeficiency, and maybe the role of specific cells. The facts mention several cells (like Langerhans cells, mast cells, etc.), so including questions about those would be good. Also, the mention of vaccination in the context relates to immunological memory, which is a key point.

I need to make sure each answer is directly from the context or facts. For example, "What are the two main subsystems?" would answer with "innate versus adaptive." Another question could be about the role of the immune system, which the context says is to protect against diseases. 

I should also check for any repeated topics. For instance, autoimmune diseases are mentioned, so a question about that. Immunodeficiency is another key point. Also, the fact that the immune system includes cells like neutrophils, monocytes, etc., so a question about components. 

Let me list possible questions:
1. What is the primary function of the immune system? (Answer: Protect against diseases.)
2. What are the two main subsystems? (Answer: Innate versus adaptive.)
3. What are the two types of immunity? (Answer: Humoral versus cellular.)
4. What are the two types of immunodeficiency? (Wait, the context mentions immunodeficiency as a result of genetic, acquired, or medication. Maybe not. Alternatively, the answer could be "genetic versus acquired.")
Wait, the context says immunodeficiency can be genetic (like SCID), acquired (HIV/AIDS), or due to meds. So maybe the answer is "genetic, acquired, or medication-induced." But the answer needs to be concise. Maybe "genetic versus acquired." But the example in the user's sample has "imunidade humoral versus imunidade mediada por células" as an answer. So perhaps the two types are humoral and cellular. Wait, the context says "adaptive (or acquired) immunity creates immunological memory." So maybe the two types are innate and adaptive. The user's example has "imunidade humoral versus imunidade mediada por células." But the context says "the two major subsystems of the immune system" are innate and adaptive. So the answer to the question about the two main subsystems would be "innate versus adaptive." 

Another question: What are the two types of immunity? The context mentions adaptive (acquired) and innate. Wait, the context says "the two major subsystems of the immune system" are innate and adaptive. The adaptive system is also called acquired. So maybe the answer is "innate versus adaptive." 

Wait, the example given in the user's sample includes "Quais são os dois tipos diferentes de imunidade?;imunidade humoral versus imunidade mediada por células." So that's humoral and cellular. But the context says "adaptive (or acquired) immunity creates an immunological memory." So humoral (antibodies) and cellular (T cells) are the two types. So perhaps the question should be about the two types of adaptive immunity. 

I need to make sure each question has a unique answer. Let me proceed step by step, ensuring each answer is directly from the context or facts. Also, check for repetition. Let me draft 10 pairs now.
