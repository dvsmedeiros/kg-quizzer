Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format, using the provided context and triples. The main topic is computational complexity theory. First, I need to make sure I understand the context well. The abstract explains that computational complexity theory classifies problems based on resource usage, relates these classes, and discusses concepts like P vs NP, resources like time and storage, and related fields like algorithm analysis and computability theory.

Looking at the triples, they list several people associated with computational complexity theory, but I think those are more for examples and might not be necessary unless the questions are about notable figures. However, the user's example doesn't include those, so maybe focus on the abstract and the main concepts.

Now, the example given has questions about classification, attributes, problems, measures, methods, resources, units, practical roles, related fields, and analysis of algorithms. I need to ensure my questions are varied and cover different aspects of the context.

Let me brainstorm possible questions. The first one could be about the main focus of computational complexity theory. Then, maybe the classification of problems, the resources used, the P vs NP problem, related fields, the difference between algorithm analysis and complexity theory, measures like communication complexity, the role of computational complexity, the study of algorithms, and the distinction between complexity and computability.

I need to make sure each answer is concise, under 10 words, and derived from the context. Also, avoid repeating similar questions. Let me check each point against the context to ensure accuracy. For example, the P vs NP problem is mentioned as one of the Millennium Prize Problems, so that's a valid question. The resources are time and storage, as per the abstract. The related fields are analysis of algorithms and computability theory. The difference between the two fields is that algorithm analysis looks at specific algorithms, while complexity theory is more general.

I should also check for other measures like communication complexity and circuit complexity, which are mentioned in the abstract. The practical role is determining the limits of what computers can do. The study of computational complexity involves classifying problems based on resources. The distinction from computability theory is the restriction on resources.

Okay, compiling these into questions and answers, ensuring they are unique and cover various aspects. Let me list them out and count to make sure there are 10. Then format them into CSV with semicolons. Need to avoid any markdown and just provide the CSV as specified.
