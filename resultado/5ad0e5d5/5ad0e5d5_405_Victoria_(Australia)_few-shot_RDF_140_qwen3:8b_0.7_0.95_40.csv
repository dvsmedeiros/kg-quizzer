The user wants a CSV with specific columns. According to the instructions; the columns should be:
Let me start by listing all the triples. For "Victoria_(Australia)"; the properties include:
For other resources like "Brian_Cox"; the properties might be:
I need to make sure that the URI column is the full URL of the resource. For example; "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Victoria_(Australia)".
The Label would be the name of the resource; like "Victoria (Australia)".
In the absence of explicit types; perhaps the Type column can be left as empty or filled with "Resource" as a default.
For example; for the first entry:
- **Property**: Predicado (ex.: `ns1:febRecordHighC`; `foaf:depiction`).
O CSV inclui apenas os recursos explicitamente listados no dado fornecido; mantendo a estrutura e os valores conforme as regras.
