Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the provided context about the Huguenots. Let me start by understanding the context thoroughly.

The context mentions that the Huguenots were French Protestants following Calvinism, the term's origin from a Swiss leader, their concentration in southern and western France, the French Wars of Religion from 1562-1598, the Edict of Nantes granting them autonomy, and their decline under Louis XIV with the Edict of Fontainebleau in 1685. Also, there's info about their population percentages, persecution, and diaspora.

Now, I need to create varied questions. Let me list key points:

1. Origin of the term "Huguenot" – possibly from a Swiss leader.
2. Location of Huguenots in France.
3. Population percentage in 1572.
4. End of French Wars of Religion.
5. Key leaders like Jeanne d'Albret and Henry IV.
6. Edict of Nantes and its provisions.
7. Decline under Louis XIV and dragonnades.
8. Effects of the Edict of Fontainebleau.
9. Persecution under Louis XV.
10. End of persecution with the Edict of Versailles.

I should avoid repeating similar questions. Let me check for uniqueness. For example, one question about the term's origin, another about location, another about population stats, etc.

Each answer should be concise, up to 10 words. Let me ensure the answers are directly from the context. For example, the Edict of Nantes granted them autonomy. The population was around 10% in 1572. The wars ended with that Edict. The term might be from a Swiss leader. The Huguenots were in southern and western France. Louis XIV's Edict of Fontainebleau ended their rights. The wars lasted from 1562-1598. The Camisards were a subgroup. The persecution under Louis XV continued. The Edict of Versailles ended official persecution.

I need to structure these into 10 pairs, ensuring each is distinct and answers are correct. Let me format them as CSV with semicolons. Check for any repetition and ensure answers are within the word limit. Also, make sure the questions are clear and directly related to the context. Alright, I think that covers it. Let me put them all together now.
