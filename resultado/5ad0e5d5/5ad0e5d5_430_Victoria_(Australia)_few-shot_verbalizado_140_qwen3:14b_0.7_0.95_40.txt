Okay, let's see. The user wants me to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the given context and facts. The context is about Victoria, Australia, and the facts include various people, places, and events associated with Victoria.

First, I need to make sure I understand the context thoroughly. Victoria is a state in southeastern Australia, second smallest in area, second most populated, most densely populated. It's bordered by New South Wales and South Australia, and has a diverse economy. Melbourne is the capital and the second-largest city in Australia. There's also information about its history, population, and cultural aspects.

Next, looking at the facts provided. There are a lot of names of people born or died in Victoria, places located there, and some events. For example, "1909 Inter-State Series está localizado em Victoria (Australia)" and "Rory Sloane nasceu em Victoria (Australia)".

The task is to create 10 varied questions with answers based on these. The answers need to be concise, up to 10 words, in Portuguese, and in the format "pergunta;resposta".

I need to ensure that the questions don't repeat and cover different aspects of Victoria. Let's start with the context first. For example, questions about population, geography, economy, history, etc. Then use the facts for specific people, places, events.

For example, from the context: "Victoria is the second most populated state after New South Wales" → "Qual é a segunda maior população entre os estados australianos?;Victoria".

Another from the context: "Melbourne is the capital of Victoria and the second largest city in Australia" → "Qual é a capital de Victoria e a segunda maior cidade da Austrália?;Melbourne".

From the facts, "Rory Sloane nasceu em Victoria (Australia)" → "Onde Rory Sloane nasceu?;Victoria".

I need to make sure each answer is directly from the context or facts, and not inferred beyond that. Also, check for uniqueness and variety in the questions. Let me list out possible questions and answers.

1. Qual é a segunda maior população entre os estados australianos?;Victoria
2. Qual é a capital de Victoria e a segunda maior cidade da Austrália?;Melbourne
3. Qual é a área territorial de Victoria?;227.444 km²
4. Em que ano Victoria foi separada da Nova Gales do Sul?;1851
5. Qual é o recorde de temperatura alta de Victoria em fevereiro?;48,8 °C
6. Onde está localizado o Museum of Australian Democracy at Eureka?;Victoria
7. Qual é a segunda maior economia entre os estados australianos?;Victoria
8. Em que ano Melbourne se tornou a maior cidade da Austrália?;1901
9. Qual é a densidade populacional de Victoria?;28 por km²
10. Qual é a linguagem aborigine mais comum em Victoria?;Kulinic languages

Wait, the context mentions "Kulinic languages" as part of the region. Also, the facts mention "Kulinic languages pertence à região Victoria (Australia)". So that's a valid answer. However, the context says "more than 30 Aboriginal languages" were spoken, but the specific mention of Kulinic languages in the facts can be used.

I need to ensure that each answer is correctly derived. Let me check each:

1. Correct, Victoria is second most populated.
2. Correct, Melbourne is capital and second largest city.
3. The area is 227,444 km², as stated in the context.
4. Separated in 1851, as per context.
5. The record in February is 48.8°C, from the facts.
6. Museum of Australian Democracy at Eureka is located in Victoria, from the facts.
7. Economy is second largest, context says "second-largest among Australian states".
8. Melbourne became the largest city in Australasia by 1901, context says "By the time of Australian Federation in 1901, Melbourne had become the largest city in Australasia".
9. Density is 28 per km², from context.
10. Kulinic languages are mentioned in the facts as part of Victoria's region.

That seems to cover different aspects. Now, check for repetition. Each question is unique. Answers are concise. Now, format them as CSV with semicolons.

Make sure the answers are in Portuguese and match the facts. Also, check for any typos or formatting issues. For example, "227.444 km²" uses a comma as decimal separator in Portuguese. Wait, in Portuguese, the comma is used as decimal separator, but in the context, it's written as "227,444 km²". However, in the user's facts, it's written with a period, like "Victoria (Australia) possui recorde de temperatura alta em fevereiro (°C) 48.8". But in Portuguese, the decimal separator is a comma, so 48,8. However, the context uses a period. Wait, the original context says "recorde de temperatura alta em fevereiro (°C) 48.8". But in Portuguese, it should be 48,8. But the user's facts have "48.8", so maybe the user is using periods. However, the user might expect Portuguese formatting. Hmm, this is a bit conflicting. But since the user provided the facts with periods, maybe they want to keep the same format. But in Portuguese, it's a comma. This might be a point to clarify, but since I have to follow the facts as given, I'll use the same decimal separator as in the facts, which is a period.

So, answer 5 would be "48.8 °C".

Similarly, for the area, the context says "227,444 km²", but the user's facts might use periods. Wait, the context says "227,444 km²" (comma), but in the user's input, the context is written with a comma as the decimal separator. However, in the user's input, the context is written in English, so maybe they used a comma for thousands separator. Wait, no, in the context, the area is written as "227,444 km²", which in English uses a comma as the thousands separator. But in Portuguese, it's a period. However, the user's input is in English, so maybe they just followed the original formatting. But since the answer needs to be in Portuguese, maybe the numbers should follow Portuguese conventions. But the user hasn't specified this. This is a bit tricky. However, the user's facts include "Victoria (Australia) possui recorde de temperatura alta em fevereiro (°C) 48.8", which uses a period. So, I'll use the same format for consistency, even though in Portuguese it's a comma. But the user might not care as long as the number is correct.

Proceeding with the generated questions and answers as above.
