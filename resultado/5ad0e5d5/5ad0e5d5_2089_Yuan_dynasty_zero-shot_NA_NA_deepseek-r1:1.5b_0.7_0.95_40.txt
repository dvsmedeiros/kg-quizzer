Okay, I need to generate 10 pairs of question-response in Portuguese, based on the provided context about the Yuan dynasty. The user wants each pair as "pergunta; responder" and then a CSV with separated by semicolon.

First, I'll read through the context carefully to extract key points. The Yuan dynasty was established by Kublai Khan around 1271 and lasted until 1368. It was succeeded by the Ming dynasty in 1279. The Yuan empresses were the successors of Möngke.

I should focus on important events, rulers, or significant dates related to the dynasty. Maybe include some political decisions or key events like the victory against the Yuan forces at Yamen in 1279.

Here's a plan:

1. Question about when the Yuan dynasty was established.
2. Question about Kublai Khan and his role.
3. Question about the succession of emperors.
4. Question about the duration of the dynasty.
5. Question about the subsequent ruler after the Yuan dynasty.
6. Question about how the Yuan dynasty is considered in other dynasties.
7. Question about political decisions, like Yamen victory.
8. Question about the succession after Yamen victory.
9. Question about rival emperors and their influence.
10. Question about the succession of emperors influenced by the Yuan dynasty.

Now I'll formulate each question and get the corresponding response from the context to ensure accuracy.

I should make sure that the responses are concise, up to 10 words, and in Portuguese. Also, separate them with semicolon as per the instructions.
