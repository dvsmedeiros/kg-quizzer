Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs in Portuguese based on the given context about packet switching in telecommunications. Let me start by reading the context carefully to identify key points.

First, the main topic is packet switching. Key elements mentioned are: packets consist of header and payload, Paul Baran's contribution in the 1960s, his term "distributed adaptive message block switching", fault-tolerant routing, contrast with pre-allocated bandwidth (Bell System), Donald Davies coining the term "packet switching", and the ARPANET incorporating the concept.

Now, I'll list possible questions for each of these points. For each question, the answer should be concise, up to 10 words. Let me ensure the answers are accurate and directly from the context. Also, need to avoid any markdown and use semicolons as separators. Let me check each pair to make sure they match the context and are in Portuguese.

1. What is the main component of packets in packet switching? Answer: Header and payload.
2. Who developed the concept of packet switching in the 1960s? Answer: Paul Baran.
3. What term did Donald Davies coin for packet switching? Answer: Packet switching.
4. What was the goal of Paul Baran's research? Answer: Fault-tolerant, efficient routing.
5. What organization funded Paul Baran's research? Answer: United States Department of Defense.
6. What was the name of Paul Baran's concept? Answer: Distributed adaptive message block switching.
7. Which network incorporated packet switching? Answer: ARPANET.
8. What did Paul Baran's concept contradict? Answer: Pre-allocation of network bandwidth.
9. Who was a key figure in promoting packet switching after Baran? Answer: Donald Davies.
10. What is the primary basis for data communications? Answer: Packet switching.

Now, translating these into Portuguese and ensuring the answers are correct and concise. Also, check for any repetition and that each question is unique. Make sure the answers are within the word limit and correctly formatted as CSV with semicolons.
