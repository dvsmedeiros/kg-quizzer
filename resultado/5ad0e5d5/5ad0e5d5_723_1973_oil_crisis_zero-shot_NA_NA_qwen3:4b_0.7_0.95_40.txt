Okay, the user wants me to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the provided context about the 1973 oil crisis. Let me start by understanding the context thoroughly.

The context mentions the start of the crisis in October 1973, led by OAPEC, particularly Saudi Arabia, targeting countries that supported Israel during the Yom Kippur War. The initial targets were Canada, Japan, Netherlands, UK, and the US, later expanding to Portugal, Rhodesia, and South Africa. The oil prices rose by 300%, from $3 to $12 per barrel, causing a global economic and political shock, known as the first oil shock, followed by the 1979 crisis as the second.

Now, I need to create 10 relevant questions. Each question should be concise and based on the key points in the text. The answers must be short, under 10 words. Let me brainstorm possible questions:

1. When did the 1973 oil crisis start? Answer: October 1973.
2. Which organization led the oil embargo? Answer: OAPEC, led by Saudi Arabia.
3. Which countries were initially targeted? Answer: Canada, Japan, Netherlands, UK, US.
4. What was the price increase of oil? Answer: 300% increase.
5. What was the global price of oil? Answer: From $3 to $12 per barrel.
6. What was the name of the first oil shock? Answer: First oil shock.
7. What were the effects of the embargo? Answer: Global political and economic effects.
8. Which countries joined later? Answer: Portugal, Rhodesia, South Africa.
9. What was the main reason for the embargo? Answer: Supporting Israel during Yom Kippur War.
10. What was the impact of the crisis? Answer: Short- and long-term global effects.

Wait, I need to check if all these are accurate. The context says the embargo was targeted at nations that supported Israel, so the main reason is the Yom Kippur War. The answer for the first question is correct. The price increase is 300%, from $3 to $12. The first oil shock is mentioned as the term used. The effects include political and economic impacts. The countries that joined later are Portugal, Rhodesia, and South Africa. The answer for the third question is correct. The main reason is the support for Israel during the war. The impact is both short and long-term. 

I think these are all valid. Let me format them into the CSV as specified, making sure each line is a question followed by the answer, separated by a semicolon. The final output should have 10 rows with the correct answers in Portuguese. Wait, the user said the language should be Portuguese. Oh, right! The questions and answers need to be in Portuguese. Wait, the example given by the user is in English, but the instructions say the language should be Portuguese. Wait, no, looking back: the example is in English, but the user's instruction says "Idioma: português". So the questions and answers should be in Portuguese. But the context is in English. Hmm, but the user provided the context in English, but the output should be in Portuguese. Wait, the user's instruction says: "Idioma português". So the questions and answers should be in Portuguese, even though the context is in English. So I need to translate the questions and answers into Portuguese.

Wait, but the example given by the user is in English. Let me check again. The example is in English, but the user's instruction says the language should be Portuguese. So I need to generate the questions and answers in Portuguese. So I need to translate each of the 10 points I had into Portuguese.

Let me rephrase the questions and answers in Portuguese:

1. Quando começou a crise do petróleo de 1973? Resposta: Outubro de 1973.
2. Qual organização liderou o embargo? Resposta: OAPEC, liderada pela Arábia Saudita.
3. Quais países foram inicialmente alvo? Resposta: Canadá, Japão, Países Baixos, Reino Unido e Estados Unidos.
4. Qual foi o aumento no preço do petróleo? Resposta: Aumento de 300%.
5. Qual foi o preço global do petróleo? Resposta: De US$3 para US$12 por barril.
6. Qual foi o nome do primeiro choque de petróleo? Resposta: Primeiro choque de petróleo.
7. Quais foram os efeitos do embargo? Resposta: Efeitos políticos e econômicos globais.
8. Quais países se juntaram depois? Resposta: Portugal, Rodesia e África do Sul.
9. Qual foi a razão principal do embargo? Resposta: Apoio à Israel durante a Guerra de Independência.
10. Qual foi o impacto da crise? Resposta: Efeitos curtos e longos no mundo.

Wait, the reason for the embargo is that the countries had supported Israel during the Yom Kippur War. So the answer should be "Apoio à Israel durante a Guerra de Independência" or "Apoio à Israel durante a Guerra de Outubro". But the original text says "Yom Kippur War", which is the Israel-Syria War of October 1973. So maybe "Guerra de Outubro" is more accurate. But the user's context says "Yom Kippur War", so perhaps "Guerra de Yom Kippur".

But in Portuguese, the Yom Kippur War is referred to as "Guerra de Yom Kippur" or "Guerra de Outubro". So maybe the answer should be "Apoio à Israel durante a Guerra de Yom Kippur".

But the user might prefer "Guerra de Outubro" as it's more commonly known. Hmm. The original text says "Yom Kippur War", so I should stick with that. So the answer would be "Apoio à Israel durante a Guerra de Yom Kippur".

Also, for the countries that joined later: Portugal, Rodesia (Rhodesia) and África do Sul (South Africa). So the answer is correct.

Now, I need to make sure all answers are under 10 words. Let me check:

1. Outubro de 1973. (5 words)
2. OAPEC, liderada pela Arábia Saudita. (7 words)
3. Canadá, Japão, Países Baixos, Reino Unido e Estados Unidos. (10 words)
4. Aumento de 300%. (5 words)
5. De US$3 para US$12 por barril. (7 words)
6. Primeiro choque de petróleo. (6 words)
7. Efeitos políticos e econômicos globais. (7 words)
8. Portugal, Rodesia e África do Sul. (6 words)
9. Apoio à Israel durante a Guerra de Yom Kippur. (9 words)
10. Efeitos curtos e longos no mundo. (6 words)

All answers are under 10 words. So this should be correct. Now, the final CSV should have these 10 pairs, each in the format "pergunta;resposta".

I need to make sure that the CSV has the correct encoding, but since the user just wants the CSV as text, I can present it as such.
