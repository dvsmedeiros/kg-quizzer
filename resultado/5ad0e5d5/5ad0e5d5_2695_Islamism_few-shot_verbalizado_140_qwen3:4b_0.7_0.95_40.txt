Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the provided context and facts. Let me start by understanding the context.

The context explains that Islamism is a political ideology aiming to reconstitute states according to Islamic principles. It mentions different strategies like revolutionary or reformist, the role of Sharia, and the influence of Islamist movements. There are also mentions of various groups and their ideologies.

Now, looking at the facts, there's a list of organizations with Islamism as their ideology. The examples include the Muslim Brotherhood, Hamas, Hezbollah, and others. Also, there's information about the term's usage, its historical figures, and the debate around it.

I need to make sure each question is unique and covers different aspects. Let's brainstorm possible questions:

1. What is the main goal of Islamism regarding society and government?
2. What are the two main strategies used by Islamist movements?
3. Which organizations are associated with Islamism according to the facts?
4. What is the term used to describe the political ideology that emphasizes Islamic principles?
5. What is the stance of some Islamist movements towards democracy?
6. What is the historical context of the term Islamism?
7. Which groups are mentioned as having Islamism as their ideology?
8. What is the debate surrounding the term Islamism?
9. What is the role of the Muslim Brotherhood in Islamist movements?
10. What is the difference between Islamist movements and Islamic extremists?

Now, checking the answers against the context and facts. For example, the answer to the first question would be "reordenação" (reorganization). The two strategies are "revolução ou invasão" (revolution or invasion) and "reformist" (reformist). The answer about the term is "Islamismo" (Islamism). The stance on democracy is "rejeitam inteiramente" (reject entirely). The historical context is the 20th century. The groups include the Muslim Brotherhood, Hamas, Hezbollah. The debate is about violent tactics and extremism. The Muslim Brotherhood is mentioned as a reformist group. The difference is that some use violent methods while others don't.

Need to ensure that each answer is concise and within 10 words. Also, avoid repeating similar questions. Let me check if all answers are correctly derived from the context. For example, the answer about the two strategies is from the text: "advocate a 'revolutionary' strategy... or alternately a 'reformist' strategy". The answer about the term is from the first sentence. The stance on democracy is from the text: "rejeitam inteiramente" based on the fact that some Islamist movements reject democracy. The historical context is from the mention of central figures in the 20th century. The groups are listed in the facts. The debate is about the term's implications. The Muslim Brotherhood is mentioned as a reformist group. The difference between movements and extremists is that some use violent methods while others don't.

Now, format each as a CSV line. Make sure to use the correct separators and avoid any extra text. Check for 10 lines. Let me list them out:
