Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the provided context about the Amazon rainforest. Let me start by understanding the context thoroughly.

The context mentions the Amazon rainforest spans most of the Amazon basin in South America, covering 5.5 million km², mainly in Brazil (60%), Peru (13%), Colombia (10%), and smaller parts in other countries. It also talks about the number of indigenous territories, the biodiversity with 390 billion trees and 16,000 species, and the population of 30 million people with 9% being indigenous. There's also mention of the name "Amazonas" in four countries and France's "Guiana Amazonian Park."

Now, I need to create 10 relevant questions. Let me brainstorm possible questions:

1. What is the total area of the Amazon rainforest? (Answer: 5,500,000 km²)
2. Which country has the largest portion of the Amazon rainforest? (Answer: Brazil)
3. How many indigenous territories are acknowledged in the Amazon? (Answer: 3,344)
4. What percentage of the Amazon is in Brazil? (Answer: 60%)
5. How many species of trees are estimated in the Amazon? (Answer: 16,000)
6. Which country has the "Guiana Amazonian Park"? (Answer: France)
7. How many people live in the Amazon region? (Answer: 30 million)
8. What percentage of the world's remaining rainforests does the Amazon represent? (Answer: Over half)
9. How many countries have "Amazonas" as a region name? (Answer: Four)
10. What is the total area of the Amazon basin? (Answer: 7,000,000 km²)

Wait, I need to check if the answers are concise and under 10 words. Let me verify each answer:

1. "5,500,000 km²" – okay.
2. "Brazil" – yes.
3. "3,344" – but the question says "acknowledged indigenous territories," so the answer is 3,344. But the context says "3,344 formally acknowledged indigenous territories." So the answer is "3,344." But the question should be phrased as "How many formally acknowledged indigenous territories are there?" Maybe rephrase the question to make it clear.

Alternatively, maybe the question can be "How many indigenous territories are acknowledged in the Amazon?" with answer "3,344." But the user might prefer the answer to be a number. Let me adjust the questions to ensure the answers are accurate and concise.

Also, the answer to question 10 would be "7,000,000 km²." Let me make sure each answer is correct and fits the word limit. Once all are verified, format them into CSV with semicolons.
