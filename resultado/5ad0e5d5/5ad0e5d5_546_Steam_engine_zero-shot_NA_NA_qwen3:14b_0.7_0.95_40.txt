Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs based on the provided context about steam engines. Let me start by reading through the context carefully to identify key points.

First, the definition: a steam engine uses steam pressure to move a piston, converting that motion into rotational force. That's a good starting point for a question. Maybe "What is a steam engine?" with the answer being a heat engine using steam to perform mechanical work.

Next, the context mentions that steam engines are external combustion engines. That's another fact. So a question could be about the type of engine they are, and the answer would be external combustion.

The Rankine cycle is mentioned as the ideal thermodynamic cycle. That's a specific term, so a question asking about the cycle used would have that as the answer.

The difference between steam engines and steam turbines is noted. A question here could ask what steam engines are not, leading to the answer being steam turbines.

The example of the aeolipile from the first century AD is historical context. A question about the earliest known steam-driven device would use that.

Jerónimo de Ayanz y Beaumont's patent in 1606 for a steam-powered water pump is another historical point. So a question about the first steam-powered water pump inventor would have his name as the answer.

Thomas Savery's invention of the first commercially used steam pump is another key point. A question about who invented the first commercially used steam-powered device would answer with Savery.

Thomas Newcomen's engine in 1712 was the first commercially successful one that could transmit continuous power. A question on that date and inventor would be appropriate.

James Watt's improvement in 1764 by removing spent steam to a separate vessel for condensation is a critical point. A question about his contribution would highlight that.

The 19th century's use of stationary steam engines in the Industrial Revolution is another fact. A question on when they powered factories would answer with the 19th century.

I need to ensure that each answer is concise, under 10 words, and in Portuguese. Also, checking that all questions are relevant and cover different aspects of the context without repetition. Let me list them out in order and verify each one.
