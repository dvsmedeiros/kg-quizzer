Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the provided context and facts. Let me start by understanding the context and the facts given.

The context talks about Southern California, its geographical and cultural aspects, the counties it includes, borders with Arizona, Nevada, and Mexico, and specific locations like the Colorado Desert and Colorado River. The facts list various entities and their associations with Southern California, such as people born there, organizations based there, images associated with it, and more.

First, I should extract key points from the context. The main points are:
- Southern California is a region in California, comprising 10 counties.
- It includes Los Angeles metropolitan area.
- Borders with Arizona (Colorado Desert and Colorado River), Nevada (San Bernardino County), and Mexico (Baja California).
- The region's southern border is part of the U.S.-Mexico border.

From the facts, there are many entities like people, organizations, places, and images linked to Southern California. For example, Jordan Ifueko was born there, Rancho Guajome Adobe is located there, and there are specific images like "San Diego panoramic skyline at night.jpg."

Now, I need to create varied questions that cover these aspects. Each question should have a unique angle and a clear answer from the context or facts. Let's brainstorm some questions:

1. How many counties are included in Southern California?
   Answer: 10 counties.

2. Which river is located on the eastern border of Southern California with Arizona?
   Answer: Colorado River.

3. What is the name of the region that is part of the U.S.-Mexico border?
   Answer: Baja California.

4. Which metropolitan area is part of Southern California?
   Answer: Los Angeles metropolitan area.

5. What is the southernmost border of Southern California?
   Answer: Mexico–United States border.

6. Which organization is based in Southern California and has the name KFI?
   Answer: KFI (radio station).

7. What is the name of the image representing Southern California's skyline?
   Answer: San Diego panoramic skyline at night.jpg.

8. Which person was born in Southern California and is known as Jordan Ifueko?
   Answer: Jordan Ifueko.

9. What is the name of the desert located on the eastern border of Southern California?
   Answer: Colorado Desert.

10. Which county shares a border with Nevada in Southern California?
    Answer: San Bernardino County.

I need to check if these answers are present in the context or facts. For example, the context mentions 10 counties, the Colorado River and Desert, the border with Baja California, Los Angeles metropolitan area. The facts mention KFI, Jordan Ifueko, the image of San Diego skyline. San Bernardino County bordering Nevada is in the context. 

Now, I need to ensure that the answers are concise, within 10 words, and correctly derived. Also, avoid repeating similar questions. The example given in the user's instruction had questions about the abbreviation, number of municipalities, economic importance, etc. So I need to vary the topics: geography, people, organizations, images, borders, etc.

Another possible question could be about the type of entity Southern California is, but the context says it's a geographic and cultural region. However, the user might prefer more specific answers. Let's stick to the key points from the context and the facts.

I think the 10 questions I listed cover different aspects and are all based on the provided information. Now, I'll format them into CSV with semicolons.
