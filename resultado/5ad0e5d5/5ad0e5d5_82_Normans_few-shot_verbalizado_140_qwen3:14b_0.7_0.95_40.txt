Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the provided context and facts. Let me start by carefully reading the context and the facts to identify key points.

First, the context mentions that the Normans originated from the intermingling of Norse Vikings with West Franks and Gallo-Romans. That could be a good question about their origin. The answer would be the combination of those groups.

Next, the Treaty of Saint-Clair-sur-Epte established the Duchy of Normandy. So a question about the treaty's significance and the answer being the creation of the Duchy.

The text also states that the Normans adopted the French language and customs. A question on their cultural adoption could use that as the answer.

Looking at the facts, there's mention of the Norman conquest of England in 1066. That's a key event, so a question about when that happened with the answer being 1066.

Another fact is the religious shift from Norse paganism to Christianity. A question on their religion and the answer being Christianity.

The Channel Islands are remnants of the Duchy of Normandy. That's a good point for a question about their current status.

The Battle of Hastings is mentioned as a significant event. A question about that battle and its outcome could be addressed with the Norman conquest of England.

The use of Old Norman as a language is another point. A question about their language and the answer being Old Norman.

The Duchy of Normandy became a fief of France, so a question about its status under France.

Lastly, the Normans' influence in the Crusader states, like the Principality of Antioch, could be a question on their military impact.

I need to ensure each question is unique and covers different aspects. Also, the answers must be concise, under 10 words. Let me check for repetition and accuracy against the context and facts provided. Once confirmed, I'll format them as CSV with semicolons.
