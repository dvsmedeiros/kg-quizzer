Okay, I need to generate 10 CSV lines based on the given context about Harvard University. Let me start by reading through the provided information carefully.

First, the context mentions that Harvard was founded in 1636 by John Harvard, so that's a key fact. The university is a private Ivy League institution, the oldest in the US, and has a large library system with 79 individual libraries and 20.4 million items. It has an endowment of $50.9 billion, which is the wealthiest academic institution. The university has affiliated professional schools and has been transformed into a modern research university under Charles W. Eliot. It co-founded the Association of American Universities in 1900. James B. Conant led during the Great Depression and WWII. Alumni include eight US presidents and 150 Nobel laureates.

Looking at the facts provided, there are many names associated with Harvard. The example given includes people like John Simpkins, William Tan, Oliver S. Picher, etc., but the user's example in the instructions had questions about the founder, co-founding the Association of American Universities, and the number of presidents. However, the user's example didn't use the names from the facts list, so maybe I should focus on the main facts rather than individual names unless the question is about them.

Wait, the user's example included questions like "Qual indivíduo recebeu o nome da escola?" with the answer "John Harvard". So maybe I should use the names from the facts list, but the user's example had a different approach. However, the user's example had answers that were not in the facts list, like "John Harvard" and "Charles W. Eliot". Wait, in the context, it says "Founded in 1636 as Harvard College and named for its first benefactor, the Puritan clergyman John Harvard..." So John Harvard is the founder. Also, Charles W. Eliot is mentioned as the president who transformed it into a research university.

Looking at the facts list, there are many names, but the user's example in the instructions didn't use those names. The user's example had answers like "John Harvard", "1977", "James Bryant Conant", etc. So maybe the questions should be about the founder, the year when the college became coeducational, the leader during the Great Depression, the co-founding of the Association of American Universities, the number of presidents, the number of Nobel laureates, etc.

But the user's example in the instructions had 10 questions. Let me check the user's example again. They had questions like:

- Qual indivíduo recebeu o nome da escola?;John Harvard
- Quando o curso de graduação se tornou coeducacional?;1977
- Qual era o nome do líder durante a Grande Depressão e a Segunda Guerra Mundial?;James Bryant Conant
- Que organização Harvard encontrou em 1900?;Associação de Universidades Americanas
- Que presidente da universidade a transformou em uma moderna universidade de pesquisa?;Charles W. Eliot
- Qual é o maior sistema de bibliotecas acadêmicas e privadas do mundo?;Harvard Library,
- Quantas bibliotecas individuais compõem a biblioteca principal da escola?;79 bibliotecas individuais
- Quantos volumes estão contidos na biblioteca?;18 milhões de volumes.
- Quantos presidentes dos EUA são ex-alunos da escola?;oito presidentes dos EUA,
- Quantos ganhadores do Nobel estão entre os ex-alunos da escola?;150 ganhadores do Nobel,

So those are all based on the context provided. Now, the user's facts list has a lot of names, but maybe those are for other questions. However, the example given in the instructions doesn't use those names, so maybe the user wants the main facts about Harvard.

But the user's instruction says to use the content provided (the abstract, triples, and few-shots) as the base. The abstract mentions that Harvard was founded by John Harvard, that Charles W. Eliot transformed it into a research university, that it co-founded the Association of American Universities in 1900, that James B. Conant led during the Great Depression and WWII, the number of libraries, the endowment, the number of presidents, the number of Nobel laureates, etc.

So I need to generate 10 questions based on these facts. Let me list possible questions:

1. Who was the first benefactor of Harvard University? (John Harvard)
2. When did Harvard become coeducational? (1977)
3. Who was the president during the Great Depression and WWII? (James B. Conant)
4. Which organization did Harvard co-found in 1900? (Associação de Universidades Americanas)
5. Who transformed Harvard into a modern research university? (Charles W. Eliot)
6. What is the largest academic library system in the world? (Harvard Library)
7. How many individual libraries are in Harvard's main library system? (79)
8. How many volumes are in Harvard's library? (18 million)
9. How many U.S. presidents are Harvard alumni? (eight)
10. How many Nobel laureates are Harvard alumni? (150)

But the user's example already includes these. However, the user's example has some typos, like the answer for the first question is "John Harvard", which is correct. The answer for the second question is 1977, which is correct as per the context. The answer for the third question is James Bryant Conant. Wait, in the context, it says "James B. Conant led the university through the Great Depression and World War II..." So that's correct.

So I can use those as the questions. But the user's example has 10 questions, but in the context provided, the answer for the year when Harvard became coeducational is 1977, which is mentioned in the context. The context says: "The university is composed of ten academic faculties plus Harvard Radcliffe Institute. The Faculty of Arts and Sciences offers study in a wide range of undergraduate and graduate academic disciplines, and other faculties offer only graduate degrees, including professional degrees. Harvard has three main campuses: the 209-acre (85 ha) Cambridge campus centered on Harvard Yard; an adjoining campus immediately across Charles River in the Allston neighborhood of Boston; and the medical campus in Boston's Longwood Medical Area. Harvard's endowment is the largest in the world, at $50.9 billion. The university has been transformed into a modern research university under the leadership of Charles W. Eliot. Harvard co-founded the Association of American Universities in 1900. James B. Conant led the university through the Great Depression and World War II."

So the answer for the coeducational year is 1977, which is correct. The user's example has that. So I can use that.

But the user's example has questions that are based on the context, so I can generate similar questions. However, the user's instruction says to use the facts list provided. Wait, the facts list has a lot of names, but the example in the instructions didn't use those. Maybe the user wants the main facts, not individual names.

So the 10 questions would be based on the main points from the context. Let me check again.

Yes, the answer for the first question is John Harvard. The answer for the second question is 1977. The answer for the third is James B. Conant. The fourth is the Association of American Universities. The fifth is Charles W. Eliot. The sixth is Harvard Library. The seventh is 79 libraries. The eighth is 18 million volumes. The ninth is eight presidents. The tenth is 150 Nobel laureates.

So those are the 10 questions. Now, I need to format them into CSV with the correct answers. The user's example has some typos, like "oito presidentes dos EUA," which is "eight U.S. presidents". Also, the answer for the library volume is "18 milhões de volumes", which is "18 million volumes".

I need to make sure that the answers are correctly translated and match the context. So the final CSV should have 10 lines with the questions and answers as per the context and the example.
