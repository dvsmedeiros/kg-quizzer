Okay, the user wants me to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the given context about imperialism. Let me start by understanding the context thoroughly.

The context defines imperialism as a state policy involving expansion through territorial acquisition or economic/political control, using both hard and soft power. It mentions it's distinct from colonialism and empire. So, the questions should revolve around the key aspects of this definition.

First, I need to ensure each question is relevant and tests understanding of the core concepts. Let me brainstorm possible questions. Maybe start with the main definition, then differentiate it from related terms like colonialism. Also, include elements like hard and soft power, and the purpose of imperialism.

I should check that each answer is concise, under 10 words. For example, the definition could be answered with "Expansion through territorial or economic control." Then, the difference between imperialism and colonialism might be "Imperialism is broader, including non-territorial control."

I need to make sure the questions are varied and cover different aspects: definition, related concepts, methods used (hard and soft power), and the purpose. Let me list possible questions and their answers, ensuring they are in Portuguese as per the instructions.

Wait, the user specified the language as Portuguese. So all the questions and answers must be in Portuguese. I need to translate the key terms accurately. For example, "hard power" becomes "poder duro" and "soft power" is "poder suave."

Also, the example given has the format "pergunta;resposta" in the CSV. I have to make sure that each line in the CSV is properly formatted with the semicolon separator and that there are no extra characters.

Let me start drafting the questions and answers. First question: What is the main characteristic of imperialism? Answer: Expansion through territorial or economic control. Second: How does imperialism differ from colonialism? Answer: Imperialism includes non-territorial control. Third: What are the two types of power used in imperialism? Answer: Poder duro and poder suave.

Continue this way, ensuring each answer is short. Check that all answers are under 10 words. Also, avoid repetition. Maybe include the purpose of imperialism, the methods used, and examples of control. Ensure the questions are clear and the answers directly address the context provided.

Once I have all 10, I'll format them into the CSV as specified, making sure each line is correctly separated by semicolons and that there are no trailing spaces or errors. Double-check the Portuguese terms for accuracy. That should cover it.
