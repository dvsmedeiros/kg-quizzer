Okay; I need to create a CSV based on the given instructions and the provided data. Let me start by understanding the requirements.
The "Kublai Khan" entry mentions his death place; which is the Yuan Dynasty. The "Kublai_Khan" node has a deathPlace attribute pointing to the Yuan Dynasty. 
The "Yuan Dynasty" node also has a "s" property with "Ming dynasty" and "Phagmodrupa dynasty" as successors; but the main successor is the Ming Dynasty. 
Now; I need to structure the CSV entries. The example given has entries like:
6. Key events: Enthronement of Genghis Emperor (from "eventPre"); Fall of Khanbaliq (from "eventEnd")
