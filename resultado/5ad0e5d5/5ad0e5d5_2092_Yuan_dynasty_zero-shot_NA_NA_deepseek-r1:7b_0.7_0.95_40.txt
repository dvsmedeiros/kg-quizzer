Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs based on the provided context about the Yuan dynasty. Each pair should be in CSV format with only one correct answer.

First, I'll read through the context carefully to identify key points that can be turned into questions. The context covers Kublai Khan's establishment, timeline, neighboring territories, language usage by emperors, historical significance, and references like "Mandate of Heaven."

I should ensure each question is clear and directly relates to the content. The answers need to be concise and accurate.

Let me list out potential questions:

1. When was the Yuan dynasty established?
2. Who founded the Yuan dynasty?
3. What territories did the Yuan dynasty control initially?
4. Which emperors used Chinese instead of Mongolian?
5. How many rulers ruled the Yuan dynasty?
6. After which empire did Kublai Khan claim succession?
7. Where were the Yuan emperors from?
8. When was the Yuan dynasty replaced by the Ming dynasty?
9. What title did Kublai Khan also use?
10. Under whose leadership did the Yuan dynasty end?

Now, I'll create the answers based on the context:

1. 1271
2. Kublai Khan
3. Northern China and Mongolia
4. Some of his successors
5. 6 rulers (from 1271 to 1368)
6. The Song dynasty
7. From the Borjigin clan
8. 1368
9. Great Khan
10. Kublai Khan's grandfather, Genghis Khan

I'll format these into a CSV with each question and answer on separate lines.
