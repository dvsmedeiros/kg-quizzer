Okay, the user wants me to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the provided context about Fresno. Let me start by reading through the context carefully to identify key points.

First, the main facts: Fresno is a major city in California's San Joaquin Valley, the county seat of Fresno County, the largest city in the Central Valley, population stats, its founding as a railway station, economic role, proximity to other cities and parks, and demographic information. Also, the drought impact on water security.

I need to make sure each question is relevant and the answers are concise, under 10 words. Let me brainstorm possible questions. For example, what is Fresno's status as a city? Its population in 2020? When was it founded? What's its economic role? Its location relative to other cities? National parks nearby? Hispanic population percentage? Metro population in 2022? Its position as the most populous inland city? And the impact of droughts.

Now, I need to phrase each question clearly and ensure the answers are accurate based on the context. Let me check each point again to avoid mistakes. For instance, the population in 2020 is 542,107, and the metro population is 1,008,654 as of 2022. Founded in 1872 as a railway station, incorporated in 1885. Economic hub for the county and valley. Located near the geographic center of California. Proximity to Yosemite, Kings Canyon, and Sequoia parks. 50.5% Hispanic in 2020. Droughts affecting water security since 2010.

I should structure each pair in the CSV format, using semicolons. Let me count to ensure there are exactly 10. Avoid repetition and ensure each question is distinct. Also, check that answers are brief. Once done, verify the format matches the example provided.
