Okay, I need to generate a quiz based on the given information about Jacksonville, Florida. Let me start by understanding the requirements.

The user provided an abstract and a list of triples (facts) about Jacksonville. My task is to create 10 varied and relevant question-answer pairs in Portuguese, following the CSV format with semicolons as separators.

First, I'll read through the abstract to get a general idea. It mentions Jacksonville's population, its ranking in the U.S., geographical details like being on the St. Johns River, historical facts about Fort Caroline, and economic aspects.

Looking at the triples, there are various points: famous people born there (like Fred Durst), sports teams, military presence, educational institutions, and more. I should ensure each question is unique and covers different aspects to make the quiz comprehensive.

I'll start by identifying key areas to cover:
1. Population statistics
2. Historical facts
3. Geography and landmarks
4. Military significance
5. Economy and tourism
6. Nicknames and origin of the city's name

Now, I'll go through each fact and see how it can be turned into a question.

For example, from the abstract: Jacksonville is the most populous city in Florida proper. That's a good starting point for a question about population ranking.

Another example: The Timucua people inhabited the area before Fort Caroline. This leads to a question about the original inhabitants.

I should also use specific facts like the city being named after Andrew Jackson and its nickname "The River City."

I need to make sure each answer is concise, no more than 10 words, and in Portuguese. Let me structure each pair accordingly, ensuring variety so that questions cover different aspects of Jacksonville.

Finally, I'll compile these into a CSV format as specified, making sure there are exactly 10 pairs without repetition.
