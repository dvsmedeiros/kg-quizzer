Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the provided context and facts. Let me start by understanding the context. The main topic is steam engines, their working principles, historical developments, and applications. 

First, I'll look for key points in the context. The steam engine is a heat engine using steam as the working fluid, converting pressure into mechanical work via a piston. The Rankine cycle is the ideal thermodynamic cycle for analyzing this process. Thomas Newcomen and James Watt are mentioned as key inventors. Also, steam engines were replaced by electric and internal combustion engines in the early 20th century.

Now, the facts list various ships and historical items using steam engines, but I need to focus on the main concepts from the context. Let's brainstorm possible questions:

1. What is the primary working fluid in a steam engine?
2. Which thermodynamic cycle is used to analyze steam engines?
3. What type of engine is a steam engine?
4. Who developed the first commercially successful steam engine?
5. What innovation did James Watt make to improve steam engines?
6. What replaced steam engines in commercial usage by the early 20th century?
7. How does a steam engine convert steam pressure into mechanical work?
8. What is the role of the Rankine cycle in steam engines?
9. What was the first commercially used steam-powered device?
10. What is the main difference between steam engines and steam turbines?

Now, I need to ensure each question has a concise answer, is unique, and based on the context. Let me check each against the context:

1. Working fluid: steam. Correct.
2. Rankine cycle. Correct.
3. External combustion engine. From the context.
4. Thomas Newcomen. Yes, he developed the first successful one.
5. Removing spent steam for condensation. That's Watt's improvement.
6. Electric and internal combustion engines. The context mentions this.
7. Piston movement via connecting rod and crank. From the explanation.
8. Analyzes the process. The context says it's used to analyze the process.
9. Steam pump by Thomas Savery. The text mentions Savery's invention.
10. Steam turbine replaced reciprocating engines. The context states this.

Now, I need to phrase each question clearly, ensure answers are under 10 words, and format as CSV. Avoid repetition and ensure variety in question types (some factual, some conceptual). Let me compile the list now.
