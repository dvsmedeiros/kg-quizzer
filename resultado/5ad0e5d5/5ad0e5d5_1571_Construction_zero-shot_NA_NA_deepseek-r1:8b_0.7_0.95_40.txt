Okay, so I need to create a quiz based on the provided context about construction. The task is to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format, each with one relevant question and a correct short answer in Portuguese. Each line should be separated by semicolons.

First, I'll read through the context carefully to identify key points that can be turned into questions. The context mentions that construction starts with planning, financing, design, etc., so maybe a question about the first steps would work. 

Next, it talks about construction contributing to GDP and having a significant global expenditure. That's a good topic for another question. There's also information about safety in construction, specifically mentioning fatalities in the US, which could be another relevant point.

The context also mentions that construction covers repairs, maintenance, expansion, etc., so asking what activities fall under construction is appropriate. The term "constructio" from Latin and Old French might be a good question on etymology.

Global expenditure figures are provided for 2012, 2020, and 2030, which can form questions about those specific years. Non-monetary benefits of construction can be another topic. Finally, the impact on GDP and the percentage in 2030 seem like good points for the last few questions.

I'll structure each question to target these specific areas, ensuring the answers are concise and directly related to the context. I need to make sure the Portuguese is accurate and the responses are correct.
