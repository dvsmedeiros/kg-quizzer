Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the provided context about Victoria, Australia. Let me start by reading through the context carefully to identify key points.

First, the context mentions Victoria is the second-smallest state in Australia by land area. That's a good fact for a question. The answer would be "227,444 km²" or similar. Wait, the exact number is 227,444 km², so the answer should be precise.

Next, the population details: Victoria is the second most populated after New South Wales with over 6.5 million. That's another question. The answer is straightforward.

The most densely populated state in Australia with 28 per km². That's a key point for another question.

Borders: Victoria is bordered by New South Wales to the north and South Australia to the west. That's a good fact for a question.

The Bass Strait to the south, except for a small border with Tasmania. That's a specific detail. Maybe a question about the southern boundary.

Geographical features: Victorian Alps in the northeast and semi-arid north-west. That's a question on geographical diversity.

Population concentration in Port Phillip Bay and Greater Melbourne. That's a key point. The answer would mention Melbourne as the capital.

Cities: Four largest cities in Victoria are Melbourne, Geelong, Ballarat, and Bendigo. That's a question about the cities.

Cultural diversity: 35.1% of inhabitants are immigrants. That's a demographic question.

Aboriginal groups: Boonwurrung, Bratauolung, etc. The question could ask for an example of an Aboriginal group.

Wait, the context also mentions the Victorian gold rush increasing population and wealth. That's a historical fact.

Separation from New South Wales in 1851, named after Queen Victoria. Another historical question.

Melbourne as the federal capital until 1927. That's a historical fact.

Economy: Second-largest in Australia, service sectors. That's an economic fact.

Governor: Linda Dessau is the current Governor. That's a current fact.

Local government areas: 79 local government areas. That's a question on administration.

I need to ensure each question is unique and covers different aspects. Let me list out possible questions:

1. What is Victoria's land area?
2. Which state is Victoria the second most populated after?
3. What is Victoria's population density?
4. What states border Victoria to the north and west?
5. What body of water borders Victoria to the south?
6. What geographical features are found in Victoria?
7. Where is Victoria's population mainly concentrated?
8. What are the four largest cities in Victoria?
9. What percentage of Victoria's population are immigrants?
10. What is the capital of Victoria?

Wait, the answer to the capital is Melbourne, which is mentioned in the context. Also, the Governor's name is Linda Dessau.

I should check if all these questions are covered and not overlapping. Let me make sure each answer is under 10 words. For example, the population density answer is "28 per km²" which is within the limit.

Now, structuring the CSV with each question and answer. Need to ensure the order is correct and the answers are accurate based on the context.
