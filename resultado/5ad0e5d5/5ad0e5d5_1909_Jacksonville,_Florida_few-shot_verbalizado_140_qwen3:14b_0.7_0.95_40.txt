Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the provided context and facts. Let me start by carefully reading the context and the list of facts to identify key points that can be turned into questions.

First, the context mentions Jacksonville's population, its status as the largest city by area, the consolidation with Duval County in 1968, its location on the St. Johns River, the Timucua people, Fort Caroline, Andrew Jackson's influence, and the military presence. The facts include various locations, historical figures, events, and statistics like population numbers, temperatures, and infrastructure.

I need to ensure that each question has a unique answer derived directly from the context or facts. Let me list possible questions:

1. What is Jacksonville's population as of 2020? (Answer: 949,611)
2. Which river does Jacksonville straddle? (Answer: St. Johns River)
3. In which year did Jacksonville consolidate with Duval County? (Answer: 1968)
4. What is the name of the French colony established in 1564? (Answer: Fort Caroline)
5. Who is Jacksonville named after? (Answer: Andrew Jackson)
6. What is the nickname of Jacksonville, Florida? (Answer: "Jax", "The River City", "The Bold New City of the South")
7. What is the highest temperature recorded in Jacksonville, Florida in March? (Answer: 91°F)
8. What is the population of the Jacksonville metropolitan area? (Answer: 1,733,937)
9. Which indigenous group inhabited the area before the French arrived? (Answer: Timucua)
10. What is the ranking of Jacksonville's population among U.S. cities? (Answer: 12th)

Now, I need to check if these answers are all present in the context or facts. For example, the population in 2020 is mentioned in the context. The river is also there. The consolidation year is in the context. Fort Caroline is in the context. Andrew Jackson's name is there. The nickname is mentioned. The temperature record is in the facts. The metropolitan area population is in the context. Timucua is in the context. The 12th ranking is in the context.

I should make sure not to repeat similar questions. Also, the answers should be concise, under 10 words. The format needs to be CSV with semicolons. Let me structure each line correctly.
