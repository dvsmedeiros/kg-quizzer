Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs in Portuguese based on the given context about the Yuan Dynasty. Let me start by reading through the context carefully to understand the key points.

First, the Yuan Dynasty was established by Kublai Khan in 1271, lasted until 1368. It was the first dynasty by a non-Han group. The Mongols were led by the Borjigin clan. The dynasty followed the Song and preceded the Ming. The conquest was completed in 1279 with the Battle of Yamen. The Northern Yuan continued after the Ming took over. Kublai claimed the Mandate of Heaven, and the dynasty's name was "Great Yuan." He also used the title of Great Khan. The Mongol Empire's division led to different khanates. Some Yuan emperors knew Chinese, others used Mongolian. The Phags-pa script was used.

Now, I need to form questions that are relevant. Let me think of possible questions. For example, when was the Yuan Dynasty established? Who founded it? What was the official name? What dynasty came before and after? When did the conquest end? What was the Northern Yuan? What title did Kublai Khan use? What script was used? What was the Mandate of Heaven? What was the significance of the Battle of Yamen?

Now, the answers need to be concise, up to 10 words. Let me check each one. For instance, "When was the Yuan Dynasty established?" The answer is "Em 1271." That's short. "Who founded the Yuan Dynasty?" "Kublai Khan." "What was the official name?" "Grande Yuan." "Which dynasty preceded the Yuan?" "Song." "Which came after?" "Ming." "When did the conquest end?" "Em 1279." "What is the Northern Yuan?" "Estado rêmio após a queda da Yuan." "What title did Kublai use?" "Grande Khan." "What script was used?" "Phags-pa." "What is the Mandate of Heaven?" "Legitimidade imperial."

Wait, I need to make sure the answers are correct according to the context. The Mandate of Heaven is mentioned as being borne by the Yuan in official histories. So "Legitimidade imperial" makes sense. The Phags-pa script is mentioned. The Northern Yuan is the rump state. The Battle of Yamen in 1279. The conquest was completed then. The answer for the conquest end is "Em 1279." The Northern Yuan is "Estado rêmio após a queda da Yuan." 

I need to check for 10 pairs. Let me list them out:

1. Quando a Dinastia Yuan foi estabelecida?; Em 1271.
2. Quem fundou a Dinastia Yuan?; Kublai Khan.
3. Qual era o nome oficial da dinastia?; Grande Yuan.
4. Qual dinastia precedeu a Yuan?; Dinastia Song.
5. Qual dinastia sucedeu a Yuan?; Dinastia Ming.
6. Quando o cerco terminou?; Em 1279.
7. O que é a Yuan do Norte?; Estado rêmio após a queda da Yuan.
8. Qual título Kublai usou?; Grande Khan.
9. Qual script foi usado?; Phags-pa.
10. O que é o Mandato do Céu?; Legitimidade imperial.

That's 10. Let me check if any answers are too long. All are under 10 words. The questions are in Portuguese. The format is correct with semicolons. I think this meets the requirements.
