Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the provided context about civil disobedience. Let me start by understanding the context thoroughly. The context explains that civil disobedience is the active refusal to obey certain laws, typically nonviolent, and mentions historical figures like Thoreau, Susan B. Anthony, Saad Zaghloul, Gandhi, and Martin Luther King Jr. It also quotes King's view on respecting the law through civil disobedience.

First, I should identify key points from the context. The main elements are: definition of civil disobedience, its nonviolent nature, historical examples, and the philosophical stance of respecting the law through it. Each question should target these aspects. 

For the first question, maybe ask for the definition. The answer would be the first sentence. Then, another question about the nonviolent aspect. Next, who popularized the term? Thoreau's essay. Then, examples of leaders inspired by it. Maybe include the Egyptian Revolution and Gandhi's role. Also, King's perspective on civil disobedience. 

I need to ensure the answers are concise, up to 10 words. Let me check each possible question. For example, "What is civil disobedience?" Answer: "Active refusal to obey unjust laws." That's under 10 words. 

Another question: "What is required for civil disobedience to be 'civil'?" Answer: "Nonviolent actions." Then, who popularized the term? "Henry David Thoreau." 

For historical examples: "Who led the Egyptian Revolution of 1919?" Answer: "Saad Zaghloul." Then, "What did Gandhi use civil disobedience for?" Answer: "Indian independence." 

King's view: "What did King say about civil disobedience?" Answer: "Expresses highest respect for law." 

Also, mention the suffrage movement: "Which movement did Susan B. Anthony lead?" Answer: "U.S. women's suffrage." 

Need to make sure each answer is accurate and fits the word limit. Let me list out 10 pairs, ensuring they cover different aspects of the context without repetition. Check for clarity and correctness. Finally, format them into CSV with semicolons.
