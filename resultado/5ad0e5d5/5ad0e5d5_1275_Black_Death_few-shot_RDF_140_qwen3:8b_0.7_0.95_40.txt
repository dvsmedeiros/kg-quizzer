Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the provided context about the Black Death. Let me start by understanding the context thoroughly. The Black Death was a pandemic from 1346 to 1353, causing massive deaths, originating in Central Asia or East Asia, spread via Genoese ships, and had significant social and economic impacts.

First, I should identify key points from the context. The origin is disputed, with some suggesting Central Asia and others East Asia, but the text mentions Kyrgyzstan in the late 1330s as a possible origin. The spread via fleas on rats and later person-to-person via pneumonic plague. The death toll is 75-200 million, with Europe losing 30-60% of its population. The impact on population recovery until the 1500s. Also, the role of the Oriental rat flea, Yersinia pestis, and the connection to the Mongol conquests. The example mentions that the initial spread might not be due to Mongol conquests as previously thought.

Now, I need to create varied questions. Let me brainstorm possible questions:

1. When did the Black Death occur? (1346-1353)
2. How many people died? (75-200 million)
3. Where did it start? (Central Asia or East Asia)
4. How did it spread initially? (Genoese ships, fleas on rats)
5. What caused the rapid inland spread? (Pneumonic plague)
6. What was the population loss in Europe? (30-60%)
7. When did the population recover? (Until 1500)
8. What is the primary vector? (Oriental rat flea)
9. What bacterium causes it? (Yersinia pestis)
10. What is the significance of the 1330s in Kyrgyzstan? (Possible origin, not Mongol conquests)

Wait, need to check if these are all unique and cover different aspects. Let me make sure each question is distinct and answers are directly from the context. Also, the answers need to be concise, up to 10 words. Let me verify each point against the context text. For example, the origin is disputed, so the answer should reflect that. The spread via ships and then person-to-person. The death toll numbers. The population recovery until 1500. The Oriental rat flea as the primary vector. Yersinia pestis as the bacterium. The Kyrgyzstan surge in 1330s suggesting origin not from Mongol conquests. Also, mention the 14th-century population decline and the role of pneumonic plague in spread.

Now, structure each question-answer pair, ensuring the answers are accurate and concise. Avoid repeating the same type of questions. For example, one about origin, one about spread, one about death toll, one about impact, etc. Let me compile them into CSV format with commas, making sure the answers are within the word limit.
