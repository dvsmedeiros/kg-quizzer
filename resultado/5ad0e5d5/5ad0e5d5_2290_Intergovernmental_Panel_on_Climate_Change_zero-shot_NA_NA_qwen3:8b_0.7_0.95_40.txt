Okay, the user wants me to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the provided context about the IPCC. Let me start by understanding the context thoroughly. The text talks about the IPCC's establishment, its role in climate change research, the structure with working groups, the assessment cycles, reports, and their impact, like the Paris Agreement and Nobel Prize.

First, I need to identify key points that can be turned into questions. For example, who established the IPCC? The answer would be WMO and UNEP. Then, when was it established? 1988. The secretariat location is Geneva, Switzerland. The member states are 195. The assessment cycle duration is six to seven years. The IPCC doesn't conduct original research, so that's a fact. The Nobel Peace Prize in 2007 with Al Gore. The sixth assessment cycle started in 2015 and ends in 2023. The AR6 report's publication dates for each working group. The Special Reports like the 1.5°C one from 2018. The Synthesis Report is due in March 2023. Also, the role of the IPCC in UNFCCC negotiations.

I need to make sure each question is clear and the answers are concise, under 10 words. Let me check for any other important details. The IPCC's three working groups and the task force. The peer review process involving thousands of experts. The reports being used by governments and organizations. The endorsement by member states and leading scientists. The impact on the Paris Agreement. 

Now, structure each pair as per the CSV format, using semicolons. Avoid any markdown and ensure the output is just the CSV. Let me list out the 10 questions and answers, making sure they are accurate and concise. Double-check the dates and names to prevent errors. Once done, format them correctly in the CSV structure.
