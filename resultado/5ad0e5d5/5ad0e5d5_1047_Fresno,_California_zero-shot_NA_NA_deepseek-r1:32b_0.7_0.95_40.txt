Okay, I need to generate a quiz based on the given context about Fresno. Let me read through the context carefully.

First, I'll note down key points: Fresno is in California's San Joaquin Valley, it's the county seat of Fresno County and the largest city in the Central Valley. Its population was 542,107 in 2020, making it the fifth-most populous city in California. The metro area had 1,008,654 people in 2022. It was founded in 1872 as a railway station and incorporated in 1885. Fresno is known for ash trees along the San Joaquin River, which gives it its name.

Economically, it's an agricultural hub. Geographically, it's near the center of California, about 220 miles north of LA, 170 south of Sacramento, and 185 southeast of SF. Nearby parks include Yosemite (60 mi north), Kings Canyon (60 mi east), and Sequoia (75 mi southeast). Fresno is the third-largest majority-Hispanic city with 50.5% Hispanic population in 2020. Statewide droughts since 2010 have affected water security.

I should create 10 questions covering these aspects: location, population stats, founding details, economy, geography, parks proximity, demographics, and challenges like droughts.

Let me structure each question to extract one key fact from the context, ensuring clarity and brevity. The answers must be concise, within 10 words, in Portuguese, using semicolons as separators.

I'll start by listing potential questions:

1. Where is Fresno located?
2. When was Fresno founded?
3. What's its population rank in California?
4. Which parks are nearby?
5. What's the main economic activity?
6. How far from LA is Fresno?
7. Which river has ash trees giving Fresno its name?
8. What percentage of Hispanic population in 2020?
9. Metro population as of 2022?
10. Impact of droughts since 2010?

Now, I'll translate these into Portuguese, ensuring they fit the CSV format.

Double-checking each answer against the context to confirm accuracy.
