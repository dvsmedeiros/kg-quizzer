Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the provided context about prime numbers. Let me start by understanding the context thoroughly. 

First, the context explains that prime numbers are natural numbers greater than 1 that aren't products of smaller numbers. Composite numbers are those that can be divided by more than two numbers. The fundamental theorem of arithmetic is central here, stating that every number greater than 1 is either prime or a product of primes. There's mention of primality testing methods like trial division, Miller-Rabin, and AKS. Also, the largest known prime is a Mersenne prime with 24,862,048 digits as of 2018. There are unsolved problems like Goldbach's conjecture and the twin prime conjecture. Primes are used in cryptography and have applications in abstract algebra.

Now, I need to create varied questions. Let me list possible topics: definition of primes, composite numbers, fundamental theorem, primality tests, largest known prime, historical context, applications, unsolved problems, examples of primes, and properties like uniqueness in factorization.

Let me check for unique questions. For example, the first question could be about the definition of a prime. The second about composite numbers. Third, the fundamental theorem. Fourth, the unique factorization. Fifth, the largest known prime. Sixth, the primality test methods. Seventh, the AKS test. Eighth, the Mersenne primes. Ninth, the historical proof by Euclid. Tenth, the use in cryptography.

Wait, the context mentions the largest known prime as a Mersenne prime with 24.8 million digits as of 2018. The example in the few-shots includes 2,147,483,647, which is a Mersenne prime. So the question about the largest known prime should reference that. Also, the twin prime conjecture is mentioned. 

I need to ensure each question has a unique answer and is based on the context. Let me structure each pair:

1. What is a prime number? → natural number >1 with no divisors other than 1 and itself.
2. What are composite numbers? → numbers with more than two divisors.
3. What theorem states unique prime factorization? → fundamental theorem of arithmetic.
4. What is the property of being prime called? → primality.
5. What is the largest known prime's digit count? → 24,862,048 digits (as of 2018).
6. What is a common primality test? → trial division.
7. What is a fast but error-prone test? → Miller-Rabin.
8. What test is always correct but slow? → AKS.
9. What did Euclid prove about primes? → there are infinitely many.
10. What uses primes in cryptography? → public-key cryptography.

Wait, the example in the few-shots includes 2,147,483,647 as a prime. The context says the largest known prime as of 2018 is 24.8 million digits. So the answer for the largest known prime should be 24,862,048 digits. The question about the largest known prime should specify the date. 

Also, the context mentions the twin prime conjecture, but maybe that's covered under unsolved problems. The example about the largest known prime in the few-shots is 2,147,483,647, but the context says the largest known in 2018 is different. So the question should reference that. 

Let me check each answer against the context to ensure accuracy. For example, the answer about the largest known prime is 24,862,048 digits as of 2018. The question should mention that. 

Now, structuring the CSV with each question and answer, making sure answers are concise and directly from the context. Also, using the exact numbers and terms mentioned, like "fundamental theorem of arithmetic" and "Mersenne prime".
