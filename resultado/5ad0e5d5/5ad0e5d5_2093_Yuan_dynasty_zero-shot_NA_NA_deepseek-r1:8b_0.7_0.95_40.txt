Okay, so I need to create a quiz with 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the given context about the Yuan Dynasty. The questions should be relevant and the answers correct and concise, each pair separated by a semicolon.

First, I'll read through the provided context carefully to identify key points that can be turned into questions. The context is quite detailed, so I'll extract important facts like the duration of the dynasty, its relation to other empires, significant events, notable rulers, etc.

I should start with general knowledge about the Yuan Dynasty. For example, when was it established? That's a straightforward question. Then, who founded it? Kublai Khan is a key figure here.

Next, I can focus on the impact of the Mongol Empire's division and how the Yuan became a successor. Also, when did the Yuan forces conquer the Southern Song, leading to the unification?

The context mentions that the Yuan was isolated and controlled most of China and surrounding areas. That makes another good question about their territorial extent.

I should also include information about language usage by some rulers and the use of the Phags-pa script. This adds a cultural aspect to the quiz.

Then, when did the dynasty end before the Ming took over? The battle leading to their defeat is important context.

The Northern Yuan continuation is another point after the fall, so that's a relevant question.

Lastly, Kublai Khan's actions regarding Genghis Khan in imperial records and his claims of succession can be another question.

I'll make sure each answer is concise, up to 10 words, as per instructions. I'll structure them as simple statements without unnecessary details.

Now, I'll list these points as questions and provide the answers accordingly, ensuring they fit into the CSV format with semicolon separators.
