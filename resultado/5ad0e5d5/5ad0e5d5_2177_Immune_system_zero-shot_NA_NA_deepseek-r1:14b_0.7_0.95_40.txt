Alright, I need to create a CSV with 10 question-answer pairs based on the provided context about the immune system. Let me start by reading through the context carefully to understand the key points.

First, the immune system has two main subsystems: innate and adaptive. The innate system is non-specific and preconfigured, responding to a broad range of pathogens quickly. The adaptive system is more specific, learned, and uses memory cells for future threats. This distinction could form the basis of several questions, like differences between them or functions.

Next, there are various components mentioned, such as phagocytosis, defensins, complement system, B cells, T cells, antibodies, and cytokines. Each of these can be a question about their function or role in the immune response.

The context also discusses autoimmune diseases, immunodeficiency, cancer, and vaccination. These are important areas for questions, especially how they relate to immune dysfunction or applications like vaccines.

Now, I'll brainstorm potential questions. Starting with definitions: What is the immune system? Then subsystems: Difference between innate and adaptive. Components: Functions of phagocytosis, defensins, complement system. Pathogen recognition: By which cells? Adaptive features: Role of B and T cells, antibodies. Dysfunction: Examples of autoimmune diseases, causes of immunodeficiency. Applications: Basis of vaccination.

I need to ensure each question is clear and each answer is concise, up to 10 words. Let me structure them one by one, making sure they cover a broad range of topics from the context without overlapping too much.

For example:

1. What protects against pathogens? Answer: Sistema imunológico.
2. Innate vs adaptive response speed.
3. Phagocytosis function.
4. Defensins and complement system roles.
5. Pathogen recognition by cells (B, T).
6. Adaptive's learned aspect leading to memory.
7. Autoimmune diseases examples.
8. Immunodeficiency causes.
9. Basis of vaccination: adaptive immunity.
10. Cells fighting pathogens: B, T, antibodies.

I think this covers all main points and ensures a variety of questions. Now, I'll write them in Portuguese, keeping the answers short and accurate.

pergunta;resposta
O que protege o organismo de doenças?;Sistema imunológico
Qual é a diferença entre os sistemas imunes inato e adaptativo?;O inato é não-específico e rápido, o adaptativo é es pecífico e adquirido.
