Okay, the user wants me to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the given context about the Scottish Parliament. Let me start by understanding the context thoroughly.

The context provides detailed information about the Scottish Parliament, its structure, history, elections, and recent legislative changes. I need to create questions that test semantic knowledge, so they should be based on specific facts from the text.

First, I'll identify key points: the Scottish Parliament is a devolved legislature, located in Holyrood, Edinburgh, with 129 members. The election system includes both constituency and list members. The 2021 election, the Scotland Act 1998, the 2012 and 2016 acts, and the 2020 Internal Market Act.

Now, I need to form questions that ask for these specific details. For example, asking for the location, the number of members, the election system, the most recent election date, the key acts, and the purpose of the 2020 act.

I should ensure that each question is clear and that the answers are concise, under 10 words. Also, check that the answers are accurate based on the provided text. Avoid any questions that might be too vague or require inference beyond the given information.

Let me list possible questions and their answers:

1. Where is the Scottish Parliament located? Answer: Holyrood, Edinburgh.
2. How many members does the Scottish Parliament have? Answer: 129 members.
3. What is the election system for MSPs? Answer: Additional member system.
4. When was the most recent election? Answer: 6 May 2021.
5. Which act established the devolved legislature? Answer: Scotland Act 1998.
6. What expanded the Parliament's powers in 2012? Answer: Scotland Act 2012.
7. What did the 2016 act do? Answer: Expanded powers further.
8. What is the purpose of the 2020 Internal Market Act? Answer: Restrict devolved competences.
9. What is the main function of the Holyrood? Answer: Legislate on non-reserved matters.
10. Which system is used for constituency MSPs? Answer: First-past-the-post.

Wait, I need to make sure each answer is under 10 words. Let me check:

1. Holyrood, Edinburgh. (Yes)
2. 129 members. (Yes)
3. Additional member system. (Yes)
4. 6 May 2021. (Yes)
5. Scotland Act 1998. (Yes)
6. Scotland Act 2012. (Yes)
7. Expanded powers further. (Yes)
8. Restrict devolved competences. (Yes)
9. Legislate on non-reserved matters. (Yes)
10. First-past-the-post. (Yes)

That works. Now, I'll format them into the CSV as per the example. Make sure each line is a question followed by the answer, separated by a semicolon. No extra text, just the CSV.
