Okay, I'm supposed to generate a quiz based on the given context about Victoria, Australia. Let me go through the context step by step to identify key points that can be turned into questions and answers.

First, the context mentions that Victoria is the second-smallest state with an area of 227,444 km². That's a good fact for a question.

Next, it talks about the population being over 6.5 million and having the highest density at 28 per km². So two separate questions here: one about the population size and another about population density.

The neighboring states are New South Wales to the north and South Australia to the west. That's another question about its borders.

Victoria is surrounded by Bass Strait, Great Australian Bight, and Tasman Sea. Maybe a question about its surrounding bodies of water.

Culturally, 35.1% of residents are immigrants, which could be an interesting question regarding diversity.

There are four major cities: Melbourne, Geelong, Ballarat, Bendigo. That's perfect for a multiple-city question.

The capital is Melbourne, also Australia's second-largest city. Another straightforward question about the capital and its ranking.

Aboriginal languages: more than 30 were spoken before European colonization. A question about linguistic diversity.

European settlement began in 1803 at Sullivan Bay. That's a historical fact worth including.

Victoria became a separate colony in 1851, which is significant for its history.

The current Premier is Daniel Andrews from the Labor Party since 2014. A political leadership question.

Putting all these together, I can structure each as a question with a concise answer. Making sure to vary the topics—geography, population, economy, culture, history—to cover different aspects of Victoria.
