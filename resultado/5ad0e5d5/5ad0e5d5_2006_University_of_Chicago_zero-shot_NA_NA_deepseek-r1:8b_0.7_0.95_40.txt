Okay, so I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs based on the given context about the University of Chicago. Let me read through the context carefully to find relevant information.

First, the University of Chicago is a private research university located in Hyde Park, Chicago. They have multiple campuses and centers around the world. That could be a good starting point for questions.

They are highly ranked and selective. Maybe something about their acceptance rate or selectivity? But I need to keep the questions relevant but not too broad.

I see they have several professional schools listed: Law School, Booth School of Business, Pritzker School of Medicine, Crown Family School, Harris School of Public Policy, Divinity School, Graham School, and Pritzker School of Molecular Engineering. Perhaps asking about these schools or their names could be a good question.

The context also mentions that they've contributed significantly to various academic disciplines like economics, law, mathematics, etc., establishing the Chicago schools in those fields. That could lead to questions about the impact or influence of the university.

There's mention of the Metallurgical Laboratory and the first self-sustaining nuclear reaction. Fermilab and Argonne National Laboratory are part of their research efforts. Maybe a question about their involvement in scientific research or notable discoveries.

They have produced many notable alumni, including Nobel laureates, Fields Medalists, etc. Perhaps a question about famous alumni or Nobel winners could work well.

The University Press is the largest in the U.S., so that's another point to include.

I should ensure each question is unique and covers different aspects of the context provided. Let me list out potential questions:

1. Location of the main campus.
2. Number of professional schools.
3. Notable contribution to academic fields.
4. Involvement in scientific research (like Fermilab).
5. Largest university press in the U.S.
6. Selectivity or acceptance rate.
7. Nobel laureates among faculty or alumni.
8. Schools related to specific fields, like Molecular Engineering.
9. Impact of the carbon-14 dating revolution.
10. Total number of Olympic medalists from the university.

Now, I'll phrase each question in Portuguese, making sure they are clear and concise, and the answers are accurate and brief, up to 10 words each.
