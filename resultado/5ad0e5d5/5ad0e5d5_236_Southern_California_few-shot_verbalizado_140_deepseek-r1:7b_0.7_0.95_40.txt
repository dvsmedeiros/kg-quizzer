Alright, I need to generate a set of 10 unique questions and their corresponding short answers based on the given context about Southern California. The goal is to create these in CSV format with each question followed by its answer, separated by a semicolon.

First, I'll start by reading through all the provided information to extract key facts about Southern California. I notice that it includes details like its location within the U.S., the counties it encompasses, major cities nearby, notable landmarks, and even cultural references such as sports teams or historical events.

I should ensure that each question is distinct and covers different aspects of Southern California to avoid repetition. Each answer must be directly supported by the information provided so I'll need to carefully parse through the context for accurate responses.

For example, one of the facts mentions that Los Angeles has a subdivision called Southern California, so that can form the basis of one question. Another point states that Southern California is home to several counties like Imperial and Kern, which could lead to another question about its neighboring counties.

I'll also look for geographical features such as rivers or deserts mentioned in the context and formulate questions around those. Additionally, cultural elements like sports teams (KFI) or notable cities (John F. Kennedy High School) can be used to create relevant questions.

It's important to keep each question clear and concise, ensuring that the answer is a brief phrase rather than an extended explanation. This will help maintain consistency with the required format.

I'll proceed by going through each piece of information methodically, creating a question from what I find until I reach 10 unique pairs. I need to make sure there's no overlap in the topics addressed and that each entry is factually accurate based on the given context.
