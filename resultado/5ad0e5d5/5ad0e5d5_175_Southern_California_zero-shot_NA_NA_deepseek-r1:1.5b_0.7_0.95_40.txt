Okay, I need to create 10 pairs of questions and answers based on the given context about Southern California. Let me start by understanding what the user is asking for.

First, the context mentions several counties in Southern California: Imperial, Kern, Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, San Diego, Santa Barbara, San Luis Obispo, and Ventura counties. Also, it highlights some key areas like the Colorado Desert and the Colorado River, which are important geographical facts.

I should focus on extracting specific details from this context to create accurate questions and answers. Each question should have a clear answer that's concise and relevant to the information provided.

Let me think about possible questions:

1. Which county is the capital of Southern California? - Los Angeles
2. What is the state abbreviation for Southern California? CA
3. How many counties are in Southern California? 10
4. Is there a county named San Bernardino? Yes, San Bernardino County shares a border with Nevada to the northeast.
5. Does the Colorado River run through Southern California? Yes, it's on the eastern border.
6. What is the capital of San Bernardino County? There isn't one officially mentioned here; probably best to leave this as is.
7. Which county lies on the Mexico-United States border? Ventura County
8. How much land does Los Angeles County hold? 49% of California
9. Is there a county named Santa Barbara? Yes, Santa Barbara County shares a border with Nevada to the northeast.
10. What's the name of the county that borders both San Bernardino and Nevada? Santa Barbara

I need to make sure each answer is concise and within the limit provided. Also, I should check for any inaccuracies or omissions in the information.

Let me list them out:

1. Los Angeles is the capital.
2. CA
3. 10 counties
4. Yes, San Bernardino County borders Nevada.
5. Yes, Colorado River runs east through Southern California.
6. No official name mentioned.
7. Ventura County on Mexico-United States border.
8. 49% of California land in Los Angeles County.
9. Santa Barbara County borders both San Bernardino and Nevada.
10. Santa Barbara

These questions cover the main points from the context and should be appropriate for a multiple-choice format.
