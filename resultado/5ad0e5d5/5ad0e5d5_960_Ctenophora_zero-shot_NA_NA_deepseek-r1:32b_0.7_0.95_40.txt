Okay, so I need to create 10 question-answer pairs based on the given text about Ctenophores. Let me read through the context carefully and note down key points.

First, I see that Ctenophora are marine invertebrates known as comb jellies. They use cilia for swimming, which gives them their name. They’re the largest animals using cilia to swim. Sizes vary from a few millimeters up to 1.5 meters. There are about 100-150 validated species with possibly another 25 not fully described.

The body structure includes a jelly-like mass with two-cell layers externally and internally. They have various forms like cydippids, platyctenids, and beroids. Almost all are predators, feeding on small creatures, except some juveniles that are parasites.

Fossils date back to the early Cambrian, about 525 million years ago. Their phylogenetic position is debated; some think they're the second-earliest animal lineage after sponges, others argue they emerged earlier than sponges.

Now, I'll convert these points into questions and answers in Portuguese, keeping them short and relevant.

1. What do Ctenophores use for swimming? They use cilia arranged in bands called combs.
2. How big can adult Ctenophores be? Up to 1.5 meters long.
3. How many species are validated? Between 100 and 150, with about 25 more possibly existing.

Continuing this way, I'll cover their predators, body composition, types of species, exceptions, fossils, phylogenetic debates, and unique genes affecting studies.

I need to ensure each question is clear and the answer is concise, fitting within the CSV format specified. Also, making sure all answers are in Portuguese as per instructions.
