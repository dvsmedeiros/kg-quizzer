Okay, I need to generate 10 pairs of questions and answers based on the provided context about EU law. Let me start by reading through the text carefully.

The EU is a supranational system of laws within the European Union, operating since 1952. It promotes peace, social justice, economic opportunities, full employment, and environmental protection. The Treaties of the EU are signed by member states and form the basis of the EU's constitutional structure. The Court of Justice handles EU cases.

I should create questions that are relevant to this context. Let me think about key points:

1. What is the purpose of EU law?
2. How do member states join the EU?
3. Why does the EU exist? (Does it promote social justice?)
4. Are there any issues with EU membership? Maybe economic challenges or environmental concerns.
5. The Treaties are signed by whom? Member states in order, I think.
6. Who regulates EU law? The Court of Justice.
7. How is EU law interpreted?
8. What happens if a member state leaves the EU? Is there a process for that?
9. Does the EU promote environmental protection? (The text mentions environment)
10. How does the EU ensure full employment? Economic stability and job creation.

Let me structure each question with one or two sentences, ensuring they relate to the provided context.

Now, I'll write them out in a CSV format as per instructions.
