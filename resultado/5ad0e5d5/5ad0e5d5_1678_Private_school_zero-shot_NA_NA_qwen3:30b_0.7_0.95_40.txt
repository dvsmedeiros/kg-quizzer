Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs in Portuguese based on the given context about private schools. Let me start by understanding the context thoroughly.

The context explains that a private school is not administered or funded by the government, unlike public schools. They are not dependent on government financing, and unless privately owned, they have a board of governors and a governance system for independent operation.

First, I'll identify key points from the context:
1. Definition of a private school (not government-funded/administered).
2. Contrast with public schools.
3. Financial independence from government.
4. Governance structure (board of governors, independent operation).

Now, I need to formulate questions that target these points. Each question should be in Portuguese, and the answers should be concise, up to 10 words. Let's brainstorm possible questions:

1. What is a private school? (Definition)
2. How does a private school differ from a public school? (Contrast)
3. What is the financial source for private schools? (Funding)
4. What ensures the independence of a private school? (Governance)
5. Who manages a private school? (Board of governors)
6. What is the main characteristic of a private school? (Independence)
7. How are private schools funded? (Government vs. private)
8. What is the role of the board of governors? (Governance)
9. Why are private schools independent? (Financial and governance)
10. What is the key feature of private schools' operation? (Independent operation)

Now, check if each answer is within 10 words and accurate. For example, the answer to "What is a private school?" should be "Escola não administrada ou financiada pelo governo." That's 6 words, good.

Another example: "How does a private school differ from a public school?" Answer: "Não é administrada ou financiada pelo governo." Also 6 words.

I need to ensure that all answers are correct based on the context. Also, avoid repeating the same structure. Maybe vary the questions to cover different aspects: definition, funding, governance, comparison, structure, etc.

Check for any possible inaccuracies. For instance, the context mentions "board of governors" and "system of governance," so questions about that should be addressed.

Make sure each pair is unique and covers different parts of the context. Let me list them out properly, ensuring the CSV format with semicolons and no markdown.
