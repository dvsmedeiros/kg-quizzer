Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format, using the provided context and facts. First, I need to understand the context given. The abstract defines imperialism as a state policy involving expansion through territorial acquisition or political/economic control, using both hard and soft power. It's distinct from colonialism and empire but can apply to other forms of expansion.

Now, looking at the facts from the triples. There's a lot of data here, but I need to extract relevant info. For example, some entries mention ideologies related to imperialism, like the Alliance for National Reconstruction and the Conservative Party of Canada (1867–1942). Also, there are references to books and authors who have written about imperialism, such as "Culture and Imperialism" by Edward Said, and scholars like Wolfgang Mommsen.

I need to create varied questions that cover different aspects of imperialism. Let's start with the definition. A question could be about the main goal of imperialism, which the context mentions as extending power and dominion. The answer would be something like "expansão do poder e domínio."

Next, considering the methods: the context talks about hard power (economic and military) and soft power (cultural and diplomatic). A question here could ask about the two types of power used, with the answer being "poder econômico e militar; poder cultural e diplomático."

Looking at the examples in the triples, there's mention of formal imperialism, like colonial domination. A question could ask what formal imperialism involves, with the answer being "domínio colonial ou ocupação física de territórios."

Another point is the distinction from colonialism. The context says imperialism is a distinct concept, so a question might ask how it differs, with the answer being "aplica-se a outras formas de expansão além do colonialismo."

There's also the mention of books and authors. For example, "Culture and Imperialism" is listed, so a question could be about an example of a book on imperialism, with the answer being "Culture and Imperialism."

The triples also include entries about motives, like the Circassian genocide having imperialism as a motive. A question here could be about historical events linked to imperialism, with the answer being "genocídio Circasso."

I need to ensure that each question is unique and covers different aspects. Let me check for repetition and ensure answers are derived directly from the context or triples. Also, the answers should be concise, under 10 words. Let me list out the possible questions and answers now, making sure they are varied and based on the provided information.
