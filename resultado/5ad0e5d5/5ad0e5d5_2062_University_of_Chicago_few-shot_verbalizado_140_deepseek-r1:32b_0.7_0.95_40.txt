Alright, I need to generate a CSV with 10 question-answer pairs based on the given context about the University of Chicago. Let me start by understanding the content and identifying key points.

First, the university is private and located in Chicago's Hyde Park. It has an undergraduate college and five graduate divisions. There are eight professional schools listed, including Law, Business, Medicine, etc. They have additional campuses in several cities worldwide. Scholars there contributed to many academic fields, developed the Chicago Schools, and were involved in significant scientific achievements like the first self-sustaining nuclear reaction under Stagg Field.

Looking at the facts, notable alumni include Nobel laureates, Fields Medalists, Turing Award winners, etc. The university press is the largest in the US, and they administer Fermi and Argonne National Labs.

Now, I should create varied questions covering different aspects: location, number of students, schools, achievements, notable individuals, research facilities, etc. Each question must have a single correct answer from the context or inferable facts.

I'll start drafting questions:

1. Location? Hyde Park.
2. Number of students? 18,452.
3. Professional schools count? Eight.
4. First nuclear reaction location? Stagg Field's stands.
5. University press size? Largest in the US.
6. Affiliated labs? Fermi and Argonne.
7. Connection to Chicago Schools? Developed them.
8. Notable achievements? Radiocarbon dating revolution.
9. Nobel laureates count? 97.
10. Fields Medalists? 10.

I need to ensure each question is unique and covers different areas without repetition. I'll check if all answers are within the provided context or can be inferred correctly. Once satisfied, I'll format them into CSV with semicolon separators as required.
