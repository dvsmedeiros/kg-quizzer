Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the provided context about Ctenophora. The separator is a semicolon, and each answer should be concise, up to 10 words. 

First, I need to parse the context thoroughly. The main points are: Ctenophora are marine invertebrates, also known as comb jellies, characterized by their cilia used for swimming (called combs), their size range, the number of validated species, their body structure, and their role as predators. Also, there's info on their fossil history and the debate about their position in the tree of life.

Looking at the example provided, the questions are varied, covering different aspects like definition, characteristics, size, species count, body structure, etc. I need to ensure that each question is unique and covers different parts of the context without repetition.

Let me start by listing possible questions. For example, "Qual o nome comum dos Ctenophora?" would be "geleias de pente". Then, their size range, which mentions up to 1.5m. The number of species is between 100-150 with possible 25 more. Their body structure includes a jelly mass with two-cell layers. Predatory role is another point. The etymology from Greek, their habitat (marine), and the debate on their phylogenetic position.

Wait, the context also mentions fossils dating back to the Cambrian period. That's a good point for a question. Also, the different body forms like cydippids, platyctenids, and beroids. The exception in their predatory behavior (juveniles being parasites). 

I need to make sure the answers are directly from the text or can be inferred. For instance, "O que são comumente conhecidos como ctenophora?" answer is "geleias de pente". The size is up to 1.5 m. The number of species is 100-150 validated, with 25 possibly unnamed. The body structure: jelly mass with two-cell layers. Predators except two species' juveniles. Fossils from Cambrian. The debate about their phylogenetic position. 

I need to avoid repeating questions. Let me check for each point. Also, ensure answers are concise. For example, the etymology question: "O que significa ctenophora em grego?" answer is "κτείς kteis 'comb' e φέρω pherō 'carry'". 

Another point is their swimming method using cilia called combs. The different body forms: egg-shaped, flat, large-mouthed. Their role as predators, and the exception. 

Let me compile the questions now, making sure each is unique and covers different aspects. Then format them correctly with semicolons and check for the 10-word limit on answers. Avoid any markdown, just the CSV as specified.
