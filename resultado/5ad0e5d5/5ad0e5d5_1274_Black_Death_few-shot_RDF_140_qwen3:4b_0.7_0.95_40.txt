Okay, the user wants me to generate 10 CSV pairs of questions and answers related to the Black Death based on the provided context. Let me start by understanding the context thoroughly.

The Black Death was a pandemic from 1346 to 1353, causing massive deaths. The text mentions it originated in Central or East Asia, spread via Genoese ships, and had different forms like bubonic, pneumonic. The death toll is between 75-200 million, with 30-60% in Europe. It had religious, social, and economic impacts. The origin is disputed, with some evidence pointing to Kyrgyzstan in the 1330s. There were further outbreaks until the 19th century.

I need to create varied questions that cover different aspects: origin, spread, causes, effects, death toll, duration, etc. Each question must have a unique and correct answer, all in Portuguese. The answers should be concise, under 10 words. Let me list possible questions:

1. Origin of the Black Death: Central or East Asia.
2. How it spread to Europe: via Genoese ships with rats.
3. Death toll in Europe: 30-60%.
4. When did it peak in Europe: 1347-1351.
5. What caused it: Yersinia pestis via fleas and person-to-person contact.
6. When did the population recover: 16th century.
7. How did it spread in Europe: pneumonic plague, leading to quick inland spread.
8. Where did it originate: Central Asia or East Asia.
9. When did the first surge in Kyrgyzstan happen: late 1330s.
10. What was the main impact: economic and social upheavals.

Wait, but the example given in the prompt includes questions like "De onde se originou a morte negra?" and "Como a morte negra chegou ao Mediterrâneo e à Europa?" So I need to make sure the questions are in Portuguese, and the answers are short.

Let me check if each answer is within the context. For example, the origin is disputed, but the text says it originated either in Central or East Asia. The spread to Europe was via Genoese ships with rats. The death toll in Europe is 30-60%. The peak in Europe was 1347-1351. The cause is Yersinia pestis, spread by fleas and person-to-person. The population recovery was in the 16th century. The spread in Europe was pneumonic, leading to quick spread. The first surge in Kyrgyzstan was late 1330s. The main impact is economic and social.

I need to make sure each question is unique and covers different aspects. Let me count: that's 10 points. Now, translate these into Portuguese, ensuring the answers are correct and concise. Avoid any markdown, just the CSV format. Also, check for any possible overlaps or inaccuracies. For example, the text mentions "the seventh year after it began, it came to England" but the main answer is about the spread via ships. The answer for the origin is Central or East Asia. The answer for the first surge in Kyrgyzstan is late 1330s. The answer for the cause is Yersinia pestis. The answer for the impact is economic and social upheavals. The answer for the peak in Europe is 1347-1351. The answer for the death toll in Europe is 30-60%. The answer for the spread method is via Genoese ships with rats. The answer for the population recovery is 16th century. The answer for the main cause is Yersinia pestis. The answer for the spread in Europe is pneumonic plague. 

I think that's all. Now, format them into CSV with each line as "question,answer".
