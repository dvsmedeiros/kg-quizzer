Okay, I need to generate a CSV file with 10 pairs of questions and answers related to the French and Indian War (1754–1763). The user provided some context and facts that should help me create accurate and relevant questions.

First, I'll start by reading through the abstract and triplas to understand the key events and figures. The main points are the conflict's causes, major battles, key participants, outcomes, and aftermath.

I need to make sure each question is distinct and covers different aspects of the war so that they don't overlap too much. Also, the answers should be concise and directly supported by the provided information.

Let me list out possible topics:
1. Causes of the war.
2. Battles and their locations or outcomes.
3. Key leaders and their roles.
4. Impact on indigenous populations.
5. Treaties resulting from the war.

Now, I'll draft each question based on these topics, ensuring they are clear and answerable with a single-word or short phrase answer as per the example.

I should also cross-check to make sure I'm using correct dates and names mentioned in the context, like Braddock, Washington, etc.

After drafting all 10 pairs, I'll format them into CSV, making sure each question and answer are separated by a comma and enclosed within quotes.
