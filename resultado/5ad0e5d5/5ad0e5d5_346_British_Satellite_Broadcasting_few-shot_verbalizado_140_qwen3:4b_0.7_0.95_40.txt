Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the given context. Let me start by understanding the context provided. The main information is about British Satellite Broadcasting (BSB), a company based in London that provided direct broadcast satellite services to the UK. It started in 1990 and was merged with Sky Television in 1990 to form BSkyB. The facts mention various categories, types, and related entities like TV channels owned by BSB, its location, founding year, and merged company.

First, I should ensure that the questions are varied and cover different aspects of the information. The answers need to be concise, up to 10 words, and directly derived from the context. I need to avoid repeating similar questions. Let's go through the facts to find possible questions.

Looking at the facts, there are mentions of the company's type (like SocialGroup107950920, Company, etc.), its location (London, England, Marco Polo House), founding year (1986), merger with Sky, categories (British companies established in 1986, etc.), and TV channels owned by BSB (The Computer Channel, Now, The Power Station, Galaxy, The Movie Channel, etc.).

Possible questions could be about the company's type, location, founding year, merger details, associated TV channels, categories, and other related entities. Let me list out possible questions and their answers.

1. What is the type of British Satellite Broadcasting? (Answer: Company)
2. Where is British Satellite Broadcasting located? (Answer: London)
3. When was British Satellite Broadcasting founded? (Answer: 1986)
4. Which company did British Satellite Broadcasting merge with? (Answer: Sky Television plc)
5. What is the main category of British Satellite Broadcasting? (Answer: British companies established in 1986)
6. What is the name of the TV channel owned by BSB? (Answer: The Computer Channel)
7. What is the destination of British Satellite Broadcasting after merging? (Answer: BSkyB)
8. What is the main location of British Satellite Broadcasting? (Answer: Marco Polo House)
9. What is the year of the merger? (Answer: 1990)
10. What is the type of the company according to the facts? (Answer: Organization)

Wait, but I need to check if these answers are present in the context. Let me verify each one.

For the first question, the facts mention "British Satellite Broadcasting é do tipo Company", so that's correct. The location is "localizado em London", so that's correct. Founded in 1986 is mentioned as "foi fundado em 1986-12-11". The merger with Sky is mentioned as "teve como destino Merged with Sky Television plcto form BSkyB". The main category is "Category:British companies established in 1986". A TV channel example is "The Computer Channel (BSB) é de propriedade da empresa British Satellite Broadcasting". The destination after merging is BSkyB. The merger year is 1990. The type is "Company".

I need to ensure that each answer is within 10 words. Let me check the word count. For example, "Company" is one word. "London" is one word. "1986" is one word. "Sky Television plc" is four words, but the answer should be short. Wait, the answer needs to be short. Maybe "Sky Television plc" is acceptable as the answer for the merger partner. But according to the facts, the merger was with Sky Television plc to form BSkyB. So the answer for the merger partner is "Sky Television plc". However, the answer should be concise. Alternatively, "Sky Television plc" is the correct answer.

Wait, the user said the answer should be short, up to 10 words. So "Sky Television plc" is acceptable. Similarly, "BSkyB" is the destination. So those are okay.

Another possible question is about the location. The facts say "localizado em London" and "localizado em England" and "Marco Polo House". So the answer could be "London" or "Marco Polo House". But the main location is London. So the answer for "Where is British Satellite Broadcasting located?" is "London".

I think that's all. Let me structure these into 10 questions, ensuring they are distinct and cover different aspects of the information.
