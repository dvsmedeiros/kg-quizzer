Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the provided context and facts about the IPCC. Let me start by understanding the context and facts given.

First, the context talks about the IPCC being an intergovernmental body of the United Nations, established by WMO and UNEP in 1988. It has 195 member states, a secretariat in Geneva, and three working groups. The IPCC's role is to assess scientific literature on climate change, including impacts and response options, without conducting original research. They produce Assessment Reports and have been involved in major agreements like the Paris Agreement. The sixth assessment cycle is ongoing, with reports released in 2021-2023. They also share the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize with Al Gore.

Now, looking at the facts, there are a lot of details about the IPCC's structure, members, reports, and key figures. Some entries mention the headquarters in Geneva, the secretariat hosted by WMO, the three working groups, the Nobel Prize, the sixth assessment cycle, and specific reports like the Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C. Also, there are mentions of individuals like Rajendra K. Pachauri, Hoesung Lee, and others associated with the IPCC.

I need to create 10 varied questions. Let me brainstorm possible questions. 

1. What is the full name of the organization abbreviated as IPCC?
2. Which organizations established the IPCC?
3. Where is the IPCC's secretariat located?
4. What is the main role of the IPCC?
5. Which Nobel Prize did the IPCC share in 2007?
6. What is the current assessment cycle of the IPCC?
7. Which body does the IPCC belong to?
8. Who is the current president of the IPCC?
9. What is the primary focus of the IPCC's Assessment Reports?
10. When was the IPCC established?

Wait, some of these might overlap. Let me check the facts again. The context says the IPCC is part of the UN, established by WMO and UNEP in 1988. The secretariat is in Geneva hosted by WMO. The main role is to assess scientific literature. The 2007 Nobel Prize is mentioned. The sixth assessment cycle started in 2015, ending in 2023. The current president is Hoesung Lee. The Assessment Reports focus on climate change impacts, risks, and response options. 

I need to ensure each question is unique and covers different aspects. Also, the answers must be concise, up to 10 words. Let me structure the CSV accordingly, making sure to use semicolons and Portuguese. Let me verify each question and answer against the context and facts to ensure accuracy.
