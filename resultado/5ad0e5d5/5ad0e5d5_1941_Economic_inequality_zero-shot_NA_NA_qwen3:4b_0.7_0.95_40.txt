Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs in CSV format based on the provided context. Let me start by understanding the context thoroughly.

The context talks about economic inequality, covering income, wealth, and consumption. It mentions the Gini coefficient, Inequality-adjusted Human Development Index, and concepts like equity, equality of outcome, and opportunity. It also discusses globalization's impact on inequality between and within countries, the peak of income inequality in the 1970s, convergence of income levels, and the effects of inequality on growth and stability.

First, I should identify key concepts and facts from the text. For each question, I need to make sure it's relevant and the answer is a short phrase (up to 10 words). Let me list possible questions:

1. What are the main measures of economic inequality?
2. What is the Gini coefficient used for?
3. What does the Inequality-adjusted Human Development Index include?
4. What are the key concepts of equality mentioned?
5. How has globalization affected global and national inequality?
6. When did income inequality between nations peak?
7. What is the trend in income levels across countries since the 1970s?
8. What has happened to inequality within most nations in the last 30 years?
9. What are the main effects of economic inequality according to research?
10. What percentage of advanced economies have seen increased income inequality?

Now, I need to ensure each answer is concise. For example, the answer to the first question would be "Income and wealth distribution." The Gini coefficient is for measuring income inequality. The Inequality-adjusted Human Development Index includes inequality factors. Key concepts include equity, equality of outcome, and opportunity. Globalization reduced global inequality but increased within-nation inequality. Income inequality peaked in the 1970s. Income levels have converged, with most in middle-income countries. Inequality within nations has risen, especially in advanced countries. Research links inequality to political instability, democratic breakdown, and civil conflict. 90% of advanced economies have seen increased inequality.

I need to check that each answer is under 10 words. Let me count:

1. Income and wealth distribution. (6 words)
2. Measures income inequality. (5 words)
3. Takes inequality into account. (5 words)
4. Equity, outcome, opportunity. (6 words)
5. Reduced global, increased within. (6 words)
6. 1970s. (1 word)
7. Converged to middle-income. (5 words)
8. Risen significantly, especially in advanced. (7 words)
9. Political instability, democratic breakdown, conflict. (9 words)
10. 90% of advanced economies. (6 words)

Yes, all answers are under 10 words. Now, I'll format them as CSV pairs, making sure to separate each with a semicolon and no extra text. The final output should be the 10 lines as specified.
