Okay, so I need to generate 10 question-response pairs in CSV format about the University of Chicago based on the provided context and facts. The questions should be varied and cover different aspects like its structure, history, notable people, achievements, etc. Each response must be short and correct, derived from the given information.

First, I'll review the abstract and the triples to extract key points. The University of Chicago is a private research university in Hyde Park, founded in 1890. It has an undergraduate college, five graduate divisions, and eight professional schools. Notable alumni and faculty include Nobel laureates like James Heckman and Eric Maskin.

Looking at the facts section, I see many individuals associated with UChicago, both as alumni and employees. The university also has campuses in other cities and is known for its role in nuclear research, particularly the Manhattan Project under Enrico Fermi.

Now, I'll brainstorm possible questions:

1. What type of university is the University of Chicago? (public or private)
2. When was it founded?
3. How many professional schools does it have?
4. Where is the main campus located?
5. Which school is the largest university press in the US?
6. Name a Nobel laureate associated with UChicago.
7. What significant scientific achievement occurred under Stagg Field?
8. How many graduate divisions does it have?
9. In what year did the first self-sustaining nuclear reaction occur there?
10. Where are some of its additional campuses located?

Now, I'll structure these into questions and find the correct answers from the context.

I need to ensure that each question is unique and covers different areas without repetition. Also, responses should be concise, within 10 words.
