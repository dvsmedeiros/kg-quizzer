Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs based on the provided data about Jacksonville, Florida. Let me start by understanding the data.

The data includes various entities with properties. For example, there's a mention of the population density being 490.63 per km², population rank as 12, and population metro of 1,733,937. Also, there are entries about the Port of Jacksonville, St. John's Cathedral, and other landmarks.

First, I should identify key facts that can form questions. Let me list out the main categories: population statistics, geographical features, notable landmarks, cultural aspects, and maybe some historical or administrative info.

Looking at the population data: population density, metro population, rank. That could lead to questions like "What is the population density of Jacksonville, Florida?" or "What is the population of the Jacksonville metro area?"

Geographical features include the Port of Jacksonville, Yellow Bluff Fort, Pumpkin Hill Creek Preserve, and Tree Hill Nature Center. These can be used for questions about nearby parks, ports, or natural areas.

Notable landmarks: St. John's Cathedral, KBJ Architects, Providence School, etc. Questions could be about the location of these landmarks or their significance.

Cultural aspects: The nickname "The River City," the term "Jax," and the mention of Lynyrd Skynyrd as a hometown. Maybe a question about the city's nicknames or local music groups.

Administrative info: The United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit has a duty station here. That's a good fact for a question.

I need to make sure each question is clear and the answer is directly from the data. Let me check for any other facts. There's info about the climate, like February low temperature and June precipitation. That could be another question about climate data.

Also, the Port of Jacksonville is mentioned, so a question about its location or significance. The New World Publications headquarters is in Jacksonville, so that's another point.

I should ensure that the questions are varied and cover different aspects. Let me start drafting the pairs:

1. Population density question.
2. Metro population question.
3. Nickname question.
4. Climate data (February low).
5. Port location.
6. St. John's Cathedral location.
7. United States Court of Appeals duty station.
8. Lynyrd Skynyrd's hometown.
9. Population rank.
10. Tree Hill Nature Center location.

Wait, I need to make sure each answer is accurate based on the data provided. Let me verify each point. For example, the population rank is 12, so the answer should state that. The port is in Jacksonville, so the answer is "Jacksonville, Florida." The climate data includes febLowF as 46.1, so the answer would be 46.1°F. 

I need to make sure the questions are phrased correctly and the answers are concise. Also, avoid repeating the same type of questions. Let me check if I have 10 unique pairs. Yes, that seems to cover different aspects. I'll format them as per the instructions, using the specified syntax.
