Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs based on the provided context and facts about Victoria, Australia. Let me start by carefully reading through the context and the facts to identify key points that can form the basis of the questions.

First, the context gives information about Victoria's geography, history, population, government, economy, and cultural aspects. The facts list various locations, people, and organizations associated with Victoria. I need to ensure that the questions are varied and cover different aspects of the content, without repeating similar ones.

Looking at the context, some key points are:
- Victoria is the smallest state in Australia by area but the second most populous.
- Melbourne is the capital and the second-largest city.
- Historical aspects: established as a colony in 1851, gold rush in the 1850s-60s, became a federal capital until 1927.
- Government structure: 38 seats in the House of Representatives, 12 in the Senate; state parliament consists of Legislative Assembly and Legislative Council.
- Current leadership: Daniel Andrews as Premier, Linda Dessau as Governor.
- Economy: diversified, second-highest GDP in Australia, but sixth in GDP per capita.
- Cultural aspects: Melbourne's sporting venues, universities, and events like the Australian Open and AFL Grand Final.

From the facts, there are mentions of specific places (African Safari World, Wallagaraugh River, Mount Feathertop), people (Peter Nugent, Dianne Cook), organizations (Transport Ticketing Authority, Islamic Information and Services Network), and other details (lowest temperature recorded, postal codes, universities, etc.).

Now, I need to create 10 questions that are relevant, varied, and have answers directly from the context or facts. Let's brainstorm possible questions:

1. What is the capital of Victoria?
2. In which year was Victoria officially established as a colony?
3. What is the name of the current Governor of Victoria?
4. Which city is known as the sporting capital of the world?
5. What is Victoria's rank in terms of GDP per capita in Australia?
6. What is the name of the largest stadium in Australia?
7. Which river's mouth is located in Victoria?
8. What is the lowest temperature ever recorded in Victoria in February?
9. How many seats does Victoria have in the Australian Senate?
10. What is the name of the university where Farrer Hall is located?

Now, checking if these questions are covered in the context and facts. The capital is Melbourne. Established in 1851. Governor is Linda Dessau. Melbourne is the sporting capital. GDP per capita is sixth. Largest stadium is Melbourne Cricket Ground (though the context mentions the AFL Grand Final at the MCG, but the name isn't explicitly stated). The river with the mouth in Victoria is Wallagaraugh River. Lowest temperature in February is -3.8°C (from the fact list). Victoria has 12 Senate seats. Farrer Hall is at Monash University.

Wait, the context mentions the MCG as the venue for the AFL Grand Final, but the name isn't given. However, in the facts, there's a mention of Melbourne Convention and Exhibition Centre, but that's not the largest stadium. Maybe the answer for the largest stadium is Melbourne Cricket Ground, but the context doesn't explicitly state that. Hmm, need to check again.

Looking back at the context: "the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG) is the venue for the AFL Grand Final." So that's a valid answer. But the context doesn't say "largest stadium in Australia," but the fact that it's the venue for the AFL Grand Final might be enough for the question. However, the user's example had a question about the largest stadium, and the answer was left as a placeholder. Maybe the user expects the answer to be Melbourne Cricket Ground, even if not explicitly stated. Alternatively, the fact list mentions "Melbourne Convention and Exhibition Centre" but that's a convention center, not a stadium. So perhaps the answer is the MCG, even if not explicitly stated. Alternatively, the fact list might have another entry. Wait, in the facts, there's "Melbourne Convention and Exhibition Centre está localizado em Victoria (Australia)" but that's a convention center. The largest stadium in Australia is the Sydney Olympic Park Stadium, but that's in New South Wales. Wait, no, the largest stadium in Australia is the Melbourne Cricket Ground. I think that's a commonly known fact. Even if the context doesn't explicitly state that, the user might expect that as the answer. However, to be precise, the context only mentions that the MCG is where the AFL Grand Final is held, not that it's the largest stadium. But since the user included an example with a question about the largest stadium and the answer was left as a placeholder, maybe the answer is the MCG, assuming that's the correct one. Alternatively, the answer might be the Docklands Stadium or something else. Hmm, this is a bit tricky. Maybe the user expects the answer to be the MCG based on the context.

Another point: the lowest temperature recorded in Victoria in February is -3.8°C, which is from the fact list ("Victoria (Australia) possui imagem representativa Victoria rainfall.jpg" doesn't mention temperature, but in the fact list, there's a mention of "-3.8°C" in the facts? Wait, looking back at the facts provided, there's a line that says "Victoria (Australia) possui imagem representativa Victoria rainfall.jpg" but no temperature. Wait, maybe I missed that. Let me check again.

Wait, the user provided a list of facts. Let me scan through them again. Oh, there's a fact that says "Victoria (Australia) possui imagem representativa Victoria rainfall.jpg" but no temperature. Wait, the user's example had a question about the lowest temperature in February, but the answer wasn't filled in. Maybe that's a mistake. Wait, looking back, in the user's example, the fifth question was "Qual é o maior estádio da Austrália?" with the answer left as a dot. So maybe the user expects the assistant to use the provided context and facts to answer, even if some details are not explicitly stated. However, in the context, the MCG is mentioned as the venue for the AFL Grand Final, which is a major event, but the largest stadium in Australia might be the Sydney Olympic Park Stadium. However, that's in NSW. So perhaps the answer is the MCG, even if not explicitly stated. Alternatively, the answer might be the Melbourne Cricket Ground. Given that the context mentions the MCG for the AFL Grand Final, and the user's example had a similar question, I think that's acceptable.

Another point: the river's mouth is in Victoria. The fact list mentions "Wallagaraugh River (Victoria) tem nome de subdivisão Victoria (Australia)", but the mouth is mentioned in the context as "Wallagaraugh River's mouth is located in Victoria." So that's a valid question.

So, compiling the questions and answers based on the context and facts:

1. What is the capital of Victoria?
   - Answer: Melbourne

2. In which year was Victoria officially established as a colony?
   - Answer: 1851

3. What is the name of the current Governor of Victoria?
   - Answer: Linda Dessau

4. Which city is known as the sporting capital of the world?
   - Answer: Melbourne

5. What is Victoria's rank in terms of GDP per capita in Australia?

   - Answer: Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG)

7. Which river's mouth is located in Victoria?
   - Answer: Wallagaraugh River

8. What is the lowest temperature ever recorded in Victoria in February?
   - Answer: -3.8°C (assuming this is from the fact list, but in the provided facts, I don't see this. Wait, the user's example had a question about the lowest temperature in February, but the answer wasn't filled. However, in the fact list, there's a line: "Victoria (Australia) possui imagem representativa Victoria rainfall.jpg" but no temperature. Wait, maybe the user made a mistake here. Alternatively, the answer might be -3.8°C, which is a commonly known fact, even if not explicitly stated. But since the context doesn't mention it, I should avoid that. Maybe that question is not valid. Let me check again.

Looking back at the fact list, I don't see any mention of the lowest temperature in Victoria. The user's example had a question about that, but the answer wasn't provided. Maybe that's an error. Alternatively, the user expects the assistant to use the context, which doesn't mention that temperature. So perhaps that question is not valid. Maybe I should skip that and pick another fact.
