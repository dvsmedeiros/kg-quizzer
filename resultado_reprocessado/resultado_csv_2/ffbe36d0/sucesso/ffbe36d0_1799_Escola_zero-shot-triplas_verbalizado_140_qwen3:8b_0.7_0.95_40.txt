Okay, the user wants me to generate 10 question-answer pairs based on the provided context and facts. Let me start by understanding the context. The main topic is about schools, their definitions, and various examples of private schools from different regions. 

First, I need to make sure each question is unique and covers different aspects. The context mentions the historical meaning of "school" and the modern structure with different educational levels. The facts list a lot of private schools, so maybe some questions can be about identifying the type of school or specific examples.

Wait, the user specified that the answers must be directly from the content. So I need to check each fact to see if there's a specific detail that can form a question. For example, some schools are mentioned with their type as private, so a question could ask about the type of a specific school.

Let me go through the facts again. There are many entries, like "KGiSL Institute of Technology é um(a) Private school" and others. So a question could be "Qual é o tipo de escola da KGiSL Institute of Technology?" with the answer "Private school".

I need to ensure that each question is distinct. Maybe some questions can be about the structure of education systems, like the levels (fundamental, médio, superior), or the purpose of schools. Also, the context mentions that most countries have formal education systems that are mandatory, so a question could ask about the structure of these systems.

But I have to generate exactly 10 pairs. Let me list possible questions:

1. What is the type of school for KGiSL Institute of Technology?
2. What is the term for a school that provides higher education?
3. Which educational level is for children?
4. What is the term for a school that offers higher education?
5. What is the purpose of a school according to the text?
6. What is the name of a school that is a private institution in the Philippines?
7. Which school is located in the United States?
8. What is the term for a school that is not public?
9. What is the name of a school in India that is a private institution?
10. What is the name of a school in the United Kingdom?

Wait, some of these might not be accurate. Let me check the facts again. For example, "St. Mary's College of Quezon City é um(a) Private school" is in the Philippines. "Catholic High School for Boys (Little Rock, Arkansas)" is in the US. "St. Andrews School (India)" is in India. "Lycée français de Bakou" is in Azerbaijan, but the user might consider it part of the UK context. Also, "The British School, Kathmandu" is in Nepal. Hmm, but the user might have different regions in mind. 

I need to make sure that the answers are directly from the facts provided. Let me verify each fact to form the questions. For example, "The Lamplighter School" is a private school, so a question could be "Which school is a private institution in the United States?" with the answer being "The Lamplighter School".

Wait, but the user might want more variety. Maybe some questions about the structure of education systems, like the levels. The context mentions that in most countries, the system is mandatory with levels like fundamental and médio. So a question could be "Which educational level is for children according to the text?" with the answer "Ensino fundamental".

Also, the context states that a school for higher education is called a university or college. So a question could be "What is the term for a school that provides higher education?" with the answer "Faculdade ou universidade".

I need to ensure that each question is unique and covers different aspects. Let me compile the 10 pairs now, making sure they are all correct and based on the provided content.
