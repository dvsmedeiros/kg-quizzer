Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs based on the context provided, which is "Islamismo_político". The user wants them in Portuguese, in a JSON format with each pair having a "pergunta" and "resposta". Let me start by understanding what "Islamismo_político" refers to. It's about the political aspects of Islam, so topics might include the role of religion in governance, different political movements within Islam, historical examples, and maybe current issues.

First, I should list out key points related to political Islam. For example, concepts like Sharia law, the role of religious leaders in politics, movements such as the Muslim Brotherhood, the differences between various Islamic political ideologies (like secular vs. theocratic), and maybe examples of countries where Islam plays a significant role in governance, such as Iran or Saudi Arabia.

Now, I need to form questions that cover different aspects. Let's start with definitions: "What is the term used to describe the political application of Islamic principles?" The answer would be "Islamismo_político" or "Political Islam". But the user might prefer the Portuguese term, so maybe "Islamismo_político" is the answer here.

Another angle could be the role of Sharia in political systems. A question like "What legal system is a cornerstone in some Islamic political systems?" The answer would be Sharia law. Then, I should ensure that each question is distinct and covers different areas—maybe some on historical contexts, others on modern examples, ideologies, and key figures or organizations.

I need to avoid repetition. So, after the first few questions on definitions and core concepts, I can move to specific movements like the Muslim Brotherhood, the role of the Caliphate, and the difference between Sunni and Shia political structures. Also, mentioning countries where political Islam is prominent, such as Iran's theocracy, Saudi Arabia's monarchy, and maybe the influence in countries like Egypt or Turkey.

I should check that each answer is directly supported by the context. Since the context is "Islamismo_político", I can infer that the answers should be factual and based on common knowledge related to that topic. For example, the Muslim Brotherhood is a key organization, so a question about that would have that as an answer. The Caliphate's historical role in governance is another point.

Also, considering the user's instructions, the questions must be varied. So I can ask about the main objectives of political Islamic groups, the influence of religious leaders in certain countries, the differences between secular and theocratic Islamic states, and the role of Islamic law in governance.

I need to make sure that each answer is unique and not overlapping with another. Let me count to 10, ensuring each question is different and covers a unique aspect. Once I have all 10, I'll format them into the JSON structure as specified, without any additional text or explanations.
