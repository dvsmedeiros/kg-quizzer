Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs based on the provided context and facts. Let's start by reading through the context and facts carefully.

The context talks about Victoria, Australia, its geography, history, government, economy, and cultural aspects. The facts list various locations, people, and institutions associated with Victoria. 

First, I should identify key points from the context. For example, Victoria is the smallest state in Australia, has Melbourne as its capital, was part of New South Wales, etc. Then, from the facts, there are specific details like the lowest temperature record, locations of places like the Melbourne Cricket Ground, universities, and notable people born or deceased there.

I need to make sure each question is different and covers various aspects. Let's start with the capital city. The context says Melbourne is the capital, so a question about that. Then, the population density. The context mentions it's the most densely populated state. 

Next, the gold rush in the 1850s and 1860s. The context states that it significantly increased population and wealth. Also, the fact that Victoria became a self-governing colony in 1855. 

From the facts, there's the lowest temperature record of -3.9°C in February. Then, the universities, like the University of Melbourne established in 1853. 

Other points: the Melbourne Cricket Ground hosting the 1956 Olympics, the Australian Open at Melbourne Park. Also, Victoria's GDP per capita is AU$68,996. 

I should check for repetition. For example, not asking multiple questions about Melbourne's status as a capital. Need to vary the topics. Also, ensure answers are directly from the context or facts. 

Let me list possible questions:

1. What is the capital city of Victoria, Australia?
   Answer: Melbourne.

2. Which event was hosted by the Melbourne Cricket Ground in 1956?
   Answer: The Summer Olympics.

3. What is the lowest temperature recorded in Victoria, Australia?
   Answer: -3.9°C in February.

4. When did Victoria become a self-governing colony?
   Answer: 1855.

5. What is the GDP per capita of Victoria, Australia?
   Answer: AU$68,996.

6. Which university is the oldest in Victoria, Australia?
   Answer: University of Melbourne, established in 1853.

7. What is the name of the stadium that hosts the Australian Open?
   Answer: Melbourne Park.

8. What is the area of Victoria, Australia in square kilometers?
   Answer: 227,444 km².

9. Which event was held in Melbourne in 2006?
   Answer: Commonwealth Games.

10. What is the name of the state's largest city?
    Answer: Melbourne.

Wait, some of these might be overlapping. Let me check again. The context mentions Melbourne was the capital until Canberra was built. Also, the fact that Victoria is the second most populous state after New South Wales. Maybe include that. 

Also, the fact that the gold rush increased population and wealth. Another point: the state has 79 municipal districts. 

Another fact: the first European settlement was in 1803 at Sullivan Bay. 

I need to make sure each question is unique and covers different aspects. Let me revise the list to avoid repetition and ensure variety.
