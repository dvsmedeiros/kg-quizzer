Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs based on the provided context and facts about the French and Indian War. Let me start by reading through the context again to make sure I understand the key points.

The main conflict is between the British and French in their North American colonies from 1754-1763, part of the Seven Years' War. Native American groups like the Algonquins and Hurons allied with the French, while the Iroquois were with the British. The French had strategic positions but the British controlled the Atlantic, leading to the fall of French territories like Louisbourg and Quebec. Key events include the Battle of Minden, the fall of Montreal in 1760, and the involvement of Spain later in the war. 

Now, looking at the facts, there's a lot of information about participants, battles, dates, and key figures. The user wants varied questions that cover different aspects, so I need to make sure each question touches on different elements like dates, key figures, events, alliances, and outcomes.

First question: What was the main conflict between Britain and France in North America? The answer is the French and Indian War.

Second: Which Native American groups allied with the French? Algonquins and Hurons.

Third: When did the French lose control of Louisbourg? 1758.

Fourth: Who was the British Prime Minister who led the war efforts effectively? William Pitt the Elder.

Fifth: Which key battle in 1759 led to the capture of Quebec? The Battle of Quebec.

Sixth: Which event in 1760 marked the end of French control in Canada? The fall of Montreal.

Seventh: What was the name of the alliance between France and Spain? Pact of the Families (Pacto de Família in Portuguese).

Eighth: Which British naval victory in 1759 significantly weakened the French navy? Battle of Lagos.

Ninth: Which Native American group allied with the British? Iroquois.

Tenth: What was the approximate number of casualties in the French and Indian War? 1,500.

I need to check if all answers are directly from the context or inferable. For example, the date of Louisbourg's fall is 1758, mentioned in the context. The pact between France and Spain is called the Pact of the Families. The casualties are stated as 1,500. The answer about the key battle in 1759 is the capture of Quebec, which is mentioned in the context. The British naval victory at Lagos is also mentioned. The Iroquois alliance with the British is in the context. The fall of Montreal in 1760 is stated. William Pitt the Elder is the prime minister mentioned. The answer about the main conflict is the French and Indian War itself. The key Native American groups are Algonquins and Hurons.

I should also ensure that the questions are not repetitive and cover different aspects. Each question here touches on different elements: alliances, key battles, dates, key figures, outcomes, casualties, and the French-Indian alliances. That should meet the requirement of varied questions. Also, all answers are either directly stated or clearly inferable from the context provided.
