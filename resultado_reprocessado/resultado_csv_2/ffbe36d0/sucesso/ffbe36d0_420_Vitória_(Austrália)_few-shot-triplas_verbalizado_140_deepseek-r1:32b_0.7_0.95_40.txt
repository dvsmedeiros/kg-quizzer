Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs based on the provided context and facts about Victoria, Australia. Let me start by carefully reading through both the main context and the additional facts to extract key information.

First, from the context, I know that Victoria is a state in southeastern Australia, it's the smallest mainland state but the second most populous. Melbourne is its capital and the second-largest city in Australia. It has a diverse economy with strong service sectors, and its GDP per capita is AU$68,996.

Looking at the facts section, there are numerous points about Victoria's geography, people, institutions, events, and more. For example, it mentions African Safari World being located there, the lowest temperature recorded, and various individuals born or educated in Victoria.

I should focus on creating varied questions that cover different aspects like economy, geography, education, culture, sports, etc. Each question must have a clear, correct answer based on the provided information.

Let me start by identifying key points:

1. **Economy**: Diversified with strong service sectors; GDP per capita is AU$68,996.
2. **Geography**: Includes places like Mount Feathertop, Curdies River, and specific regions.
3. **Education**: Several universities and colleges are mentioned, including the oldest university.
4. **People**: Many individuals were born or educated in Victoria.
5. **Sports**: Melbourne is a major sports hub with events like the Australian Open.

I'll structure each question to target these areas without repeating similar topics. For example:

- Ask about the lowest temperature recorded (fact from context).
- Inquire about the capital city (from context).
- Mention the oldest university in Victoria.
- Highlight a significant sporting event hosted there.
- Discuss GDP per capita as an economic indicator.

I need to ensure each question is unique and covers different facets. Let me draft them one by one, making sure each has a precise answer from the provided data.

I also notice that some facts are more obscure, like specific individuals or places, but I should include a mix of well-known and less common points to diversify the questions.

Finally, after drafting all 10 pairs, I'll review them to ensure they're varied, each has one correct answer, and none are redundant.
