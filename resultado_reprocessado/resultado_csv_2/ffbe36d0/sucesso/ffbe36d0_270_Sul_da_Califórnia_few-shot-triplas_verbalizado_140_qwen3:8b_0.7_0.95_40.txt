Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs based on the provided context and facts about Southern California. Let me start by understanding the context given. The region is informally called Southern California (SoCal), with no clear boundaries, bordered by the Pacific Ocean to the west, Mexico to the south, and Arizona to the east. The population in 2019 was around 23.8 million.

Now, looking at the facts, there are a lot of details. I need to make sure the questions are varied and cover different aspects without repeating. The examples provided include questions about abbreviations, population, boundaries, and notable facts. 

First, I should check the context for key points. The abbreviation SoCal is mentioned. The population figure for 2019 is 23.8 million. The geographical boundaries: Pacific Ocean west, Mexico south, Arizona east. Also, the area total is 56,505 square miles. 

Looking at the facts, there are mentions of earthquakes like 1987 Whittier Narrows and 2008 Chino Hills. Also, various companies and organizations like Fosselman's Ice Cream, KFI, Metrolink, etc., are located there. People born in Southern California include Jill Barnett, Gregg Fienberg, etc. 

I need to ensure each question is unique and covers different aspects. Let me brainstorm possible questions:

1. What is the informal abbreviation for Southern California? (Answer: SoCal)
2. What is the population of Southern California as of 2019? (Answer: 23.8 million)
3. Which body of water borders Southern California to the west? (Answer: Pacific Ocean)
4. Which country borders Southern California to the south? (Answer: Mexico)
5. What is the total area of Southern California in square miles? (Answer: 56,505)
6. Which earthquake affected Southern California in 1987? (Answer: Whittier Narrows earthquake)
7. Which organization operates in Southern California? (Answer: Metrolink (California))
8. Who was born in Southern California? (Answer: Jill Barnett)
9. Which company serves Southern California? (Answer: Fosselman's Ice Cream Company)
10. What is the name of an image representing Southern California? (Answer: Sdmarina.jpg)

Wait, the examples in the user's message included some questions about regions and subdivisions, but the context here doesn't mention regions. However, the facts list mentions subdivisions like Los Angeles County, San Bernardino County, etc. Maybe I can include questions about those. But the user's examples don't mention those, so maybe stick to the main context.

Another fact is the area total (mi²) 56505. So question 5 can be about that. Also, the 2008 Chino Hills earthquake. Also, the image Sdmarina.jpg is mentioned. 

I need to make sure the answers are directly from the context. Let me verify each point:

- SoCal is the abbreviation. Check.
- Population 2019: 23.8 million. Check.
- Pacific Ocean west. Check.
- Mexico south. Check.
- Area 56,505 square miles. Check.
- 1987 Whittier Narrows earthquake. Check.
- Metrolink is located there. Check.
- Jill Barnett was born there. Check.
- Fosselman's Ice Cream Company serves the region. Check.
- Sdmarina.jpg is an image. Check.

That's 10 questions. Let me make sure they are varied and not repeating. Each question is about a different aspect: abbreviation, population, geography, earthquake, organization, person, company, image, etc. Looks good. Now, format them into JSON as specified.
