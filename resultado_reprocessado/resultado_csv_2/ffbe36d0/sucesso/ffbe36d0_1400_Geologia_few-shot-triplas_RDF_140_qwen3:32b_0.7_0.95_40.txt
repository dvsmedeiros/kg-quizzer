Okay, let's tackle this task. The user provided a list of examples and a set of data about geology, including various resources and triples. My job is to generate 10 question-answer pairs based on the given examples and the data provided.

First, I need to understand the structure of the examples. Each question is about geology, and the answers are concise. The examples cover topics like rock types, the rock cycle, tectonic plates, and specific geological processes. The data includes information about the Geology resource, its properties, and related entities, but some parts might be in Portuguese. However, the user wants the questions and answers in Portuguese, so I need to make sure the content is translated appropriately.

Looking at the examples, the first question is about igneous rocks forming from magma or lava. The answer is straightforward. The second example asks about sedimentary rock transforming into another type, which is metamorphic. The third is about melting rocks forming new magma. So the pattern is to ask about processes, types, and key geological concepts.

Now, I need to use the provided data. The data includes triples like "Geology is a PersonFunction" and mentions templates like Template:Earth. But perhaps more useful are the examples of resources like William Smith, who is a geologist. Also, there's a mention of the rock cycle (rocha ígnea, sedimentar, metamórfica) and tectonic plates, such as the expansion of the ocean floor being discovered in the 1960s.

I need to create 10 pairs. Let's start by listing possible topics from the data:

1. Types of rocks (igneous, sedimentary, metamorphic)
2. Rock cycle processes (melting, cooling, pressure)
3. Tectonic plates and their movement (litosphere, asthenosphere)
4. Key figures in geology (William Smith, etc.)
5. Geological time periods (mentioned in the Geology resource's depiction)
6. Processes like metamorphism (heat and pressure)
7. The discovery of seafloor spreading in the 1960s

I'll need to form questions based on these topics. For example:

- What is the primary process that forms igneous rocks? (answer: cooling and solidification of magma/lava)
- What are the three main types of rocks? (answer: igneous, sedimentary, metamorphic)
- What process transforms sedimentary rocks into metamorphic rocks? (answer: heat and pressure)
- What was the key discovery in the 1960s related to tectonic plates? (answer: seafloor spreading)
- What are the two parts of Earth included in the lithosphere? (answer: crust and upper mantle)
- What is another term for the upper mantle? (answer: asthenosphere)
- How do tectonic plates interact with the mantle? (answer: through convection currents)
- What is the main component of the rock cycle that leads to the formation of new magma? (answer: melting of existing rocks)
- What is the role of heat and pressure in the formation of metamorphic rocks? (answer: changing the mineral content)
- Who is a notable geologist associated with the study of tectonic plates? (answer: William Smith, though he's more known for geological mapping, maybe another example from the data)

Wait, the data mentions William Smith as a geologist, so maybe a question like "Who is known as the father of geology?" with the answer being William Smith. But I need to check if that's accurate. William Smith is known for creating the first geological map, so maybe "father of geological mapping" is more precise.

Also, the data includes "Geology" as a resource with properties like templates used. But maybe that's more about the Wikipedia page structure, not the content for questions.

Another point: the examples mention "expansão do fundo do mar" (seafloor spreading) discovered in the 1960s. So a question like "In which decade was the seafloor spreading hypothesis confirmed?" with answer "1960s."

I need to ensure that the answers are concise and match the examples. Let's structure each question and answer accordingly, using the data provided and the examples as a template.
