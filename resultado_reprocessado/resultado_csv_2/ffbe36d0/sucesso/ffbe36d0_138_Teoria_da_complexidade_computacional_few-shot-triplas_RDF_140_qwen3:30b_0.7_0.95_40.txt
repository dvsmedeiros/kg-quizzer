Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs based on the given context and facts. Let me start by understanding the context provided. The context is about computational complexity theory, which is a branch of theoretical computer science and mathematics. It focuses on classifying computational problems based on their resource usage and exploring the relationships between these classifications. A computational problem is a task solved by a computer, often through mechanical application of mathematical steps like an algorithm.

The facts provided are in RDF format, linking various individuals and resources to computational complexity theory. For example, several researchers are listed as having an academic discipline or known for contributions in this field. There are also classifications and properties of the computational complexity theory page on DBpedia.

Now, the task is to create 10 unique questions and answers. Each question must be relevant to the context, and the answers must be either explicit or inferable from the given information. I need to ensure that the questions cover different aspects of the topic and don't repeat similar ones.

Looking at the examples provided, the questions vary from definitions of the theory, its focus areas, resource measurements, related fields, and specific concepts like problems, algorithms, and classifications. I should follow a similar approach but make sure not to copy the examples exactly.

First, I'll brainstorm possible questions:

1. What is the main focus of computational complexity theory?
   - Answer: Classifying computational problems based on resource usage and exploring relationships between classifications.

2. What is a computational problem?
   - Answer: A task solved by a computer through mechanical application of mathematical steps, like an algorithm.

3. What are the primary resources used to measure complexity?
   - Answer: Time and storage (memory).

4. Which field of computer science analyzes the resource requirements of specific algorithms?
   - Answer: Analysis of algorithms.

5. What is the role of computational complexity theory in practical computing?
   - Answer: To determine the practical limits of what computers can and cannot do.

6. Which researchers are associated with computational complexity theory according to the data?
   - Answer: Christos Papadimitriou, David Shmoys, Georg Gottlob, Irit Dinur, etc.

7. What is the significance of classifying problems by complexity?
   - Answer: To understand their inherent difficulty and relationships.

8. What is the purpose of using mathematical models in computational problems?
   - Answer: To evaluate or quantify the resources needed for a solution.

9. Which categories does the computational complexity theory page belong to?
   - Answer: Categories like "Computational complexity theory" and "Computational fields of study."

10. What is the primary goal of the theory in terms of problem-solving?
    - Answer: To classify problems based on resource usage and explore their relationships.

Wait, I need to check if these answers are explicitly stated or can be inferred. For example, the context mentions that the theory classifies problems by resource usage and explores relationships. The facts list several researchers linked to the theory. The examples mention "time and storage" as the two main resources. The practical role is about determining limits. The categories are mentioned in the facts. 

I need to ensure that each answer is directly from the context or can be logically inferred. For instance, the question about researchers would need to list names from the facts. However, the user's instruction says to generate answers based on the provided context and facts. The facts include names like Christos Papadimitriou, David Shmoys, etc., so that's a valid question.

Another point: the context says that a computational problem is a task solved by a computer via mechanical application of mathematical steps, which is an algorithm. So that's a valid answer.

Also, the examples mention "time and storage" as the two main resources, so that's a correct answer.

I need to make sure that each question is unique and covers different aspects. Let me check the examples again to avoid repetition. The user provided examples include questions about the main focus, classification by difficulty, definition of computational problems, resources, models, complexity classes, practical role, related fields, and analysis of algorithms.

So, to create new ones, I can focus on other aspects like the categories mentioned in the facts (e.g., "Category:Computational complexity theory"), the use of templates in the wiki page, the depiction links, or the hypernyms. However, the user's examples didn't cover those, so maybe stick to the main concepts.

Another angle: the theory's relation to other fields like computability theory. The context mentions that computational complexity is part of theoretical computer science, and the examples mention "analysis of algorithms and computability theory" as related fields. So a question could be about related fields.

Also, the facts mention that the DBpedia page has certain templates and categories, but that might be too specific. However, the user's examples didn't go into that, so maybe avoid that unless necessary.

Another possible question: What is the purpose of the "Complexity classes" page on DBpedia? Answer: To categorize and explain different complexity classes like P, NP, etc. But the context doesn't explicitly mention this, so it might be inferred from the "wikiPageUsesTemplate" entries, but maybe that's stretching it.

Alternatively, the context says that computational complexity theory is a branch of theoretical computer science and mathematics. So a question could be about its interdisciplinary nature.

Another idea: What is the role of mathematical models in computational complexity? Answer: To evaluate the resources required for solving problems.

I need to ensure that all answers are based on the given context and facts. Let me verify each potential question and answer against the context.

For example, the question about the main focus is covered in the first sentence of the context. The definition of a computational problem is also in the context. The two main resources (time and storage) are mentioned in the examples, but the context might not explicitly state that. Wait, the context says "classifying computational problems by difficulty and class of relationship," but the examples mention time and storage. However, the user's examples are provided as references, so maybe it's acceptable to use that as per the examples.

But the user's instruction says to generate based on the provided context and facts. The context mentions "resource usage" but doesn't specify time and storage. However, the examples include that, so maybe it's acceptable as part of the standard knowledge. However, the user's examples might be illustrative, but the actual answer should be from the given context.

Wait, the user's instruction says "based on the context and facts provided." So I need to make sure that the answers are derived from the given text, not external knowledge. Let me check again.

In the context, it says: "classifying computational problems by difficulty and class of relationship" and "measuring the complexity of problems." The example answer for "two main resources" is "time and storage," but the context doesn't explicitly state that. So maybe I need to avoid that and instead look for other aspects.

Hmm, this complicates things. Let me re-express the questions based strictly on the context.

The context says:

- Computational complexity theory is a branch of theoretical computer science and mathematics.
- It focuses on classifying computational problems based on resource usage and exploring relationships between classifications.
- A computational problem is a task that can be solved by a computer via mechanical application of mathematical steps (algorithms).

The facts include:

- Several individuals linked to computational complexity theory.
- The DBpedia page for computational complexity theory has various categories, templates, and images.

So possible questions:

1. What is the primary field of study for computational complexity theory?
   Answer: Theoretical computer science and mathematics.

2. What is the main objective of computational complexity theory?
   Answer: To classify computational problems by resource usage and explore relationships between classifications.

3. What defines a computational problem according to the context?
   Answer: A task that can be solved by a computer through mechanical application of mathematical steps, such as an algorithm.

4. Which researchers are associated with computational complexity theory based on the data?
   Answer: Christos Papadimitriou, David Shmoys, Georg Gottlob, Irit Dinur, and others listed in the facts.

5. What is the role of computational complexity theory in understanding problem-solving?
   Answer: To determine the inherent difficulty of problems and their relationships.

6. What categories does the computational complexity theory page belong to?
   Answer: "Category:Computational complexity theory" and "Category:Computational fields of study."

7. What is the purpose of using mathematical models in computational problems?
   Answer: To evaluate or quantify the resources needed for a solution.

8. How does computational complexity theory contribute to practical computing?
   Answer: By determining the practical limits of what computers can and cannot do.

9. What is the relationship between computational complexity theory and other fields?
   Answer: It is closely related to the analysis of algorithms and computability theory.

10. What is the significance of classifying problems in computational complexity theory?
    Answer: To understand their inherent difficulty and relationships, which helps in determining practical limits of computation.

I need to check if these answers are explicitly stated or can be inferred. For example, the answer to question 4 is based on the facts, which list several researchers. Question 6 refers to the categories mentioned in the facts. The rest are inferred from the context's descriptions.

I think this approach is valid. Now, I need to structure them as 10 pairs, ensuring they are distinct and cover different aspects.
