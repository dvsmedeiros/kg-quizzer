Okay, let's tackle this query. The user provided a bunch of RDF data about Victoria, Australia, and wants me to generate 10 question-answer pairs based on the given instructions. First, I need to understand the data structure here. The data is in RDF format, with subjects, predicates, and objects. The main subject here is "Victoria (Australia)" with various properties like area, GDP, etc.

The user's final instruction is to generate 10 pairs of "pergunta;resposta" (question;answer) based on the data. The rules mentioned are to use the information from the data, avoid external knowledge, and follow the examples provided. 

Looking at the data, I can see several properties:
- ns1:areaLandKm: 227444
- ns1:febRecordLowC: -3.9
- ns1:gdpNominalPerCapita: AU$68,996
- ns1:p: Colony of New South Wales
- ns1:postalCodeType: Postcodes in Australia
- ns1:subdivisionName: Australia
- foaf:depiction: images (though not sure if relevant here)

So, possible questions could be about the area, GDP, historical name, postal codes, etc. I need to make sure each question is directly answered by the data provided. For example, "What is the area of Victoria, Australia in square kilometers?" would have the answer 227444. Similarly, the GDP per capita is AU$68,996. 

I should check for other properties. The "p" property says "Colony of New South Wales" which might refer to the historical name. The postal code type is "Postcodes in Australia". Also, the subdivision name is "Australia", which might be a bit confusing, but the data says that. 

Wait, the "subdivisionName" for Victoria is "Australia", but Victoria is a state within Australia. That might be a data entry error, but since I can't use external knowledge, I have to go with what's given. So a question about the subdivision name would be "What is the subdivision name of Victoria, Australia?" with the answer "Australia". 

Another point is the "febRecordLowC" which is -3.9. So a question about the lowest temperature in February would be "What is the record low temperature in February for Victoria, Australia?" Answer: -3.9°C.

Also, the "gdpNominalPerCapita" is AU$68,996. So a question about GDP per capita would be "What is the nominal GDP per capita of Victoria, Australia?" Answer: AU$68,996.

I need to make sure each pair is unique and based on different properties. Let me list possible questions:

1. Area in square kilometers
2. GDP per capita
3. Historical name (Colony of New South Wales)
4. Postal code type
5. Subdivision name
6. Record low temperature in February
7. What is the area of Victoria, Australia in square kilometers?
8. What is the GDP per capita of Victoria, Australia?
9. What was the historical name of Victoria, Australia?
10. What is the postal code type for Victoria, Australia?

Wait, but some of these are similar. Let me check for more properties. The "p" property is "Colony of New South Wales" which might be the historical name. The "subdivisionName" is "Australia", which might be a bit odd but as per data. Also, the "areaLandKm" is 227444. 

I need to make 10 pairs. Let me make sure each question is different. Maybe include the "depiction" images, but the user might prefer factual data. Since the examples didn't include images, maybe avoid that. 

Another thought: The "p" property is "Colony of New South Wales" which might be the predecessor or historical name. So a question could be "What was the historical name of Victoria, Australia?" Answer: "Colony of New South Wales".

Also, the "subdivisionName" is "Australia", so "What is the subdivision name of Victoria, Australia?" Answer: "Australia".

The "febRecordLowC" is -3.9, so "What is the record low temperature in February for Victoria, Australia?" Answer: -3.9°C.

The "gdpNominalPerCapita" is AU$68,996, so "What is the nominal GDP per capita of Victoria, Australia?" Answer: AU$68,996.

The "areaLandKm" is 227444, so "What is the land area of Victoria, Australia in square kilometers?" Answer: 227444.

The "postalCodeType" is "Postcodes in Australia", so "What is the postal code type for Victoria, Australia?" Answer: Postcodes in Australia.

Another property is "subdivisionName" which is "Australia", so maybe "What country is Victoria, Australia a part of?" Answer: Australia. But the data says "subdivisionName" is Australia, so the question could be "What is the subdivision name of Victoria, Australia?" Answer: Australia.

I need to ensure that each question is distinct. Let me list 10:

1. What is the land area of Victoria, Australia in square kilometers?
2. What is the nominal GDP per capita of Victoria, Australia?
3. What was the historical name of Victoria, Australia?
4. What is the postal code type for Victoria, Australia?
5. What is the subdivision name of Victoria, Australia?
6. What is the record low temperature in February for Victoria, Australia?
7. What is the area of Victoria, Australia in square kilometers?
8. What is the GDP per capita of Victoria, Australia?
9. What is the historical name of Victoria, Australia?
10. What is the postal code type used in Victoria, Australia?

Wait, but some of these are repeating. For example, questions 3 and 9 are the same. I need to adjust. Maybe:

1. What is the land area of Victoria, Australia in square kilometers?
2. What is the nominal GDP per capita of Victoria, Australia?
3. What was the historical name of Victoria, Australia?
4. What is the postal code type for Victoria, Australia?
5. What is the subdivision name of Victoria, Australia?
6. What is the record low temperature in February for Victoria, Australia?
7. What is the area of Victoria, Australia in square kilometers?
8. What is the GDP per capita of Victoria, Australia?
9. What is the historical name of Victoria, Australia?
10. What is the postal code type used in Victoria, Australia?

But again, some are redundant. Maybe rephrase to avoid repetition. For example, use "What is the land area..." and "What is the area...", but that's a bit redundant. Alternatively, use different phrasing.

Another approach: Use different properties. For example, "What is the area of Victoria, Australia?" (answer 227444), "What is the GDP per capita?" (AU$68,996), "What was the historical name?" (Colony of New South Wales), "What is the postal code type?" (Postcodes in Australia), "What is the subdivision name?" (Australia), "What is the lowest temperature in February?" (-3.9), "What is the population?" (not in data), so can't use. 

Other properties: "p" is "Colony of New South Wales", "subdivisionName" is "Australia", "areaLandKm" is 227444, "febRecordLowC" is -3.9, "gdpNominalPerCapita" is AU$68,996, "postalCodeType" is Postcodes in Australia. 

So the 10 questions would be:

1. What is the land area of Victoria, Australia in square kilometers?
2. What is the nominal GDP per capita of Victoria, Australia?
3. What was the historical name of Victoria, Australia?
4. What is the postal code type for Victoria, Australia?
5. What is the subdivision name of Victoria, Australia?
6. What is the record low temperature in February for Victoria, Australia?
7. What is the area of Victoria, Australia in square kilometers?
8. What is the GDP per capita of Victoria, Australia?
9. What is the historical name of Victoria, Australia?
10. What is the postal code type used in Victoria, Australia?

But again, some questions are similar. Maybe adjust to make them distinct. For example:

1. What is the land area of Victoria, Australia in square kilometers?
2. What is the nominal GDP per capita of Victoria, Australia?
3. What was the historical name of Victoria, Australia?
4. What is the postal code type for Victoria, Australia?
5. What is the subdivision name of Victoria, Australia?
6. What is the record low temperature in February for Victoria, Australia?
7. What is the area of Victoria, Australia in square kilometers?
8. What is the GDP per capita of Victoria, Australia?
9. What is the historical name of Victoria, Australia?
10. What is the postal code type used in Victoria, Australia?

But this still has duplicates. Maybe replace some with different phrasing. For example:

7. What is the total area of Victoria, Australia in square kilometers?
8. What is the per capita GDP of Victoria, Australia?
9. What was the former name of Victoria, Australia?
10. What is the type of postal codes in Victoria, Australia?

This way, each question is phrased differently but refers to the same data. I think that's acceptable. Now, compiling the answers based on the data:

1. 227444
2. AU$68,996
3. Colony of New South Wales
4. Postcodes in Australia
5. Australia
6. -3.9°C
7. 227444
8. AU$68,996
9. Colony of New South Wales
10. Postcodes in Australia

But I need to make sure the questions are in Portuguese, as per the user's example. Wait, the user wrote "pergunta;resposta" which is Portuguese for "question;answer". So the questions and answers should be in Portuguese. 

So, for example:

1. Qual é a área territorial de Victoria, Austrália em quilômetros quadrados?
Resposta: 227444

2. Qual é o PIB per capita nominal de Victoria, Austrália?
Resposta: AU$68.996

3. Qual era o nome histórico de Victoria, Austrália?
Resposta: Colônia da Nova Gales do Sul

4. Qual é o tipo de código postal para Victoria, Austrália?
Resposta: Códigos Postais da Austrália

5. Qual é o nome da subdivisão de Victoria, Austrália?
Resposta: Austrália

6. Qual é a temperatura mínima registrada em fevereiro para Victoria, Austrália?
Resposta: -3,9°C

7. Qual é a área de Victoria, Austrália em quilômetros quadrados?
Resposta: 227444

8. Qual é o PIB per capita de Victoria, Austrália?
Resposta: AU$68.996

9. Qual era o nome histórico de Victoria, Austrália?
Resposta: Colônia da Nova Gales do Sul

10. Qual é o tipo de códigos postais usados em Victoria, Austrália?
Resposta: Códigos Postais da Austrália

Wait, but the user's examples might have different phrasing. Also, in the data, the "p" property is "Colony of New South Wales", which in Portuguese is "Colônia da Nova Gales do Sul". The "subdivisionName" is "Australia", so in Portuguese, "Austrália". The "postalCodeType" is "Postcodes in Australia", which translates to "Códigos Postais da Austrália". The "febRecordLowC" is -3.9, so in Portuguese, it's -3,9°C (using comma as decimal separator). The "gdpNominalPerCapita" is AU$68,996, which would be AU$68.996 in Brazilian format, but the original data uses a comma, so maybe keep as AU$68,996. The "areaLandKm" is 227444, which is the same in both formats.

So the final 10 pairs should be in Portuguese, with the answers as per the data. I need to make sure that each question is unique and the answers are accurate based on the provided data.
