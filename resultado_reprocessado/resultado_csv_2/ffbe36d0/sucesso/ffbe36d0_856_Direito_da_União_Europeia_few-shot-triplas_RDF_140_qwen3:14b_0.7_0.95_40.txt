Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants 10 question-answer pairs based on the provided context and facts. First, I need to understand the context thoroughly. The context talks about the European Union's legal system, its origins, objectives, institutions, and the role of the Court of Justice. The facts mention some legal scholars and resources related to EU law, like the Common Market Law Review and Henry G. Schermers.

Now, the user wants questions that are varied and cover different aspects. Let me list possible topics: origins of the EU, objectives, institutions, the role of the Court of Justice, legal scholars, academic disciplines, and sources of EU law. Wait, the context doesn't mention specific sources like treaties or regulations, but the examples did. However, the current context doesn't include that info. Hmm, maybe I should focus only on the given context.

Wait, the examples might have been based on different contexts, but the user now provided a new context. So, the current context includes the founding of the European Coal and Steel Community post-WWII, the objectives of promoting peace and well-being, institutions that transcend nation-states, and the Court of Justice's view of the EU as a new international legal order.

So possible questions could be about the founding entity, the objective of the EU, the role of institutions, the Court of Justice's stance, and maybe the legal scholars mentioned in the facts. But the facts are in RDF format, mentioning people like Henry G. Schermers and John Bell, and resources like the Common Market Law Review. However, the user's instruction says to base questions strictly on the provided content, which includes both the context and the facts.

Wait, the context is the paragraph about the EU's laws, and the facts are the RDF triples. But the user might expect questions based on both. However, the examples given by the user in the prompt were based on the law of the EU, which isn't explicitly detailed in the current context. The current context is more about the structure and purpose of EU laws, not the specifics of their sources.

So, I need to be careful. The user's context mentions that the EU's laws are a system of rules operating in member states, the founding of the European Coal and Steel Community, the objective of promoting peace, values, and well-being, the institutions that transcend nation-states for cooperation, and the Court of Justice's view of the EU as a new international legal order.

The facts are about academic disciplines related to EU law, scholars, and resources. But the user might want questions that combine both context and facts. However, the user's instruction says to base questions on the context and facts provided. But the examples in the prompt were about the law of the EU, which isn't explicitly in the current context. The current context is more about the system of laws, not the specifics of the law itself.

Wait, perhaps the user made a mistake in the examples, but I need to follow the current context. Let me recheck the context:

"The laws of the European Union are a system of rules that operate in the member states of the European Union (EU). Since the founding of the European Coal and Steel Community after World War II, the EU has developed the objective of 'promoting peace, its values and the well-being of its peoples'. The EU has political, social, and economic institutions that transcend the nation-state for purposes of cooperation and human development. According to its Court of Justice, the EU represents 'a new legal order of international law'."

So, from this, possible questions could be:

1. What is the objective of the European Union according to the context?
   Answer: promoting peace, its values, and the well-being of its peoples.

2. What was the first institution founded by the EU?
   Answer: the European Coal and Steel Community.

3. What does the EU's Court of Justice say about the EU?
   Answer: it represents a new legal order of international law.

4. What kind of institutions does the EU have?
   Answer: political, social, and economic institutions that transcend the nation-state.

5. How do EU laws operate?
   Answer: as a system of rules operating in the member states.

6. What is the role of the EU's institutions?
   Answer: to cooperate and develop human welfare beyond the nation-state.

7. What is the main goal of the EU's institutions?
   Answer: cooperation and human development.

8. What does the EU's Court of Justice consider the EU to be?
   Answer: a new legal order of international law.

9. Since which event did the EU develop its objective of promoting peace?
   Answer: the founding of the European Coal and Steel Community after World War II.

10. What is the significance of the EU's institutions according to the context?
    Answer: they transcend the nation-state for cooperation and human development.

Now, checking for repetition and ensuring each question is unique. The answers should be directly from the context. The facts mentioned in the RDF might not be relevant here unless the user wants questions about them. However, the user's instruction says to base on both context and facts, but the examples in the prompt were about EU law, which isn't in the current context. Therefore, perhaps the user expects questions based on the context provided, not the facts. The facts might be more about academic disciplines, which aren't covered in the context paragraph.

Wait, the context doesn't mention any of the facts like the Common Market Law Review or the scholars. The user might have included them as part of the facts but they might not be relevant for the questions. Unless the user wants to include those. But the instruction says to generate questions based on the context and the facts provided. However, the context and the facts are separate. The context is the paragraph, the facts are the RDF triples.

But the user's instruction says: "Gere pares de perguntas e respostas relevantes e corretas, exclusivamente a partir do conteúdo fornecido." So, "content" includes both the context and the facts. However, the context is in Portuguese and the facts are in RDF, which is a machine-readable format. But the user might have intended that the context is the paragraph and the facts are the RDF triples, but how to generate questions from the RDF? For example, the RDF mentions that Henry G. Schermers has a sub-discipline of EU law, and John Bell's academic discipline is EU law. The Common Market Law Review's academic discipline is EU law.

But the user's examples in the prompt were about EU law in general, which might not be covered in the current context. However, the user's current context doesn't mention EU law as a subject, but the facts do. So perhaps the user wants to combine both. But the context is in Portuguese and the facts are in RDF, which might not be easy to parse for the questions. However, the user might have intended that the facts are additional information to be used alongside the context.

But the user's instruction says to use only the provided content. The context is the paragraph in Portuguese, and the facts are the RDF. However, the RDF is in English, but the user wants the questions in Portuguese. So perhaps the user made a mistake in the instructions, but I need to proceed with what's given.

Alternatively, maybe the user intended that the context is the paragraph and the facts are part of the content, even though they are in RDF. However, generating questions from the RDF might be challenging. For example, the fact that Henry G. Schermers has a sub-discipline of EU law. So a question could be: "Qual é a sub-disciplina acadêmica de Henry G. Schermers?" with the answer "Direito da União Europeia."

But the user might not have intended that, as the context doesn't mention these scholars. However, the instruction says to use the content provided, which includes both the context and the facts. Therefore, I need to include questions that can be derived from both the context and the facts.

But the user's examples in the prompt were based on EU law, which is not covered in the current context. Therefore, perhaps the user made a mistake in the examples and the context, but I have to follow the current instructions.

Given the ambiguity, I'll proceed to generate questions based on the context provided, which is the paragraph in Portuguese. The facts in RDF might be relevant, but without clear instructions on how to integrate them, it's safer to focus on the context.

Therefore, the 10 questions would be based on the context paragraph, covering the founding of the Coal and Steel Community, the EU's objective, the role of institutions, the Court of Justice's statement, etc.
