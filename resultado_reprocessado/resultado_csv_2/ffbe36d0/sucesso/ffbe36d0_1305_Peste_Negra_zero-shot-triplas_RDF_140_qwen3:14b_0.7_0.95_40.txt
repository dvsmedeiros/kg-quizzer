Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs based on the provided context about the Black Death. Let me start by reading through the context carefully to identify key points and facts that can be turned into questions.

First, the context mentions that the Black Death is also known as the Great Plague, and it was the most devastating pandemic in human history, killing 75-200 million people in Eurasia, peaking in Europe between 1347-1351. The cause is believed to be Yersinia pestis, leading to different forms of plague. It was the first major European outbreak and the second pandemic. The disease originated in Central or East Asia, spread via the Silk Road to Crimea, then through fleas on rats on Genoese merchant ships to the Mediterranean and Italy. It's estimated to have killed 30-60% of Europe's population, reducing the world population from 475 million to 350-375 million in the 14th century. Europe took about 200 years to recover, with some regions like Florence only recovering in the 19th century. The plague returned in outbreaks until the early 20th century.

Now, I need to make sure each question is different and covers various aspects. Let's brainstorm possible questions:

1. What is another name for the Black Death?
2. What percentage of Europe's population is estimated to have died from the Black Death?
3. Which bacterium is associated with the Black Death?
4. Where did the Black Death originate?
5. How did the Black Death spread from Asia to Europe?
6. What was the impact on the world population during the Black Death?
7. Which regions were affected by the Black Death?
8. How long did it take for Europe's population to recover after the Black Death?
9. What were the different forms of plague caused by Yersinia pestis?
10. When did the Black Death reach its peak in Europe?

Now, check if these are all covered in the context and ensure answers are accurate. Also, avoid repetition. For example, the origin is mentioned as Central or East Asia, spread via the Silk Road and Genoese ships. The forms are bubonic, septicemic, and pneumonic. The population impact is 30-60% in Europe and global reduction from 475M to 350-375M. Recovery took 200 years, with Florence recovering in the 19th century. The peak was 1347-1351. The bacterium is Yersinia pestis. Regions affected include Eurasia, North Africa, etc. The plague returned until the early 20th century.

I need to make sure each answer is directly from the context. Let me structure each pair now.
