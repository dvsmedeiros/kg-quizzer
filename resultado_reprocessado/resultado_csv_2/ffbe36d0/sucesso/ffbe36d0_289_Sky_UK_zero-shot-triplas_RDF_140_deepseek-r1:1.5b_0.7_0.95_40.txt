Okay, let me try to figure out how to approach this problem. The user wants a JSON array with exactly 10 pairs of questions and answers related to British Satellite Broadcasting (BSB). Each pair should have a question relevant and a correct answer from the provided facts.

First, I need to understand the context. From the given information, BSB was founded in 1986 and is a satellite TV channel in London. They have several films and other productions. So, I can create questions about their history, production companies, notable events, etc.

I should come up with different aspects that cover various categories: perhaps their history, production history, notable events, production company details, etc. Each question should be unique and clearly relate to the context provided.

Let me list out possible questions:

1. What is BSB's main purpose? That's straightforward.
2. Who was the founder of British Sky Television (BKY), which became BSB?
3. Which film did BSB produce? There are several films listed, so I can ask about one specific one.
4. Which production company did they hire for a project, like "Memphis_Belle" or "Now".
5. Are there any notable events where BSB has been involved besides "The Computer Channel (BSB)" and "The Movie Channel"? Maybe a recent show or event.
6. What is the primary focus of BSB's production company? For example, does it focus on films, TV shows, etc.?
7. Is BSB part of any other organizations beyond being associated with Sky Television?
8. Who are the key employees or people that contribute to BSB's operations?
9. How many channels has BSB been involved in historically?
10. Any notable achievements or events related to their history?

Now, I'll map these questions to the provided facts:

1. **What is BSB's main purpose?** - The primary topic is about BSB's purpose.
2. **Who was the founder of British Sky Television (BKY), which became BSB?** - Founders are given in the facts.
3. **Which film did BSB produce?** - Look for "Memphis_Belle" and see ownership.
4. **Which production company did they hire for a project, like "Memphis_Belle" or "Now"?** - Both films are listed with ownership companies.
5. **Are there any notable events where BSB has been involved besides "The Computer Channel (BSB)" and "The Movie Channel (BSB)"; maybe a recent show?** - Not sure if there's a recent one, but I might have to ask about more recent or unrelated ones.
6. **What is the primary focus of BSB's production company?** - From the facts, they are involved in film and TV shows primarily.
7. **Is BSB part of any other organizations beyond being associated with Sky Television?** - Skypedb is a satellite channel owned by Sky Television.
8. **Who are the key employees or people that contribute to BSB's operations?** - The company owns several people, like the owner from the facts.
9. **How many channels has BSB been involved in historically?** - From the facts, they have 10 channels listed.
10. **Any notable achievements or events related to their history?** - Some achievements are mentioned under "Successor" and "FoundingYear".

Now, I'll structure each question with a clear answer from the facts provided.

I need to make sure that each response is unique and correct. Some of them might require more than one fact, but as long as they can be answered without ambiguity, it's fine.

For example:

- Question 5 could focus on another notable event if there isn't one mentioned.
- Questions about production companies would use the ownership details from the facts.

I'll make sure not to repeat questions that are already covered and that each answer is accurate based on the provided information. Also, I need to present them in a JSON format with specific keys as per the instructions.

Finally, I'll compile all 10 pairs into a JSON array and ensure it's formatted correctly without any markdown or extra explanations.
