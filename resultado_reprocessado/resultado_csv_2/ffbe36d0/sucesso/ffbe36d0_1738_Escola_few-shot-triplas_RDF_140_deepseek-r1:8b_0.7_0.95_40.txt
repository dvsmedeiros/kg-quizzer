Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to answer these questions based on the provided data. Let me start by reading through the examples and the instructions carefully.

The user has given a list of 10 question-response pairs in Portuguese. The task is to generate new ones following similar structures and patterns. The key seems to be understanding the context from which each example is derived, especially focusing on the terminology related to private schools, scholarships, funding, and educational terms.

Looking at the first example: "Juntamente com as escolas não-governamentais e não estatais, qual é o outro nome para escolas particulares?" The response is "independentes." So, it's about synonyms for private schools when combined with non-governmental and non-public schools. They use "independent" as the other term.

The second example talks about a type of scholarship that includes sports and arts, mentioning "acadêmicas)." This seems to be referring to academic scholarships.

The third question is about funding instead of taxation for private schools, and the response is "mas escolas." So, it's comparing private schools to others in terms of funding sources.

The fourth example asks what right private schools have that public schools don't, and the answer is the ability to select students.

The fifth question asks about the annual cost of some prestigious prep schools in New England, with a response of $45,000.

The sixth example refers to private schools that don't charge tuition, using the term "sem taxa."

The seventh question mentions countries like Canada and the UK not referring to universities as private schools, and the answer is Australia.

The eighth question asks which region uses "private schools" to refer to universities, and the answer is North America.

The ninth example is about another term for 12th grade education, with the response being "sexto menor." Wait, that seems off. In Portuguese, the 12th grade is typically called "doês ano de superior," but maybe it's a typo or regional term.

Similarly, the tenth question asks about another term for the 13th grade, responding with "sexto superior)." Again, I think this might be a specific regional term or an error.

Now, to generate new questions following these patterns:

1. **Juntamente com...** - Asking for a synonym when combined with other types of schools.
2. **Juntamente com...** - Referring to types of scholarships involving sports and arts.
3. **Em vez de tributação...** - Comparing funding methods between private and public schools.
4. **Que direito tem...** - Right to select students.
5. **Qual é o custo anual...** - Annual cost of specific prep schools.
6. **Como são chamadas...** - Private schools without tuition.
7. **Juntamente com...** - Countries not referring to universities as private schools.
8. **Que região usa...** - Region using "private schools" for universities.
9. **Qual é outro termo...** - Alternative term for a specific grade level (e.g., 12th or 13th).
10. Another similar question about terms related to education, maybe another grade level or educational aspect.

I need to make sure the new questions follow these structures and correctly incorporate the terminology. For example, in the ninth question, if it's about the 12th grade, I should think of an alternative term used for it. In some regions, the 12th year might be referred to differently, maybe "doês ano de secundar" or something similar.

Also, ensuring that each response accurately matches the question, using appropriate synonyms and educational terms in Portuguese.
