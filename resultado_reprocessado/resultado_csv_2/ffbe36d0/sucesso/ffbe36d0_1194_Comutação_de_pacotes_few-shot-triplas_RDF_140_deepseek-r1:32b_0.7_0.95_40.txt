Okay, so I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs based on the provided context and facts about packet switching in computer networks. Let me start by reading through the context carefully.

The context explains that packet switching is a method where data packets are individually routed between nodes over shared connections. It contrasts with circuit switching, which sets up dedicated connections even when no data is being transmitted. Packet switching optimizes bandwidth usage, reduces latency, and increases communication robustness but introduces complexity and variations in service quality due to statistical time-division multiplexing.

There are two types of packet switching mentioned: connection-oriented (circuit virtual) and connectionless (datagram). The former establishes a fixed path for all packets, ensuring ordered delivery but requiring more resources. Examples include ATM, Frame Relay, and X.25. The latter sends each packet independently, offering flexibility and robustness as the network can reroute around broken links, exemplified by IP addressing.

Looking at the facts provided, there are several people associated with packet switching: Donald Davies, Paul Baran, Sharla Boehm, and W. David Sincoskie. Each is noted for their contributions or expertise in this area.

Now, I need to create 10 varied questions covering different aspects of the context and facts without repeating similar ones. The answers must be directly extractable from the provided information.

Let me list potential topics:
1. Definition and contrast with circuit switching.
2. Benefits of packet switching (bandwidth optimization, latency reduction).
3. Types of packet switching (connection-oriented vs. connectionless).
4. Examples of each type.
5. People associated with developing or contributing to packet switching concepts.
6. Characteristics of each type, like ordered delivery or independent routing.

I should ensure that each question is unique and covers a different aspect. Let me think through possible questions:

1. What is packet switching? (Definition)
2. How does packet switching compare to circuit switching?
3. What are the main benefits of packet switching?
4. What are the two types of packet switching mentioned?
5. Can you give examples of connection-oriented packet switching?
6. Which method offers independent routing and better network adaptability?
7. Who is associated with developing packet switching concepts? (Donald Davies, Paul Baran)
8. What does Sharla Boehm specialize in?
9. What is a characteristic of datagram-based packet switching?
10. How does connection-oriented packet switching ensure ordered delivery?

Wait, some of these might be too similar or not directly answerable from the context. Let me check each against the provided info.

For example, question 7: The facts mention several people known for packet switching. So, a better phrasing could be asking who developed it, listing all four names.

Similarly, question 5 should list examples like ATM and Frame Relay for connection-oriented.

I need to make sure that each answer is concise and directly taken from the context or facts.

Another consideration: avoid leading questions. Each question should be clear and straightforward.

Let me try restructuring:

1. What is packet switching?
2. How does packet switching differ from circuit switching?
3. What are the main advantages of using packet switching?
4. Name two types of packet switching.
5. Provide examples of connection-oriented packet switching.
6. What type of packet switching allows independent routing and better network adaptability?
7. Who were key contributors to the development of packet switching?
8. What is Sharla Boehm's academic focus?
9. In datagram-based packet switching, what must always be included in each packet?
10. How does connection-oriented packet switching ensure that packets arrive in order?

I think these cover a range of topics without overlap. Now, I'll formulate them into proper questions and ensure the answers are accurate based on the given context.
