Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs based on the provided context and facts about the Huguenots. Let me start by understanding the context given. The Huguenots were French Protestants during the religious wars in the 16th century. They left France after the persecution under Louis XIV and the revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685. They were mainly Calvinists in the Reformed Church, while some in Alsace, Moselle, and Montbéliard were German Lutherans.

Now, looking at the facts, there are several images and templates mentioned, like Huguenot obelisk.jpg, French Protestant Church.jpg, and others. Also, there's information about their diaspora, related groups like Scotch-Irish Americans, and historical events like the Massacre of La Rochelle.

I need to make sure the questions cover different aspects: history, religion, diaspora, related groups, events, images, and maybe some specific facts like the Edict of Nantes. Let me brainstorm possible questions.

First, the Edict of Nantes was revoked in 1685, leading to the exodus. A question about that would be good. Then, their religious affiliations: Calvinists vs. Lutherans. Another question about the main religion they followed. The Massacre of La Rochelle is mentioned as an event. Also, the diaspora in places like New York and Staten Island. Maybe the connection to Scotch-Irish Americans. The images associated with them, like the Huguenot cross or the obelisk. Also, the categories they are part of, like French diaspora or anti-Catholicism. The number of people who left France. The time period of the religious wars. The main cause of their exodus. The significance of the Edict of Nantes. Maybe the political context under Louis XIV.

I need to avoid repeating similar questions. Let me check each fact again. The Edict of Nantes was revoked in 1685, leading to the exodus. The main religion was Calvinism in the Reformed Church, but some were Lutherans. The Massacre of La Rochelle is an event. The diaspora in New York and Staten Island. The connection to Scotch-Irish Americans. The images like the Huguenot cross or the obelisk. The categories they are in, like French diaspora or anti-Catholicism. The number of people who left (around 300,000). The time period (second half of the 16th century). The main cause of their exodus (persecution and revocation of the Edict). The political context under Louis XIV.

I need to make sure each question is unique and covers different aspects. Let me list 10 possible questions:

1. When was the Edict of Nantes revoked, leading to the exodus of Huguenots?
2. What was the main religious denomination of the Huguenots in France?
3. Which historical event is associated with the persecution of Huguenots in France?
4. What is the name of the event where 300 Protestant families were expelled from La Rochelle?
5. Which U.S. locations are named in honor of the Huguenots?
6. What is the religious group that is historically linked to the Huguenots?
7. What is the name of the emblematic image associated with the Huguenots?
8. What is the primary category that the Huguenots are associated with in French history?
9. How many Huguenots left France after the revocation of the Edict of Nantes?
10. What was the main political context during the exodus of the Huguenots?

Now, I need to check if these questions are based on the provided context and facts. The first question is about the revocation of the Edict of Nantes, which is mentioned. The second is about their main religion, which is Calvinism. The third is the Massacre of La Rochelle, which is mentioned in the facts. The fourth is the expulsion of 300 families from La Rochelle, which is referenced in the image. The fifth is the U.S. locations, which are mentioned. The sixth is the connection to Scotch-Irish Americans, which is stated. The seventh is the Huguenot cross image. The eighth is the category of French diaspora. The ninth is the number of people, which is given. The tenth is the political context under Louis XIV, which is mentioned.

I need to ensure that the answers are accurate and derived from the context. Let me check each answer against the facts.

1. Revocation in 1685: Yes, the text says "revogação do Édito de Nantes, em 18 de outubro de 1685."
2. Main religion: Calvinists in the Reformed Church, but some were Lutherans. The answer should mention Calvinism as the main.
3. Massacre of La Rochelle: The text mentions "Massacre of the Vaudois of Merindol.jpg" and "Expulsion from La Rochelle of 300 Protestant famillies Nov 1661 Jan Luiken 1712.jpg," so the event is the Massacre of La Rochelle.
4. The name of the event: "Expulsion from La Rochelle of 300 Protestant families Nov 1661 Jan Luiken 1712.jpg" is the name.
5. U.S. locations: "Huguenot, Orange County, New York" and "Huguenot, Staten Island" are named in honor.
6. Scotch-Irish Americans: The text says "Scotch-Irish Americans está relacionado a Huguenots."
7. Huguenot cross.svg: The image mentioned is "Huguenot cross.svg."
8. French diaspora: The category "Category:Huguenots" and "Category:French diaspora" are mentioned.
9. 300,000: The text states "cerca de 300 000 deles deixaram a França."
10. Political context: "sob Luís XIV" is the political context.

I think these are all correct. Now, I need to structure them into JSON format without any markdown, just the array of objects with pergunta and resposta. Each question should be unique and cover different aspects. I need to make sure the answers are precise and based on the given facts.
