Okay, so I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs based on the provided context and facts about Fresno, California. Let me start by carefully reading through all the information given.

First, from the context, I know that Fresno is the fifth most populous city in California, located in Fresno County. It was founded in 1872 and incorporated in October 12, 1885. As of the 2020 census, it has over 542,000 residents, making it the 34th largest city in the US.

Looking at the facts provided, there's a lot about people born or died in Fresno, sports teams located there, radio stations, and other related information. My goal is to create varied questions that cover different aspects of Fresno without repeating similar ones.

Let me go through each fact one by one:

1. George N. Zenovich died in Fresno.
2. Fresno uses a specific Wikipedia template for cities with over 100k population.
3. Adam Prentice and Floyd H. Hyde were born there.
4. Fresno has area code 559.
5. It's governed under the Strong Mayor system.
6. KRDU and KSOF are radio stations in Fresno.
7. Coordinates of Fresno are given.
8. Fresno is home to various sports teams across different years.
9. Several individuals, including actors, athletes, musicians, etc., were born or died there.
10. Fresno has an area of 300.43862 square units.
11. There's a radio station KOFP-LP in Fresno.
12. Fresno is part of the San Joaquin Valley.
13. It uses certain Wikipedia templates and categories.

Now, I'll try to formulate questions based on these points:

1. What was the population of Fresno according to the 2020 census? (From context)
   - Answer: Over 542,000.

2. Who was born in Fresno, California?
   - But since many people were born there, maybe pick a notable one like Kevin Federline.

3. What type of government does Fresno have?
   - Strong Mayor.

4. Which radio stations are located in Fresno? (List some)
   - KRDU, KSOF, KOFP-LP.

5. How many people live in Fresno as per the 2020 census?
   - Same as question 1, but maybe phrased differently to avoid repetition.

Wait, I need to ensure each question is unique and covers different aspects. Let me rephrase some:

- What was Fresno's population in 2020? Over 542,000.
- Who died in Fresno? George N. Zenovich or others.
- What are the radio stations? KRDU, KSOF, KOFP-LP, KMGV, etc.
- What is Fresno's area code? 559.
- What is Fresno's geographical coordinate? 36.75°N, -119.7667°E.

Now, thinking about the sports teams: multiple basketball and football teams from different years are based in Fresno. So a question could be: Which sports teams are located in Fresno?

Also, considering famous people born there: Kevin Federline is a notable one.

Another point is the area of Fresno: 300.43862 square units.

And the fact that Fresno uses specific Wikipedia templates, though this might not make for a natural question.

I should also consider questions about its status as the county seat or its ranking in population.

Putting it all together, I can structure the questions to cover:

1. Population (2020)
2. Area code
3. Government type
4. People born there (e.g., Kevin Federline)
5. Radio stations
6. Geographic coordinates
7. Sports teams hosted
8. Notable deaths in Fresno
9. Total area
10. Its ranking as a city in the US

I think that covers a good range without repetition. Now, I'll structure each into a question-answer pair.
