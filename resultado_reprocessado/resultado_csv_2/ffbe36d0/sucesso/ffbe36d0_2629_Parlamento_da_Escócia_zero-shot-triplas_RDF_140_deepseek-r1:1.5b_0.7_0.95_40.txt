Alright, let me try to figure out how to approach this task. The user has provided a detailed problem description, including a wikidata page about the Scottish Parliament and some Wikipedia pages linked to it. They also gave an example of questions and responses, which seems to involve mapping each question to a specific response.

First, I need to understand what exactly is being asked here. It looks like the user wants me to generate 10 pairs of "pergunta" (question) and "resposta" (response) based on the given data. The previous example had 5 questions and their corresponding WIKI page links as responses.

But wait, looking back, the example response provided is a list of URLs for each question in the '/wikiPageUsesTemplate' column. So, I think the user wants each "pergunta" to be mapped to its corresponding WIKI page URL from the provided data. That would make 10 pairs as required.

Next, I'll need to extract all the questions from the problem description and then find their respective WIKI page links. From the problem statement, I see there are ten paragraphs with each containing a "pergunta" (question) and a "resposta" which is a WIKI page link. Each question seems to be related to specific aspects of the Scottish Parliament, such as political groups, structure, voting systems, etc.

So, my task is straightforward: extract these 10 questions and their corresponding WIKI page links from the provided text. I'll make sure each response is in the correct format, which is <url> for each "resposta".

I should also check if there are any exceptions or nuances. For example, some responses might have additional information, but looking at the previous example, it seems that each response was just a single URL. So, I'll assume that each WIKI page link provided in the problem is sufficient and does not require further extraction.

Once I've listed all 10 pairs, I should present them clearly as per the user's instruction.
