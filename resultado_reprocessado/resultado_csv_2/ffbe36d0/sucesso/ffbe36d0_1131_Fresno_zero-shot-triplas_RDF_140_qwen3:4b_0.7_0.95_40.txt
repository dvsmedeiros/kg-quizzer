Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs based on the provided data about Fresno, California. Let me start by understanding what the data includes. There are various entities mentioned: people, places, organizations, and some attributes like area codes, government types, etc.

First, I should identify the key entities and their associated information. For example, there's a mention of the area code "559" for Fresno. Also, the government type is "Strong Mayor." There are several people listed with their birth places or death places in Fresno. Places like the Kearney Bowl and Sun-Maid are mentioned with locations. There are also radio stations and broadcast areas linked to Fresno.

I need to formulate questions that are based on these facts. The questions should be in Portuguese, and the answers should be concise, using the data provided. Let me list out possible topics:

1. Area code of Fresno
2. Government type of Fresno
3. Notable people born in Fresno
4. Places in Fresno with specific locations
5. Radio stations in Fresno
6. Historical events or events related to Fresno
7. Organizations based in Fresno
8. Cultural or historical sites in Fresno
9. Other cities or areas related to Fresno
10. Maybe something about the city's population or other attributes

Wait, but the data mentions a "nearest city" for Jennie Lakes Wilderness, which is Fresno. Also, the area total is 300.438620798976. Also, there's a mention of the Physicians Building's location. Let me check the data again to ensure I don't miss any key points.

Another thing: the city is a county seat in Fresno County, and it's part of the San Joaquin Valley. Also, the area code is 559. There are some radio stations like KJWL, KMGV, etc., that are associated with Fresno. The city has a strong mayor government type.

So, possible questions:

1. What is the area code for Fresno, California?
   Answer: 559

2. What is the government type of Fresno?
   Answer: Strong Mayor

3. Which notable person was born in Fresno, California?
   Answer: Kevin Federline

4. What is the location of the Kearney Bowl?
   Answer: Fresno, California

5. Which radio station is based in Fresno?

7. What is the total area of Fresno, California?
   Answer: 300.438620798976 square miles

8. Which organization is located in Fresno?

9. What is the name of the city in California that is a county seat in Fresno County?
   Answer: Fresno

10. What is the exact location of the Physicians Building in Fresno?
   Answer: 36.75 -119.76666666666667

Wait, but the exact location is given as a point in the data, so that's a valid question. Also, there's the mention of the Sun-Maid location being in Fresno. So maybe another question about that.

Alternatively, maybe I should check if there are more entities. For example, the city is part of the San Joaquin Valley, so that's a possible question. Also, the city has a Wikipedia page with some templates.

But the user wants 10 pairs. Let me make sure I have 10 distinct questions. Let me count:

1. Area code
2. Government type
3. Notable person born
4. Location of Kearney Bowl
5. Radio station
6. Nearest city to Jennie Lakes
7. Total area
8. Organization in Fresno
9. County seat in Fresno County
10. Exact location of Physicians Building

That's 10. I think that's good. Now, I need to phrase these in Portuguese, making sure the questions are clear and the answers are accurate based on the data.
