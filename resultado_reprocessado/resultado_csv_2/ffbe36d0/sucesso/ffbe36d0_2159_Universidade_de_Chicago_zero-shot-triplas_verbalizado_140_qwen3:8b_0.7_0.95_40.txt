Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs based on the provided context and facts about the University of Chicago. Let me start by understanding the content thoroughly.

First, the context mentions that the University of Chicago is a private research university with various schools and programs. It has a large student body, notable alumni, and contributions to academic disciplines. The facts list many individuals associated with the university, their roles (alma mater, institutions, work locations), and some statistics like the number of students and rankings.

Now, the user wants 10 pairs. Each question should be varied and cover different aspects. I need to avoid repeating similar questions. Let me brainstorm possible questions:

1. What is the total number of students at the University of Chicago? (From the fact: 18452)
2. Which school is known for its contributions to economics and sociology? (Context mentions these disciplines)
3. Who is the university's most notable alumni in terms of Nobel laureates? (Context says 98 Nobel winners)
4. What is the name of the laboratory associated with the Chicago Pile-1? (Met Lab)
5. Which president's presidential center is planned at the university? (Barack Obama)
6. What is the university's ranking in the USNWR worldwide? (15)
7. Which university is associated with the development of the first self-sustaining nuclear reaction? (Chicago Pile-1)
8. Who is the university's most prominent alumnus in the field of computer science? (Adele Goldberg)
9. What is the name of the university's representative image? (University of Chicago wordmark.svg)
10. Which professor is associated with the Chicago School of Sociology? (Lewis A. Coser, mentioned in the facts)

Wait, need to check if all these can be derived from the given content. Let me verify each point against the context and facts.

For example, the number of students is 18452, which is mentioned in the facts. The Nobel laureates are 98, so the question about the most notable alumni could refer to that. The Met Lab is mentioned in the context. The Chicago Pile-1 is part of the Manhattan Project. The university's ranking is 15. Adele Goldberg is listed as an alumnus in computer science. The image is specified. Lewis A. Coser is mentioned as having work locations at the university. 

I need to ensure each question is unique and the answers are directly from the content. Let me structure these into 10 pairs, making sure they are clear and correct.
