Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs about Jacksonville, Florida based on the provided data. Let me start by reviewing the data given. 

First, the data mentions that Jacksonville is the largest city in Florida by population, with a population of 1,345,596 in 2010. It's ranked 12th in the U.S. by population. The city is part of Duval County and was consolidated into the county in 1968. The St. Johns River runs alongside it. There's also historical info about Fort Caroline, founded in 1564 by the French, and the Timucua people who inhabited the area before the French. The city is named after Andrew Jackson.

Now, looking at the examples provided, the questions are straightforward and fact-based. I need to make sure my questions cover different aspects of the data. Let's see:

1. Population rank and size: Already covered in examples. Maybe ask about the population density or metro population.
2. Condado (county): The example asks about the county and the consolidation year. I can ask about the county's name and the year of consolidation.
3. River: The St. Johns River is mentioned. Maybe ask about the river's name or significance.
4. Historical figures: Andrew Jackson is the namesake. Could ask about the origin of the city's name.
5. Historical sites: Fort Caroline and its founding year. Also, the Timucua people.
6. Distance to Miami: The example has a placeholder, but the data doesn't specify the distance. Maybe avoid this or use the data's lack of info as a question.
7. Other facts: Population density is 490.63 per km². The nickname "The River City" is mentioned. The exact match from skos:exactMatch might not be relevant for a question.
8. Additional data points: The city's population in 2010, its rank in the U.S., the consolidation year, the river, the namesake, historical inhabitants, and historical sites.

Wait, the user's example already has questions about the largest population, 2010 population, rank, county, consolidation year, river, distance to Miami, Fort Caroline, Timucua, and Andrew Jackson. So I need to come up with 10 new ones. Let me check the data again for other details.

Looking at the data for Jacksonville, Florida:
- It's the largest city in Florida by population.
- Population in 2010: 1,345,596.
- Ranked 12th in the U.S.
- Located in Duval County, consolidated in 1968.
- St. Johns River.
- Fort Caroline (1564), Timucua people.
- Named after Andrew Jackson.
- Population density: 490.63/km².
- Metro population: 1,733,937.
- Nicknames: "Jax", "The River City", "The Bold New City of the South".
- Established title: "Founded".
- Other info: Climate data (feb low, jun precipitation, may avg low), but maybe not relevant for general knowledge questions.
- There are also some other entries like the court of appeals, universities, etc., but those might be too specific.

So possible questions could be about:
- Population density.
- Metro population.
- Nicknames.
- The year of consolidation (already in examples, but maybe rephrase).
- The name origin (Andrew Jackson).
- The river's name (St. Johns).
- Historical inhabitants (Timucua).
- Fort Caroline's founding year (1564).
- The exact population in 2010.
- The rank in the U.S. (12th).
- The county (Duval).
- The establishment title ("Founded").

But the examples already cover some of these. Let me think of new angles. Maybe:

1. What is the population density of Jacksonville, Florida?
2. What is the metro population of Jacksonville?
3. What are the nicknames of Jacksonville?
4. What is the significance of the year 1968 in Jacksonville's history?
5. Who was the city named after?
6. What is the name of the river near Jacksonville?
7. What is the historical significance of Fort Caroline?
8. What indigenous people lived in the area before European settlement?
9. What was the population of Jacksonville in 2010?
10. What is the rank of Jacksonville in the U.S. by population?

But some of these are similar to the examples. Wait, the user's examples include the 2010 population, rank, county, consolidation year, river, Fort Caroline, Timucua, and Andrew Jackson. So I need to avoid repeating those and find other data points.

Looking back at the data, I see that the city's population density is 490.63/km². The metro population is 1,733,937. The nicknames are "Jax", "The River City", and "The Bold New City of the South". Also, the establishment title is "Founded", but that might not be a common question. 

Another point: the city is part of the St. Johns River, which is a major river in the area. The exact match from skos:exactMatch might not be useful here. Also, the foaf:depiction includes some images, but that's probably not relevant for questions.

So possible new questions could be:

1. What is the population density of Jacksonville, Florida?
2. What is the name of the river that runs alongside Jacksonville?
3. What are the nicknames of Jacksonville, Florida?
4. What was the population of Jacksonville in 2010?
5. What is the metro population of Jacksonville?
6. What is the rank of Jacksonville in the United States by population?
7. What indigenous people inhabited the area now known as Jacksonville before European contact?
8. What is the historical significance of Fort Caroline?
9. What year did the consolidation occur that made Jacksonville part of Duval County?
10. After whom was the city of Jacksonville named?

Wait, some of these might be similar to the examples. For example, the river question is similar to one in the examples. The user's example has a question about the river and the answer is "St. Johns,". So maybe I should avoid that. Let me check again.

The user's example has a question: "Que rio corre ao lado de Jacksonville?" with answer "St. Johns,". So I should not repeat that. Let me think of other data points.

Other data points:

- The city is part of Duval County (already in examples).
- The establishment title is "Founded" (not sure if that's a question).
- The climate data (feb low, jun precipitation, may avg record low) – maybe not suitable for general knowledge.
- The court of appeals has a duty station in Jacksonville.
- The university of Florida College of Pharmacy is in Jacksonville.
- The port of Jacksonville is located there.
- The population density is 490.63/km².
- The metro population is 1,733,937.
- The exact match from skos:exactMatch is a concept in WordNet, but that's probably not useful for a question.

So maybe the remaining questions could be about the metro population, population density, and the nicknames. Also, the establishment title might not be a common question, but the user's example includes the year of consolidation (1968) and the county (Duval).

Another angle: What is the name of the historical site in Jacksonville that was founded in 1564? Answer: Fort Caroline.

But that's similar to the example. Let me check the user's examples again. The example has a question about Fort Caroline's founding year, and the answer is 1564. So maybe I can ask about the name of the site founded in 1564, but that's already covered.

Alternatively, what is the significance of the year 1564 in Jacksonville's history? Answer: Fort Caroline was founded.

Another possible question: What is the name of the university located in Jacksonville? Answer: University of Florida College of Pharmacy (but that's a college, not a university). Maybe not the best choice.

Alternatively, what is the name of the port located in Jacksonville? Answer: Port of Jacksonville.

So possible new questions:

1. What is the population density of Jacksonville, Florida?
2. What is the metro population of Jacksonville?
3. What are the nicknames of Jacksonville, Florida?
4. What is the name of the port located in Jacksonville?
5. What is the significance of the year 1564 in Jacksonville's history?
6. What is the name of the river that runs alongside Jacksonville? (already in examples)
7. What is the historical site in Jacksonville that was founded in 1564? (already in examples)
8. What is the name of the university college located in Jacksonville? (University of Florida College of Pharmacy)
9. What is the establishment title of Jacksonville? (Founded)
10. What is the name of the cathedral located in Jacksonville? (St. John's Cathedral)

But some of these might be too obscure. For example, the cathedral's name is in the data, but it's not a commonly known fact. The port name is more general. The university college might not be a well-known fact. The establishment title "Founded" is probably not a standard question.

Alternatively, the user's examples have a question about the population in 2010, which is 1,345,596. The data also includes the metro population of 1,733,937. So a question about the metro population could be a new one.

Putting this all together, I can form the following 10 questions:

1. What is the population density of Jacksonville, Florida?
2. What is the name of the port located in Jacksonville?
3. What are the nicknames of Jacksonville, Florida?
4. What is the metro population of Jacksonville?
5. What is the significance of the year 1564 in Jacksonville's history?
6. What is the name of the cathedral located in Jacksonville?
7. What is the establishment title of Jacksonville?
8. What is the name of the university college located in Jacksonville?
9. What is the historical site in Jacksonville that was founded in 1564? (already covered, but maybe rephrase)
10. What is the name of the river that runs alongside Jacksonville? (already in examples, but maybe rephrase as "What is the name of the river associated with Jacksonville?" but that's similar to the example)

Wait, I need to avoid repeating the river question. Let me adjust:

Instead of question 10, maybe ask about the exact match from skos:exactMatch, but that's not helpful. Alternatively, the court of appeals duty station, but that's too specific.

Alternatively, what is the name of the federal court located in Jacksonville? Answer: United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit (but the data mentions "United States Court of Appeals" in the skos:exactMatch, but that's not specific).

This is getting a bit tricky. Let me finalize the list with the best possible questions without repeating the examples:

1. What is the population density of Jacksonville, Florida?
2. What is the name of the port located in Jacksonville?
3. What are the nicknames of Jacksonville, Florida?
4. What is the metro population of Jacksonville?
5. What is the significance of the year 1564 in Jacksonville's history?
6. What is the name of the cathedral located in Jacksonville?
7. What is the establishment title of Jacksonville?
8. What is the name of the university college located in Jacksonville?
9. What is the historical site in Jacksonville that was founded in 1564?
10. What is the name of the river associated with Jacksonville?

But the river question is similar to the example, so maybe replace it with the cathedral name. However, the cathedral name might not be a common question. Alternatively, the user's example has a question about the river, and the answer is "St. Johns,". So I should avoid that. 

Let me check again. The user's example has a question about the river and the answer is "St. Johns,". So I can't ask that again. So I need to find other data points. 

Other data points:

- The city is named after Andrew Jackson.
- The population in 2010 was 1,345,596.
- The rank in the U.S. is 12th.
- The consolidation year is 1968.
- The county is Duval.
- The establishment title is "Founded".
- The nicknames are "Jax", "The River City", "The Bold New City of the South".
- The exact match from skos:exactMatch is not useful.
- The court of appeals is in Jacksonville.
- The university of Florida College of Pharmacy is in Jacksonville.
- The port is in Jacksonville.
- The population density is 490.63/km².
- The metro population is 1,733,937.

So I can ask about the metro population, population density, and the nicknames. Also, the university college, the port, the significance of 1564, and the cathedral.

But the user's examples already have the population in 2010, rank, county, consolidation year, river, Fort Caroline, Timucua, and Andrew Jackson. So the remaining questions are about metro population, population density, nicknames, university college, port, cathedral, and the establishment title.

That's seven questions. Need three more. Maybe the establishment title ("Founded") and the court of appeals. But the court of appeals is a bit obscure. Alternatively, the name of the cathedral (St. John's Cathedral), which is in the data.

So the final list could be:

1. What is the population density of Jacksonville, Florida?
2. What is the metro population of Jacksonville?
3. What are the nicknames of Jacksonville, Florida?
4. What is the name of the port located in Jacksonville?
5. What is the significance of the year 1564 in Jacksonville's history?
6. What is the name of the cathedral located in Jacksonville?
7. What is the establishment title of Jacksonville?
8. What is the name of the university college located in Jacksonville?
9. What is the name of the federal court located in Jacksonville?
10. What is the name of the historical site in Jacksonville that was founded in 1564?

But some of these might be too specific. For example, the federal court is the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, but that's not explicitly mentioned in the data. The data mentions "United States Court of Appeals" under skos:exactMatch, but it's not clear which circuit.

I think I've covered the main points. The key is to ensure that the questions are based on the data provided and avoid repeating the examples. The user's examples include the population in 2010, rank, county, consolidation year, river, Fort Caroline, Timucua, and Andrew Jackson. So the remaining data points are population density, metro population, nicknames, port, cathedral, university college, and establishment title.
