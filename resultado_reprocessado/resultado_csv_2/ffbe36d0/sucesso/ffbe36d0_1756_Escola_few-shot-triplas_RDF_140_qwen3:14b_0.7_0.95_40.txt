Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs about private schools using the provided examples and the list of schools. Let me start by looking at the examples to understand the pattern.

The examples have questions that ask for synonyms, definitions, financial aspects, rights, costs, regions, and terms related to education levels. The answers are concise, sometimes with a comma or parentheses. The schools listed are all private, so I should focus on that.

First, I'll check the list of schools again. They are all private institutions from various countries. Maybe I can create questions about their locations, types, or unique features. For instance, using the example about "sem taxa" (no tuition), I can ask about schools that don't charge fees.

Another angle is the term "independentes" (independent) as another name for private schools. I can use that in a question. Also, regions like the Americas or Europe might use different terms, so that's a possible question.

Looking at the examples, some questions relate to financial funding (e.g., "Em vez de tributação, pelo que as escolas particulares são amplamente financiadas?"). I can create similar questions about funding sources or how they differ from public schools.

I should ensure that the questions are varied and cover different aspects: definitions, financials, rights, regions, terms, and specific examples. Also, check that the answers are accurate based on the examples and the list provided.

Wait, the list includes schools from different countries, so maybe a question about countries where private schools are called something else. The example mentions Australia, Canada, and the UK, so I can use that.

Also, the example about "sexto menor" and "sexto superior" relates to education levels. Maybe I can ask about the terms for the 12th and 13th years, but in the examples they used "ano 12" and "ano 13", so I need to be careful with that.

Another idea: some private schools are preparatory, so a question about the annual cost of such schools in a specific region, like New England as in the example.

Also, the examples mention "bolsas de talentos" (talent scholarships) in sports, art, and academics. I can ask about other types of scholarships or how they're funded.

I need to make sure each question is unique and not repeating the examples. Let me brainstorm some:

1. What is another term for private schools besides non-governmental and non-state?
2. Which countries refer to private schools as "independent"?
3. What is a common financial source for private schools instead of taxation?
4. What right do private schools have that public schools don't?
5. What is the annual cost of some notable preparatory schools in New England?
6. What are private schools without tuition fees called?
7. Which region uses "private schools" to refer to universities?
8. What are the terms for the 12th and 13th years of education?
9. What is another name for a university in the UK?
10. What is the term for a university in the American context?

Wait, the example mentions "América do Norte" (North America) using "escolas particulares" for universities. So maybe a question about that region.

Also, the answer for the 12th year was "sexto menor" and 13th "sexto superior". So that's a specific term.

I need to ensure the answers are accurate and match the examples. Let me check each question against the list and examples to avoid errors.
