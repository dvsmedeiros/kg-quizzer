Okay, the user wants me to generate 10 question-answer pairs in Portuguese based on the provided context and facts about civil disobedience. Let me start by understanding the context. The context explains that civil disobedience is a peaceful political protest against unjust laws or oppressive governments, originating from Henry David Thoreau and used by figures like Gandhi and Martin Luther King.

Now, looking at the facts, there are numerous examples of events and organizations that use civil disobedience. The user has provided a list of these, including specific instances like the 2021 Montenegrin episcopal enthronement protests, the 2017 Serbian protests, and so on. Also, there are mentions of templates and categories used in Wikipedia for civil disobedience.

I need to create questions that cover different aspects. The questions should be varied and not repeat similar topics. Let me list possible areas: origin, key figures, examples of events, related concepts, uses in different contexts, and maybe some specific details from the facts.

First, the origin: who formulated the concept? Answer is Henry David Thoreau. Then, key figures like Gandhi and MLK. Examples of events: the 2021 End SARS memorial protest, the Gwangju Uprising. Also, related concepts like nonviolence, activism by type, categories like dissent, direct action, etc.

I should make sure each question is unique and addresses different points. Let me check the facts again to ensure the answers are accurate. For example, the 2021 Montenegrin protests, the 2022 Kazakh unrest, the Women Disobey movement, and the Sisters Uncut. Also, the use of templates in Wikipedia, like Template:Cite book or Template:Portal bar.

Another point is the hiperônimo (hypernym) which is Refusal. Also, the image associated with civil disobedience is Benjamin D. Maxham's photo of Thoreau. The category in Wikipedia is Category:Civil disobedience.

I need to make sure each question is clear and the answer is directly from the facts. Let me start drafting the questions:

1. Who formulated the concept of civil disobedience?
2. Which movement used civil disobedience in the Indian independence struggle?
3. What is the hypernym of civil disobedience?
4. Which 2021 event in Montenegro used civil disobedience?
5. What is the Wikipedia template used for citing books related to civil disobedience?
6. Which 2017 event in Serbia used civil disobedience?
7. What is the main topic category for civil disobedience in Wikipedia?
8. Which 2022 event in Kazakhstan used civil disobedience?
9. What is the image associated with civil disobedience?
10. Which movement uses civil disobedience as a method?

Let me check if these are all covered in the facts. The answer to question 1 is Thoreau. Question 2 is Gandhi. Question 3 is Refusal. Question 4 is the 2021 Montenegrin episcopal enthronement protests. Question 5 is Template:Cite book. Question 6 is 2017 Serbian protests. Question 7 is Category:Civil disobedience. Question 8 is 2022 Kazakh unrest. Question 9 is Benjamin D. Maxham - Henry David Thoreau - Restored - greyscale - straightened.jpg. Question 10 is Women Disobey.

Yes, these are all covered in the facts provided. Each answer is directly from the given information. I need to make sure the questions are in Portuguese and the answers are correctly formatted. Also, avoid any repetition. Let me confirm each answer is correct based on the facts.
