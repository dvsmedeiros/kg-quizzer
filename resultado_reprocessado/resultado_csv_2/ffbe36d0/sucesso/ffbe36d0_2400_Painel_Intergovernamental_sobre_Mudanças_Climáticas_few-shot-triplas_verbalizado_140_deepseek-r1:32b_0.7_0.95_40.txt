Okay, so I need to create 10 question-answer pairs based on the provided context and facts about the IPCC. Let me start by reading through the context carefully.

The context explains that the IPCC was created in 1988 by the PNUMA and OMM under the UN. Its main goal is to synthesize knowledge about climate change, specifically global warming. It doesn't do original research but compiles existing work. The IPCC has produced five major reports since its inception. It's recognized as a leading authority on climate change and won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2007.

Looking at the facts provided, there are several key points:
- Types: It's classified under various categories like YagoLegalActor, WikicatUnitedNations, etc.
- Affiliations: It belongs to the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP).
- Key figures: Names like Filippo Giorgi, Rajendra K. Pachauri, Hoesung Lee are associated with it.
- Publications: "Renewable Energy Sources and Climate Change Mitigation" is authored by IPCC.
- Structure: It's based in Geneva, Switzerland, and has a chair as its leader.

Now, I need to generate varied questions covering different aspects without repeating similar ones. Each question should have a clear, correct answer from the given information.

1. **Creation Year**: When was the IPCC created? Answer: 1988.
2. **Creators**: Which two UN organizations created it? PNUMA and OMM.
3. **Objective**: What is its main goal? Synthesize knowledge on climate change.
4. **Research Method**: Does it do original research? No, it compiles existing work.
5. **Number of Reports**: How many major reports have been produced? Five.
6. **Recognition**: Which award did it win in 2007? Nobel Peace Prize.
7. **Leadership**: Who was a past chair and resigned in 2015? Rajendra Pachauri.
8. **Current Chair**: Who is the current chair? Hoesung Lee.
9. **Headquarters Location**: Where is its headquarters? Geneva, Switzerland.
10. **Type of Organization**: What type is it classified as under Yago? Legal Actor.

I think these cover different aspects without overlap and are all based on the provided context and facts.
