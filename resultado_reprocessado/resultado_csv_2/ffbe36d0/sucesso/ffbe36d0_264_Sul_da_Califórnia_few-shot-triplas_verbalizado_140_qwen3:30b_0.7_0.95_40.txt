Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants 10 question-answer pairs in Portuguese based on the given context and facts about Southern California. First, I need to make sure I understand the context and facts provided.

The context says that Southern California, or SoCal, is the third part of California with no clear boundaries, defined by physical features. It mentions the Pacific Ocean to the west, the Mexican border to the south, Arizona to the east, and a population of 23.8 million in 2019. The facts list various entities related to SoCal, like companies, locations, events, etc.

The rules are strict: 10 pairs, each with a unique question and correct answer from the content. No repetition, varied aspects, and answers must be explicit or inferable. The output must be JSON without any extra text.

First, I'll go through the context and facts to find distinct points. The context mentions the abbreviation SoCal, the lack of clear boundaries, geographical boundaries (Pacific, Mexico, Arizona), population in 2019, and the use of specific templates and images. The facts include things like companies operating there, events, landmarks, and other entities.

I need to form questions that cover different aspects. For example, the abbreviation, geographical boundaries, population, specific landmarks, companies, events, and other unique facts. I need to ensure each question is different and not similar to others.

Check for possible questions:

1. What is the common abbreviation for Southern California? (Answer: SoCal)
2. What are the western and eastern boundaries of Southern California? (Answer: Pacific Ocean and Arizona)
3. What is the population of Southern California according to the 2019 data? (Answer: 23.8 million)
4. What is the name of the image representing Southern California? (Answers like Sdmarina.jpg, Yucca Valley California 2017.jpg, etc.)
5. Which company operates in Southern California? (Answers like Fosselman's Ice Cream, USC Trojans, etc.)
6. What is the area of Southern California in square miles? (Answer: 56505)
7. What is the name of the template used for pages about Southern California? (Answers like Template:California, Template:Wide image)
8. Which event is located in Southern California? (Epicenter music festival, etc.)
9. What is the type of Southern California as per the data? (Answers like Region108630985, Place, etc.)
10. What are the subdivisions of Southern California? (Answers like San Luis Obispo County, Orange County, etc.)

Now, I need to make sure each answer is directly from the context or facts. For example, the population is explicitly mentioned as 23.8 million in 2019. The area is 56505 mi². The template names are in the facts. The subdivisions like San Luis Obispo County, Orange County, etc., are listed.

Avoid repetition. Each question should cover a different aspect. Check that answers are correct and not inferred unless explicitly stated. For example, the population is given, so that's direct. The area is also given. The image names are listed, so that's direct.

Now, structure each pair in JSON, ensuring proper syntax. No markdown, just the JSON array. Check for 10 pairs, each with unique questions and answers. Avoid any typos or errors in the JSON structure.
