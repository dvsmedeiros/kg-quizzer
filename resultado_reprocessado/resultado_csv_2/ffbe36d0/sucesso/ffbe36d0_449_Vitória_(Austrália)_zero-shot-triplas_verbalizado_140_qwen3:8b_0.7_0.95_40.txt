Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs based on the provided context and facts about Victoria, Australia. Let me start by understanding the content.

The context gives a lot of information about Victoria, like its population, geography, history, economy, and cultural aspects. The facts list various people, places, and entities associated with Victoria. 

First, I should identify different aspects of Victoria to cover in the questions. For example, geography (like rivers, mountains), history (like the separation from NSW), economy (PIB, industries), notable people, cultural landmarks, and administrative details.

Looking at the facts, there are mentions of specific places like African Safari World, Wallagaraugh River, Mount Feathertop, and others. Also, there are people born or died in Victoria, like Peter Nugent, Dianne Cook, and others. There are also institutions like universities, companies, and government bodies.

I need to ensure each question is unique and covers different areas. Let me list possible questions:

1. What is the capital city of Victoria? (Answer: Melbourne)
2. Which river is located in Victoria? (Answer: Wallagaraugh River)
3. When did Victoria achieve self-government? (Answer: 1855)
4. What is the PIB rank of Victoria? (Answer: Second)
5. Which university is the oldest in Victoria? (Answer: University of Melbourne)
6. Who is the current Governor of Victoria? (Answer: Linda Dessau)
7. What is the lowest recorded temperature in Victoria? (Answer: -3.9°C)
8. Which event is held annually at the Melbourne Cricket Ground? (Answer: AFL Grand Final)
9. Which landmark is associated with the Australian Open? (Answer: Melbourne Park)
10. What is the administrative region type of Victoria? (Answer: AdministrativeRegion)

Wait, I need to check if all answers are explicitly mentioned or can be inferred. For example, the PIB rank is mentioned as second, but the context says it's the second most populous. Wait, the context says "segundo estado mais populoso da Austrália" which is second most populous, not PIB. The PIB part says "PIB do estado de Vitória é o segundo mais alto na Austrália" so the answer for PIB rank would be second. 

Also, the answer to the capital city is Melbourne, which is stated in the context. For the Governor, the current one is Linda Dessau since 2015. 

I need to make sure each question is distinct and the answers are directly from the content. Let me verify each point again to ensure accuracy and that each answer is correctly derived from the provided info.
