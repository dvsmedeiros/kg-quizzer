Okay, so I need to generate 10 pairs of questions and correct answers based on the context provided about Fresno. First, I should review what's given.

Fresno is described as a city in California with specific facts: it's the largest city in Fresno County, has a population around 500,000, it's part of the San Joaquin Valley, its economy is driven by agriculture and manufacturing, the Tower District is a historic area with theaters and venues, the Fresno State University is a major higher education institution there, the Fresno Art Museum collects local artists' works, and the city has significant historical sites related to the San Joaquin Valley's role in the agricultural industry.

So I need to create 10 relevant questions. Each should be different aspects of Fresno and have one correct answer. Let me think about various angles: geography, economy, culture, education, history, etc.

1. Largest city in Fresno County: Fresno.
2. Approximate population: ~500,000.
3. Region it's part of: San Joaquin Valley.
4. Economic main industries: agriculture and manufacturing.
5. Location of Fresno State University: Fresno.
6. Notable museum: Fresno Art Museum.
7. Tower District known for: entertainment venues like theaters.
8. Historical sites related to which industry? San Joaquin Valley's agricultural industry.

I have 8 points, but I need 10. Maybe add more specifics:

9. What is the Fresno County Historical Museum known for? It focuses on local history and the San Joaquin Valley's role in agriculture.
10. Major universities nearby: Fresno State is the main one.

Wait, maybe I can expand on some points with more specific questions.

Alternatively, think of other aspects like climate, transportation, cultural landmarks, etc., but since the context doesn't provide that info, stick to what's given.

So, 10 questions could be:

1. Largest city in Fresno County.
2. Population estimate.
3. Valley it's situated in.
4. Main economic sectors.
5. University location.
6. Art museum name.
7. Tower District purpose.
8. Historical sites focus.
9. Where is the historical museum located? Or what does it focus on?
10. Nearby major universities.

Wait, that's 10. Maybe adjust phrasing to ensure they are distinct and each has a unique answer.

Let me list them properly with clearer questions:

1. What is Fresno considered as in Fresno County? The largest city.
2. Approximately how many people live in Fresno? ~500,000.
3. In which valley is Fresno located? San Joaquin Valley.
4. What are Fresno's primary economic activities? Agriculture and manufacturing.
5. Where is Fresno State University situated? In the city of Fresno.
6. Name the art museum in Fresno. Fresno Art Museum.
7. What is the purpose of the Tower District? It's a historic entertainment district with theaters.
8. What historical sites relate to Fresno's agricultural history? The Fresno County Historical Museum focuses on this.
9. Where can one find local art exhibits? At the Fresno Art Museum.
10. Which major universities are nearby Fresno? Fresno State is the main one, and others like UC Davis are nearby but maybe not specified.

I think these cover different angles without repeating questions.
