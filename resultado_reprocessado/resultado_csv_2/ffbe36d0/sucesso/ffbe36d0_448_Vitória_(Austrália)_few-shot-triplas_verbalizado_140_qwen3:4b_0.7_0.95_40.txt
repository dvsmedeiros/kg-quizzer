Okay, I need to generate 10 pairs of questions and answers based on the provided context and facts about Victoria, Australia. Let me start by carefully reading through the given information to make sure I understand all the key points.

First, the context describes Victoria as a state in Southeast Australia, its geographical location, population, capital city Melbourne, historical background, and economic and cultural aspects. The facts list various locations, people, and landmarks associated with Victoria. I need to create questions that are distinct and cover different aspects from these facts.

Looking at the examples provided, they cover topics like economy, population ranking, GDP per capita, cultural landmarks, historical events, and specific places. I should ensure my questions are varied and not repetitive. Let me check the facts again to find unique points.

For instance, there's information about the African Safari World being in Victoria, the Wallagaraugh River's mouth, Peter Nugent's death, the Transport Ticketing Authority's headquarters, the Australian Alps' grasslands, FoodWorks location, temperature records, Curdies River, Mount Feathertop, James Fairfax's education, Mount Loch, Dianne Cook's birth, Crawford Pasco's burial site, Ivy Weber's death, postcodes, Pieter Bourke's birth, Horsehead's origin, Cameron Johnston's birth, James Ryan O'Neill's birth, the image of Chinatown, Islamic Information's headquarters, Walton's location, Edwardes Lake, Collins Square, Queenscliff High Light, Margaret Geddes' birth, Judy Moran's birth, Wycheproof Airport, Carwatha College, Braemar College, Jason Gram's birth, the colony of New South Wales, Victorian College of Arts, Anne Minter's residence, Ronnie Burns' birth, Gordon Institute, Hanging Rock, Thomas Higinbotham's projects, GDP per capita, MacKillop Catholic College, Eddie Baroo's birth, Trafalgar High, 2019 All Stars, Department of Civil Aviation, Clement Meadmore's birth, Ashleigh McConnell's birth, Vermont Secondary College, John West's death, Keith Fagg's birth, Who Wants to Be a Millionaire, Lake Nagambie, Robert Jewell's death, Melbourne Convention Center, Thomas Carr College, Cbus, Macarthur Wind Farm, Korowa Anglican Girls' School, Charles Powers' death, Aidan McLindon's residence, Victoria's administrative region, Alfred McWaters' birth, Kevin Lindsay's birth, 1943 election, Consolidated Rail Leasing, Helen Haines' residence, Richard Crouch's death, Jake Stringer's birth, Laksmi De-Neefe's birth, Jim Park's birth, Princes Hill College, Darren & Brose, Bill Hegney's birth, Boxing Day Test, Queens Place, Gilbert Toyne's death, Jason Davidson's birth, Andrew Taylor's birth, Wayne Andrews' birth, Rostered On, Western Port, Nick Maxwell's birth, Noni Hazlehurst's birth, Craig Henwood's birth, Plenty River, Francis Ford Wilson's birth, Assumption College, Karen Overington's birth, Ross Smith's birth, Victoria's area, Little River, 1913 Goodall Cup, Mount McKay, Natalia Rahman's birth, Tsk Tsk Tsk's origin, 1911 Goodall Cup, Shoreside, Josh Frydenberg's birth, Catherine Deakin's death, Melbourne Aces, Margaret Geddes' birth, Alexander Arbuthnot's ship, Max Tucker's birth, Owen Dixon's birth, Andrew Scott's birth, Vision Australia, Farrer Hall, Rocklands Reservoir, The DC3, Denise Drysdale's birth, Sir Rupert Clarke's birth, Victorian Railways.

Now, I need to form questions that are based on these facts. Let me think of different categories: locations, historical events, people, economic aspects, landmarks, etc. For example, "Which famous landmark in Victoria is associated with the 1943 state election?" or "Where is the headquarters of the Transport Ticketing Authority located?" 

I should ensure each question is unique and that the answers are directly from the facts provided. Also, check that the answers are correct based on the given information. For example, the answer to "Where is the headquarters of the Transport Ticketing Authority located?" would be Victoria, as per the fact list.

Another point is the image of Chinatown, so a question about that. Also, the area of Victoria is 227,444 km², so a question on that. The GDP per capita is mentioned as fourth, but wait, the example says "quarto" which is Portuguese for fourth. However, in the context, the GDP per capita is mentioned as "quarto" in the example. Wait, but in the given facts, the GDP per capita is not explicitly stated. Wait, in the context, it says "product bruto do estado" which is Portuguese for "state's gross product", but the example says "quarto" which is fourth. However, the actual facts mention "Victoria (Australia) tem nome de subdivisão Australia" and "Victoria (Australia) é do tipo AdministrativeRegion". Maybe the GDP per capita is not directly mentioned in the facts, but the example uses that. However, the user provided the example, but the actual facts might not have that. Wait, in the facts, there's "Victoria (Australia) possui imagem representativa Victoria rainfall.jpg" and "Victoria (Australia) possui área terrestre (km²) 227444". But the example's answer about GDP per capita is "quarto", but in the facts, it's not explicitly mentioned. Wait, the user's example might have been based on prior knowledge, but according to the given facts, perhaps the GDP per capita is not mentioned. So maybe that example is not accurate. However, the user provided that example, so perhaps in the actual answer, I need to check if the facts have that information. But according to the facts provided, there is no mention of GDP per capita. However, in the context, it says "segundo" for the state's gross product, but the example says "quarto" for GDP per capita. But that might be a mistake. However, the user's instruction is to base the answers on the given facts. So perhaps in the given facts, the GDP per capita is not mentioned, so maybe that example is incorrect, but I need to follow the facts as given.

Wait, the user provided the example, but the user's instruction says to generate based on the given facts. Therefore, I need to make sure that the answers are based on the facts provided. Let me check again.

In the facts, there's "Victoria (Australia) possui imagem representativa Victoria rainfall.jpg" and "Victoria (Australia) possui área terrestre (km²) 227444". Also, "Victoria (Australia) é do tipo AdministrativeRegion". There's also "Victoria (Australia) tem nome de subdivisão Australia". So the area is 227,444 km². The example has a question about the GDP per capita being fourth, but in the facts, there's no mention of that. So maybe that example is incorrect, but I need to follow the facts as given.

Therefore, I should create questions that are based on the facts provided. Let me list the facts again to find possible questions:
