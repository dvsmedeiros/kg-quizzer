Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs based on the provided context and facts about Warsaw. Let me start by carefully reading through the given content to identify key points and facts that can be turned into questions.

First, the context mentions that Warsaw is the capital and largest city of Poland, located by the Vistula River, 260 km from the Baltic Sea, and 300 km from the Carpathians. It also talks about its population in 2012, industries, educational institutions, cultural landmarks, historical events, and recent rankings. The facts list a bunch of people born or died in Warsaw, organizations based there, and various other details like temperatures, locations of institutions, and historical events.

I need to make sure the questions are varied and cover different aspects. Let me list out possible topics: location, population, historical events, cultural landmarks, economic aspects, political institutions, notable people, geographical features, historical events, and maybe some specific facts from the list of people or organizations.

Looking at the examples provided, they include questions about the largest city, river, distance from sea, population, economic diversity, research, Frontex, etc. I should avoid repeating similar questions. For instance, the example already has a question about the largest city, so I should find another angle.

From the facts, there are several people associated with Warsaw. For example, Cymburgis of Masovia, Leopold Tyrmand, Pilecki Institute, Józef Popowski, Kazimierz Porębski, etc. Also, organizations like the Ministry of Finance, Warsaw Airport, etc. There are also specific facts about the temperature in April, the historical events like the Warsaw Uprising, the Ghetto, and the reconstruction.

I need to make sure each question is unique and based on the facts. Let me start drafting:

1. What is the capital of Poland?
2. In which river is Warsaw located?
3. How far is Warsaw from the Baltic Sea?
4. What is the name of the agency for European border security based in Warsaw?
5. Which historical event in Warsaw led to the destruction of the ghetto?
6. What is the name of the famous cathedral in Warsaw?
7. Which university is located in Warsaw?
8. What is the name of the bridge in Warsaw?
9. What is the temperature in Warsaw in April?
10. Which organization has its headquarters in Warsaw?

Wait, but some of these might not be accurate. Let me check the facts again. The context says that Warsaw is the capital, located by the Vistula, distance from Baltic Sea is 260 km. The Frontex is based there. The Warsaw Uprising in 1944 led to devastation, the Ghetto was destroyed in 1943. The cathedral mentioned is St. John's Archcathedral. The university is the University of Warsaw. The bridge is Śląsko-Dąbrowski Bridge. The temperature in April is 4°C. The Ministry of Finance is based there.

Also, the facts include the name of the city's historical center as a UNESCO site. The Warsaw Ghetto is a historical event. The temperature record in April is -1.6°C. The Ghetto Uprising was in 1944. The Ghetto was destroyed after a month of fighting.

Another fact is that Warsaw is the capital of the Masovian Voivodeship. The Pilecki Institute is based there. The Warsaw Ghetto is a key historical site. The temperature in December is 2.7°C.

So, possible questions:

1. What is the capital of Poland? (Answer: Warsaw)
2. In which river is Warsaw located? (Vistula)
3. How far is Warsaw from the Baltic Sea? (260 km)
4. Which organization is based in Warsaw for European border security? (Frontex)
5. What historical event in Warsaw led to the destruction of the ghetto? (Warsaw Ghetto Uprising)
6. Which cathedral is located in Warsaw? (St. John's Archcathedral)
7. Which university is in Warsaw? (University of Warsaw)
8. What is the name of the bridge in Warsaw? (Śląsko-Dąbrowski Bridge)
9. What is the temperature in Warsaw in April? (4°C)
10. Which political body has its headquarters in Warsaw? (Ministry of Finance)

I need to check if these are all covered in the facts. Also, the example had a question about the population in 2012, but the user didn't include that in the example. However, the problem says that the user provided examples, but the actual answer should be based on the given facts. Wait, the user's example includes a question about the population, but the answer is empty. However, in the actual facts, the population in 2012 is mentioned as the largest area, but the exact number is not given. Wait, the context says "quantos moradores tem a maior área metropolitana?" but the answer is "2.666 milhões" which is not in the facts. The facts don't mention the population in 2012, so maybe that's a mistake. But since the user provided that as an example, perhaps it's not necessary to include that unless it's in the facts. Wait, the facts do mention "Quantos moradores tem a maior área metropolitana?" but the answer is "2.666 milhões" which is not in the facts. So maybe that's a mistake, but the user's example includes that. However, the user's actual facts don't mention the population in 2012, so maybe that's an error. However, since the user provided that as an example, perhaps I should avoid that.

Alternatively, I can use other facts. The user's example had a question about the city being the 32nd most habitable, which was in 2012. The facts mention that the The World Economic Forum ranked it as 32nd in 2012. So that's a valid question.

So, possible questions:

1. What is the capital of Poland? (Warsaw)
2. In which river is Warsaw located? (Vistula)
3. How far is Warsaw from the Baltic Sea? (260 km)
4. Which agency is based in Warsaw for European border security? (Frontex)
5. What is the name of the historical event in Warsaw that led to the destruction of the Ghetto? (Warsaw Ghetto Uprising)
6. Which cathedral is located in Warsaw? (St. John's Archcathedral)
7. Which university is located in Warsaw? (University of Warsaw)
8. What is the name of the bridge in Warsaw? (Śląsko-Dąbrowski Bridge)
9. What is the temperature in Warsaw in April? (4°C)
10. Which political body has its headquarters in Warsaw? (Ministry of Finance)

I need to check if all these are accurate based on the facts. For example, the Ministry of Finance is mentioned in the facts. The answer for the temperature in April is 4°C, which is in the facts. The Warsaw Ghetto Uprising is a historical event mentioned in the context. The bridge's name is in the facts. The cathedral is in the facts. The university is in the facts. The Frontex is correct. The distance from the Baltic Sea is correct. The river is correct. The capital is correct.

Yes, these should be valid. Now, I need to structure them as per the user's example, ensuring that the answers are correctly extracted from the facts.
