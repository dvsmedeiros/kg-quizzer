Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to generate 10 question-answer pairs about Fresno. First, I need to make sure I have enough information about Fresno. Let me recall what I know.

Fresno is a city in California, part of the San Joaquin Valley. It's the largest inland city in the state. The population is around half a million. It's known for agriculture, especially producing grapes, tomatoes, and cotton. There's a university there, California State University, Fresno. The climate is semi-arid, with hot summers and mild winters. The city has some cultural landmarks, like the Tower Bridge and the Fresno Art Museum. Politically, it might lean Democratic, but I should check that. There's a sports team, the Fresno State Bulldogs. The name "Fresno" comes from Spanish, meaning "ash tree." The area was originally inhabited by the Yokuts people.

Now, I need to form 10 varied questions. Let's start with general facts: location, population, size. Then move to agriculture, education, cultural landmarks, climate, etymology, history, sports teams, and indigenous history. That should cover different aspects. Each question needs a clear, factual answer from the context. Avoid repetition. Let me list them out:

1. In which U.S. state is Fresno located? Answer: California.
2. What is the population of Fresno? Answer: Approximately 500,000.
3. What is the primary agricultural product of Fresno? Answer: Grapes, tomatoes, cotton.
4. Which university is located in Fresno? Answer: California State University, Fresno.
5. What is the climate of Fresno? Answer: Semi-arid with hot summers and mild winters.
6. What does the name "Fresno" mean in Spanish? Answer: Ash tree.
7. What indigenous group originally inhabited the area around Fresno? Answer: Yokuts people.
8. What is a notable cultural landmark in Fresno? Answer: Tower Bridge or Fresno Art Museum.
9. What sports team is based in Fresno? Answer: Fresno State Bulldogs.
10. What political leaning is typical in Fresno? Answer: Democratic (if I recall correctly, but need to confirm).

Wait, for the political leaning, I'm not 100% sure. Maybe it's better to avoid that if I can't be certain. Let me check again. California cities generally lean Democratic, so maybe it's safe. Alternatively, maybe focus on another aspect. Let me adjust if needed. Maybe instead, ask about the economy's main sector. Agriculture is the main economic driver. So that could be another question. Also, the largest inland city in California. That's a fact. Let me recheck the points to ensure all answers are covered. Each question should have a unique answer from the context provided. Alright, I think that covers 10 varied aspects without repetition.
