Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs based on the provided context and facts about civil disobedience. Let me start by understanding the context thoroughly.

The context explains that civil disobedience is a peaceful form of protest against unjust laws or oppressive governments. It was formulated by Henry David Thoreau and used by Gandhi in India's independence and Martin Luther King Jr. in the U.S. civil rights movement. The facts provided include various historical events and protests linked to civil disobedience, such as the 1998 Russian miners' strike, Montenegrin crises, Albanian protests, Serbian protests, and others. There are also mentions of specific people and movements like the Civil Rights Movement, the End SARS protests, and the Gwangju Uprising.

Now, the user wants 10 pairs with varied questions covering different aspects. Each question should have a unique answer based on the context. Let me make sure not to repeat similar questions.

First, I'll list key points from the context and facts:

1. Definition of civil disobedience.
2. Originators: Thoreau, Gandhi, MLK.
3. Historical examples: India's independence, U.S. civil rights, Gwangju Uprising, End SARS, etc.
4. Countries involved: India, U.S., Russia, Montenegro, Albania, Serbia, etc.
5. Specific events: 1998 Russian miners' strike, 2015-2016 Montenegrin crisis, 2017 Albanian opposition protest, etc.
6. Philosophical basis: nonviolent resistance, right to disobey an unjust government.

I need to create questions that cover these areas. Let me start drafting:

1. What is civil disobedience?
   Answer: A form of peaceful protest against unjust laws or oppressive governments.

2. Who formulated the concept of civil disobedience?
   Answer: Henry David Thoreau.

3. Which movement used civil disobedience for independence?
   Answer: India's independence movement led by Gandhi.

4. Which U.S. movement is associated with civil disobedience?
   Answer: The Civil Rights Movement led by Martin Luther King Jr.

5. What event in South Korea is linked to civil disobedience?
   Answer: The Gwangju Uprising.

6. Which country's miners' strike in 1998 used civil disobedience?
   Answer: Russia.

7. What is the name of the 2015-2016 crisis in Montenegro?
   Answer: Montenegrin crisis.

8. Which 2017 protests in Albania are associated with civil disobedience?
   Answer: Albanian opposition protest.

9. Which 2017 protests in Serbia used civil disobedience?
   Answer: Serbian protests.

10. What is an example of civil disobedience in Nigeria?
    Answer: End SARS protests.

Wait, I need to check if the answers are explicitly mentioned. For example, the Gwangju Uprising is listed in the facts, so that's okay. The End SARS protests are mentioned as well. The 1998 Russian miners' strike is another example. The Montenegrin crisis in 2015-2016 is also listed. The Albanian and Serbian protests from 2017 are mentioned. The answer for the U.S. movement is the Civil Rights Movement. The countries involved in the examples are covered. I need to make sure the answers are accurate based on the context provided.

Let me verify each answer against the facts:

- Gwangju Uprising is mentioned in the facts.
- End SARS protests are listed.
- Russian miners' strike (1998) is there.
- Montenegrin crisis (2015-2016) is present.
- Albanian opposition protest (2017) and Serbian protests (2017) are in the list.

That seems correct. Now, I can structure the questions and answers accordingly, ensuring they are clear and match the context. Also, check for any repetition and ensure each question is distinct.
