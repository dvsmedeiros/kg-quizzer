Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs based on the provided context and facts. Let me start by carefully reading through the context and the facts to understand the key points.

The context talks about oxygen's chemical properties, its role in the atmosphere, its discovery, and applications. The facts include information about companies that produce oxygen, related categories, images, Wikipedia templates, and notable people associated with oxygen.

First, I'll identify the main topics from the context. These include:
- Chemical properties (atomic number, electronegativity, reactivity)
- Role in the atmosphere and Earth's crust
- Discovery by Scheele and Priestley, Lavoisier's contribution
- Applications in industry, medicine, etc.
- Ozone and its role in the ozone layer
- Historical context of oxygen's discovery and naming

From the facts, there are mentions of companies like Inox Air Products and BOC Kenya Limited, categories like oxidizing agents and chalcogens, images related to oxygen, and notable figures like Carl Wilhelm Scheele, Joseph Priestley, and Antoine Lavoisier.

Now, I need to create varied questions that cover different aspects. Let's start with the chemical properties. For example, the atomic number and electronegativity. Then move to its role in the atmosphere, discovery, applications, ozone, and related categories.

I should ensure that each question is unique and not repeating the same aspect. Also, the answers must be directly from the context or facts provided. Let me check the facts again to see if there's anything else important. There's mention of companies, but the context doesn't talk about them, so maybe those are not relevant for the questions based on the context. The user said to base the questions on the context and facts, but the main content is the context. The facts might be additional data points, but the primary source is the context.

So, focusing on the context, here's how the questions could be structured:

1. What is the atomic number of oxygen?
2. Which two scientists discovered oxygen independently?
3. What percentage of Earth's atmosphere is composed of O2?
4. What is the primary role of oxygen in the Earth's crust?
5. Who is credited with naming the element oxygen?
6. What is the significance of the ozone layer?
7. How does oxygen contribute to the human body's cellular respiration?
8. What is the main source of oxygen in the Earth's atmosphere?
9. What are the physical properties of oxygen gas at standard conditions?
10. What is the historical significance of the discovery of oxygen?

Now, I need to make sure each answer is accurate based on the context. For example, the atomic number is 8, the scientists are Scheele and Priestley, the percentage is 20.8%, the role in the crust is forming oxides, Lavoisier named it, ozone's role in UV absorption, cellular respiration uses oxygen, photosynthesis as the source, and physical properties as colorless, odorless, etc.

I should also check the facts for any additional info that might be relevant, but the main context is the paragraph provided. The facts might include other info like companies, but the user said to base the questions on the context and facts, but the main context is the paragraph. The facts seem to be related to Wikipedia data, which might not be necessary unless the context mentions them. However, the user included both context and facts, so perhaps they are part of the data to use. But the context is the main source.

Wait, the user said "based on context and facts provided." So both the context paragraph and the facts list should be considered. However, the facts list includes things like companies, categories, images, etc., which might not be covered in the context. The context is the main source, but the facts could add more points. For example, the fact that Carl Wilhelm Scheele and Joseph Priestley discovered oxygen, which is in the context as well. Also, Antoine Lavoisier named it, which is in the context.

So, combining both, the questions can be drawn from both. But I need to ensure that the answers are from either the context or the facts. For example, if a fact states that Oxygen is in the category of oxidizing agents, that could be a question.

But the user's main context is the paragraph about oxygen's properties, discovery, applications, etc. The facts might be additional data points that can be used for questions, but I need to make sure they are relevant.

Let me proceed to create 10 pairs, ensuring each is unique and covers different aspects.
