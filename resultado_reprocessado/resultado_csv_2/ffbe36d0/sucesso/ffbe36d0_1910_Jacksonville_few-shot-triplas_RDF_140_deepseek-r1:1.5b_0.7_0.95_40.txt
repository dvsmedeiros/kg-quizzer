Alright, let me try to figure out how to approach this problem. The user has given me a detailed XML schema with information about the city of Jackson, Florida and some examples of questions and their answers. They want me to generate 10 pairs of "pergunta;resposta" based on the provided data.

First, I'll look through the data provided in the XML schema. It seems like there are numerous objects related to the city, such as population, birth years, rainfall, sports teams, and more. However, for creating questions, I need to focus on the most relevant ones that can be used to ask specific information about the city.

I should check each object and decide which ones will provide useful information for different types of questions. For example, knowing the population number could help answer how many people live there. Similarly, knowing the rainfall or average temperature would be another type of question.

Let me list out the objects that offer detailed data:

1. **Jacksonville, Florida**: location
2. **Population and Housing Data**: provides population counts and housing info.
3. **Rivers and Weather**: river information and weather stats.
4. **Sports and Team Info**: sports teams.
5. **Historical Figures**: names of historical figures.
6. **Coordinates**: latitude and longitude.
7. **Distance to Other Places**: distances between places.
8. **Other Objects**: additional details about the city.

Now, I'll map these into questions with their corresponding answers based on the provided examples. I should ensure that each question is clear and relevant. Let me go through them one by one:

1. What is the population of Jacksonville, Florida?
   - Answer: 1,345,596

2. How many residents does Jacksonville have in 2010?
   - Answer: 1.345.596 (I notice this might be a typo since numbers are usually written without commas like 1,345,596)

3. Which state is Jacksonville a part of?
   - Answer: Florida

4. When did the city become a part of the Duval County?
   - Answer: 1968

   - Answer: Andrew Jackson

10. How far is Jacksonville from other notable cities?
    - Answer: Approximately . (This might not be very helpful, but it's an example)

Wait, looking back at the examples provided, I see that in some cases like "Pergunta 2", there was a typo in the answer with commas. So, it's important to correct that. Also, for questions about coordinates, maybe using decimal points would make it clearer.

Let me adjust the answers accordingly:

1. What is the population of Jacksonville, Florida?
   - Answer: 1,345,596

2. How many residents does Jacksonville have in 2010?
   - Answer: 1.345.596 (corrected to avoid commas)
