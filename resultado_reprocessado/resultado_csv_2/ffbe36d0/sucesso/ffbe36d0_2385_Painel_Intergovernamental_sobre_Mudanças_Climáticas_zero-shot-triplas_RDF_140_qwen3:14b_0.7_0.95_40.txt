Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs based on the provided context and facts. Let's start by carefully reading through the context and the facts to identify key points.

The context talks about the IPCC, its creation in 1988 by UNEP and WMO, its role in synthesizing climate change research, and its Nobel Peace Prize in 2007. The facts include information about its headquarters in Geneva, its parent organizations (UNEP and WMO), its abbreviation IPCC, and some notable people associated with it.

First, I should list out all the important details that can be turned into questions. Let's see:

1. IPCC was created in 1988 by UNEP and WMO.
2. It's based in Geneva, Switzerland.
3. Its main function is to synthesize and disseminate climate change research.
4. It doesn't conduct original research but summarizes existing work.
5. It has produced five major reports up to 2014.
6. It received the Nobel Peace Prize in 2007.
7. The current chair is Hoesung Lee.
8. Parent organizations are UNEP and WMO.
9. Abbreviation is IPCC.
10. It's part of the United Nations system.
11. Some notable figures associated with IPCC (like Bert Bolin, Filippo Giorgi, etc.).
12. The latest report was in 2014.

Now, I need to ensure that each question is unique and covers different aspects. Let's avoid repetition. For example, I can ask about the creation year, headquarters, function, Nobel Prize, parent organizations, abbreviation, chairperson, number of reports, and maybe a notable person.

Wait, the context mentions that the IPCC has produced five major reports and some other documents. The first in 1990 and the last in 2014. That's a good point for a question.

Also, the facts mention that the current leader is Hoesung Lee, so that's another question.

I need to make sure that each answer is directly from the context or inferable. For example, the Nobel Prize in 2007 is mentioned, so that's a valid answer.

Let me start drafting the questions:

1. When was the IPCC created?
   Answer: 1988.

2. Where is the IPCC headquartered?
   Answer: Geneva, Switzerland.

3. What is the main function of the IPCC?
   Answer: Synthesize and disseminate the most advanced knowledge on climate change, including causes, effects, risks, and solutions.

4. Which organizations co-created the IPCC?
   Answer: United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO).

5. What is the abbreviation for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change?
   Answer: IPCC.

6. In which year did the IPCC receive the Nobel Peace Prize?
   Answer: 2007.

7. Who is the current chair of the IPCC?
   Answer: Hoesung Lee.

8. How many major reports has the IPCC produced as of 2014?
   Answer: Five.

9. What is the primary role of the IPCC in relation to climate change research?
   Answer: To summarize existing research by scientists rather than conducting original research.

10. What are the two parent organizations of the IPCC?
   Answer: United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO).

Wait, question 4 and 10 are similar. Let me check if that's allowed. The user said not to repeat similar questions. So maybe adjust question 10 to ask about the parent organizations, but the answer is the same as question 4. Hmm, that's a problem. Let me rephrase. Instead of asking about the co-creators, maybe ask about the parent organizations, but that's the same as the ones that created it. Alternatively, ask about the parent organizations in the facts section, which are UNEP and WMO. But that's the same as question 4. So perhaps replace question 10 with something else. Maybe the number of reports? Wait, that's already covered in question 8. How about the first report's year? The context says the first report was in 1990. So another question could be: In what year was the first IPCC report published? Answer: 1990.

That would help avoid repetition. Let me adjust:

Replace question 10 with: In what year was the first IPCC report published? Answer: 1990.

So the revised list would be:

1. When was the IPCC created?
2. Where is the IPCC headquartered?
3. What is the main function of the IPCC?
4. Which organizations co-created the IPCC?
5. What is the abbreviation for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change?
6. In which year did the IPCC receive the Nobel Peace Prize?
7. Who is the current chair of the IPCC?
8. How many major reports has the IPCC produced as of 2014?
9. What is the primary role of the IPCC in relation to climate change research?
10. In what year was the first IPCC report published?

That should cover different aspects without repetition. Now, check if all answers are in the context or facts. For example, the first report was in 1990, which is in the context. The current chair is Hoesung Lee, from the facts. The Nobel Prize in 2007 is in the context. The headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland is from the facts. Parent organizations are UNEP and WMO, which are in both context and facts. The abbreviation is IPCC, which is mentioned in the context and facts. The number of reports is five, up to 2014. The role of summarizing existing research is in the context. The main function is synthesizing and disseminating knowledge, as per the context.

I think that covers all the necessary points. Now, I need to ensure that each question is phrased clearly and the answers are concise and accurate.
