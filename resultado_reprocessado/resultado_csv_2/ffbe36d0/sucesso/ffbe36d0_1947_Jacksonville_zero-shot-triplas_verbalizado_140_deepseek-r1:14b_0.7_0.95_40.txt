Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to generate these 10 question-answer pairs based on the given context and facts about Jacksonville, Florida. First, I need to understand what's required. The user wants me to create exactly 10 pairs where each pair has a relevant question and its correct answer, all in Portuguese. I shouldn't add any extra information or explanations—just the JSON structure with the questions and answers.

Looking at the context provided, it's quite detailed about Jacksonville's history, population, notable people born there, sports teams, events like the Super Bowl, geographical features, and more. The facts section lists a lot of specific details, including individuals who were born or died in Jacksonville, organizations based there, sports seasons located in the city, and other points of interest.

I need to make sure each question is unique and covers different aspects of the content. So I should brainstorm various categories: geography, history, population statistics, sports, entertainment, notable people, etc. For example, a question about when Jacksonville was founded, which I know from the context is 1822. Another could be about its population rank in the U.S., which is 12th.

I also need to ensure that each answer is directly supported by the information provided. For instance, the fact that the Super Bowl XLIX (though actually it was XLIX, but wait, looking back, the context says "a 6 de fevereiro de 2005 realizou-se XXXIX Super Bowl no EverBank Field." So that's Super Bowl XXXIX in 2005.

I should also check for any repeated information to avoid similar questions. For example, several facts mention people born in Jacksonville, so I can create a question about famous individuals from there, like Lynyrd Skynyrd or James Ford.

Another point is the precipitation and temperature stats—those could form environmental-related questions. Also, geographical features like the St. Johns River and nearby parks might be good topics for questions.

I need to make sure that each question is clear and directly tied to the facts provided. I'll go through the context and facts systematically, picking out key points that can form a variety of questions. Let's see:

1. When was Jacksonville founded?
2. What rank does Jacksonville hold in U.S. population?
3. Which Super Bowl was hosted there in 2005?
4. Name one famous musician from Jacksonville.
5. What river is central to Jacksonville?
6. Which sports team uses EverBank Field as their stadium?
7. Who was the first permanent European settler in Jacksonville?
8. What's the name of a notable shopping mall in Jacksonville?
9. Where were the Timucua originally located?
10. How much precipitation does Jacksonville get in June?

Wait, I need to make sure these are all correct based on the context. Let me verify each point against the given information.

For example, question 4: Lynyrd Skynyrd is mentioned as originating from Jacksonville, so that's correct. Question 6: The Houston Texans' season was at Jacksonville, but the stadium might be more specific—perhaps EverBank Field? But looking back, several teams are listed as having their stadium in Jacksonville, like the Texans, Colts, etc.

I think I can structure each question to target different aspects without overlap. Now, let me translate these into Portuguese and ensure they're accurate.
