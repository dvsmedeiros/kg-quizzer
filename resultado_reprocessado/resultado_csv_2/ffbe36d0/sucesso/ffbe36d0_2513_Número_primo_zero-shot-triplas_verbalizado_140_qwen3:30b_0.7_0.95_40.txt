Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs based on the given context and facts. Let me start by reading through the context carefully to understand the key points.

The context talks about prime numbers, their definitions, properties, examples, and some related concepts like twin primes, primorials, and historical facts. There are also lists of primes under 1000 and some facts about specific numbers like 2, 3, 5, etc. The facts section mentions various numbers and their prime status, along with templates and images used in a wiki context.

First, I need to make sure each question is relevant and covers different aspects. Let me brainstorm possible questions:

1. What is the definition of a prime number according to the context?
   - The context mentions that a prime number has exactly two distinct natural divisors: 1 and itself. Also, there's a mention of integers and inversible elements, but the main definition is about natural numbers.

2. How many prime numbers are there below 1000?
   - The context states there are 168 primes under 1000, listing some examples.

3. What are twin primes?
   - The context gives examples like (3,5), (5,7), etc., and defines them as pairs differing by 2.

4. What is the only even prime number?
   - The context says "dois" (two) is the only even prime, so the answer is 2.

5. What is the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic?
   - The context mentions that any natural number can be uniquely expressed as a product of primes, called prime factorization.

6. What is a primorial?
   - The context defines p# as the product of all primes up to p, called primorial.

7. Are there infinitely many primes?
   - Yes, Euclid proved it around 300 BC.

8. What is the largest known prime of the form p# + 1?
   - The context mentions 392113# + 1 with 169966 digits, discovered in 2001.

9. What is the largest prime of the form p# - 1?
   - 15877# - 1 with 6845 digits, listed in Caldwell and Gallot's 2002 list.

10. Which primes are listed in the context under 1000?
    - The context lists several primes like 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, etc. But since the user wants unique questions, maybe ask for a specific example.

Wait, but the user wants 10 pairs. Let me check if I have enough unique aspects. Also, need to ensure answers are directly from the context. For example, the question about the only even prime is straightforward. The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic is mentioned. The list of primes under 1000 is given. Twin primes are defined. Primorial is explained. The facts section also has specific numbers like 2, 3, 5, etc., but maybe the questions should be based on the context, not the facts section. However, the facts section is part of the input. Wait, the user included both context and facts. But the instructions say to generate based on the context and facts. But the facts section has entries like "47 (number) possui fatoração Prime number" which might not be as useful for questions. Maybe focus on the context part.

Wait, the user's instruction says "based on the context and facts" but the facts section seems to be more about Wikipedia templates and images. Maybe the main questions should come from the context. Let me focus on the context.

Another possible question: What is the difference between a prime and a composite number? But the context doesn't explicitly state that. However, it mentions that primes have exactly two divisors, which implies composites have more.

Alternatively, the context says "prime number" is a type of "Thing" in the facts. But that might not be as useful.

Another angle: The context mentions that 2, 3, 5, etc., are primes. So a question could be "Which number is the only even prime?" Answer: 2.

Another: "What is the largest prime listed in the context under 1000?" But the context lists many, but maybe the answer is 997? Wait, the context's list includes numbers up to 163, 181, etc., but the exact list isn't fully provided. The context says "the list of primes under 1000" but the actual list is given as examples like 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, etc. However, the exact list in the context is not fully visible, so maybe avoid that.

Alternatively, the question could be about the number of primes under 1000, which is explicitly stated as 168.

Another question: What is the significance of the number 2,147,483,647 in the context? The fact says it has a prime factorization, so the answer is that it's a prime number.

But I need to make sure the answer is directly from the context. Let me check the context again.

Yes, the context mentions "2,147,483,647 possui fatoração Prime number" in the facts. So that's a valid question.

So compiling the 10 questions:

1. Definition of prime.
2. Number of primes under 1000.
3. Twin primes definition.
4. Only even prime.
5. Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic.
6. Primorial definition.
7. Infinitely many primes.
8. Largest prime of form p# + 1.
9. Largest prime of form p# - 1.
10. Example of a prime with a specific property (like 2,147,483,647).

I need to make sure the answers are concise and directly from the context. Also, check for uniqueness. Let me draft each pair.
