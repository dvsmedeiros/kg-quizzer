Okay, let's see. The user wants me to generate 10 question-answer pairs based on the provided context about the 1973 oil crisis. The answers need to be directly from the context, and the questions should cover different aspects without repetition.

First, I'll go through the context again to pick out key points. The crisis started in October 1973 with the OPEC embargo. The embargo targeted nations supporting Israel during the Yom Kippur War, like the US, UK, Japan, etc. The price of oil rose from $3 to $12 by March 1974. It's called the first oil shock, followed by the 1979 crisis. The embargo caused economic and political effects globally.

Now, I need to form questions from these points. Let me list possible questions:

1. When did the 1973 oil crisis start? Answer: October 1973.
2. What was the oil price in March 1974? Answer: Around $12.
3. What was another name for the 1973 crisis? First oil shock.
4. Which organization imposed the embargo? OPEC members.
5. Why were the targeted nations? Because they supported Israel.
6. What was the impact on the US economy? High prices and inflation.
7. What was the outcome of the embargo? Prices rose and caused a crisis.
8. When did the embargo end? March 1974.
9. What was the effect on global politics? Economic and political effects.
10. What was the significance of the 1973 crisis? First major oil shock.

Wait, some of these might be too similar. Need to ensure each question is unique. Let me check the examples given. The examples include questions about the start date, price, another name, embargo proclamers, reasons for separation, Nixon's negotiations, Kissinger's date, embargo lifting, and Bretton Woods. Oh, the Bretton Woods part isn't in the context, so maybe that's from the examples. I should avoid that.

Looking back at the context, there's mention of the embargo's expansion to Portugal, Rhodesia, and South Africa. Also, the price increase, the term "first oil shock," and the 1979 crisis as the second. The embargo's start and end dates are key. Also, the economic effects like inflation and scarcity.

So, possible questions:

1. When did the embargo begin? October 1973.
2. What was the oil price before and after? From $3 to $12.
3. Which countries were initially targeted? Canada, Japan, Netherlands, UK, US.
4. What was another name for the crisis? First oil shock.
5. What caused the embargo? Support for Israel during Yom Kippur War.
6. How did the embargo affect the US? Prices rose sharply.
7. What was the result of the embargo? Global economic crisis.
8. When did the embargo end? March 1974.
9. What were the long-term effects? Political and economic changes.
10. What was the significance of the 1973 crisis? First major oil shock.

Wait, the example includes a question about Nixon's negotiation, which isn't in the context. I need to make sure all answers are based on the given context. Let me cross-verify each question with the context.

The context mentions the embargo's start in October 1973, the price increase to $12 by March 1974, the OPEC members, the countries targeted, the term "first oil shock," and the 1979 crisis as the second. The economic effects include inflation and scarcity. The embargo ended in March 1974. The political effects are mentioned as well.

So, the 10 questions could be:

1. Quando começou o embargo petrolífero? Outubro de 1973.
2. Qual foi o preço do petróleo em março de 1974? Cerca de US$ 12.
3. Quais países foram alvo do embargo inicialmente? Canadá, Japão, Holanda, Reino Unido e Estados Unidos.
4. Qual foi outro nome dado à crise? Primeiro choque do petróleo.
5. Por que os países alvo foram embargados? Por apoiarem Israel durante a Guerra do Yom Kippur.
6. Quais foram os efeitos econômicos da crise? Inflação e escassez de petróleo.
7. Qual foi o resultado do embargo? Crise global de petróleo.
8. Quando o embargo foi levantado? Março de 1974.
9. Quais foram os efeitos políticos da crise? Mudanças políticas e econômicas globais.
10. Qual foi a importância da crise de 1973? Foi o primeiro choque do petróleo, seguido pela crise de 1979.

I need to check for repetition and ensure each question is unique. The examples have similar structure, so I can follow that. The answers must be precise, using the context's exact words. Let me make sure the answers are correctly inferred. For example, the price increase is from $3 to $12, so the answer should reflect that. The embargo expansion includes Portugal, Rhodesia, and South Africa, but the initial countries are the ones mentioned. The term "first oil shock" is used. The example includes a question about Nixon's negotiation, but since that's not in the context, I should avoid similar questions. 

Thus, the 10 questions should cover start date, price changes, initial targets, alternative name, cause, economic effects, embargo end, political effects, significance, and maybe the expansion of the embargo. Let me adjust the questions accordingly.
