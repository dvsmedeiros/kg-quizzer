Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs based on the given context and facts about Warsaw. Let me start by understanding the requirements.

First, the context provides information about Warsaw's history, population, landmarks, cultural aspects, and some facts about its administration. The facts list includes various entities related to Warsaw, like people born or died there, institutions, locations, and other specific data.

The rules say that each pair must have a question and a correct answer, all in Portuguese. The questions should be varied, cover different aspects, and each answer must be explicitly or inferably from the content. No repetition of similar questions.

So, I need to look through the context and facts to find distinct points. Let me go through the context first.

From the context:
- Warsaw is the capital of Poland, on the Vistula River.
- Population in 2012 was 1.7 million.
- It's the capital of the Masovian Voivodeship.
- Industries: consumer goods, steel, electrical engineering, cars.
- Higher education institutions: University of Warsaw, others.
- Cultural aspects: Philharmonic Orchestra, National Theatre, Opera.
- History: dates back to late 13th century, moved capital in 1569, known as "Paris of the North" before WWII.
- WWII destruction, reconstruction, "Phoenix City" title.
- UNESCO World Heritage Site: Historic Center.
- Other facts: Frontex headquarters, ranked 32nd in livability, etc.

Now, the facts list has a lot of specific data, like people born in Warsaw, institutions located there, temperature data, etc.

I need to make sure each question is unique and covers different aspects. Let's brainstorm possible questions.

1. What is the capital of Poland?
   - Answer: Warsaw.

2. What is the population of Warsaw in 2012?
   - Answer: 1,716,855.

3. Which river flows through Warsaw?
   - Answer: Vistula.

4. What is the name of the historic center of Warsaw designated as a UNESCO site?
   - Answer: Historic Center of Warsaw.

5. What was Warsaw known as before WWII?
   - Answer: "Paris of the North".

6. What is the name of the largest theatre in Warsaw?
   - Answer: National Theatre.

7. Which university is located in Warsaw?
   - Answer: University of Warsaw.

8. What is the highest temperature recorded in Warsaw in April?
   - Answer: 30.4°C.

9. What is the time zone of Warsaw?
   - Answer: UTC +2.

10. What is the name of the bridge in Warsaw called Śląsko-Dąbrowski Bridge?
    - Answer: Śląsko-Dąbrowski Bridge.

Wait, but the facts list has specific entries. Let me check if these answers are in the context or facts.

For example, the time zone is mentioned in the facts: "Warsaw possui deslocamento UTC +2". So that's valid.

The highest temperature in April is in the facts: "Warsaw possui recorde de temperatura alta em abril (°C) 30.4".

The Śląsko-Dąbrowski Bridge is mentioned in the facts: "Śląsko-Dąbrowski Bridge possui localidade Warsaw".

But the question about the bridge's name is straightforward.

Another point: the Historic Center is mentioned in the context as a UNESCO site.

The population in 2012 is in the context.

The Vistula River is mentioned in the context.

The "Paris of the North" is in the context.

The National Theatre is mentioned as the largest.

The University of Warsaw is in the context.

The time zone is in the facts.

The highest temperature in April is in the facts.

Another possible question: What is the name of the bridge in Warsaw? But the facts list the bridge's name, so the answer would be Śląsko-Dąbrowski Bridge.

Alternatively, maybe the question about the highest temperature in April is better.

I need to ensure that each answer is directly from the context or facts. Let me check each answer against the provided data.

Yes, all the answers I thought of are present in either the context or the facts.

Now, I need to make sure that the questions are varied and not repetitive. Let me check if any of the questions are similar. For example, asking about the capital and the population are different aspects.

Another possible question: What is the name of the organization that is the European border agency based in Warsaw? Answer: Frontex.

But the context says "Varsóvia é a sede da Frontex, a guarda de fronteira europeia e a agência costeira." So that's a valid question.

But I already have 10. Let me list them:

1. Capital of Poland: Warsaw.

2. Population in 2012: 1,716,855.

3. River: Vistula.

4. UNESCO site: Historic Center.

5. Nickname before WWII: "Paris of the North".

6. Largest theatre: National Theatre.

7. University: University of Warsaw.

8. Highest April temperature: 30.4°C.

9. Time zone: UTC+2.

10. Bridge name: Śląsko-Dąbrowski Bridge.

That's 10. Let me check if these are all unique and cover different aspects. Yes, each is different. Now, I need to phrase them as questions in Portuguese.

For example:

- "Qual é a capital da Polônia?" (Answer: Varsóvia)

- "Qual era a população de Varsóvia em 2012?" (Answer: 1.716.855)

- "Qual rio atravessa Varsóvia?" (Answer: Vístula)

- "Qual é o nome do centro histórico de Varsóvia, considerado Patrimônio da Humanidade?" (Answer: Centro Histórico de Varsóvia)

- "Como era conhecida Varsóvia antes da Segunda Guerra Mundial?" (Answer: "Paris da Noruega" — but the context says "Paris of the North", so in Portuguese, "Paris do Norte")

- "Qual é o nome do maior teatro de Varsóvia?" (Answer: Teatro Nacional)

- "Qual universidade está localizada em Varsóvia?" (Answer: Universidade de Varsóvia)

- "Qual é a temperatura máxima registrada em Varsóvia em abril?" (Answer: 30,4°C)

- "Qual é o fuso horário de Varsóvia?" (Answer: UTC+2)

- "Qual é o nome da ponte em Varsóvia chamada Śląsko-Dąbrowski Bridge?" (Answer: Ponte Śląsko-Dąbrowski)

Wait, but in the facts, it's "Śląsko-Dąbrowski Bridge possui localidade Warsaw", so the answer is Śląsko-Dąbrowski Bridge. But in Portuguese, should I keep the original name or translate? Probably keep the original name as it's a proper noun.

So the answer would be "Ponte Śląsko-Dąbrowski".

But maybe the question is better phrased as "Qual é o nome da ponte em Varsóvia?" and the answer is "Ponte Śląsko-Dąbrowski".

I think that's acceptable.

Now, compiling all these into the required format.
