Okay, so I need to create 10 question-answer pairs based on the data provided about Warsaw. The user has already given some examples, but I should make sure my questions are different and cover various aspects of the information provided.

First, I'll look through all the triples to identify key points. There's a lot here: geographical info, notable people born or died in Warsaw, institutions based there, historical events, climate data, etc. 

Let me start by identifying categories:

1. **Geographical and Administrative Information**: Warsaw is a city county, its UTC offset, subdivisions.
2. **Climate Data**: Average temperatures, record highs/lows for specific months.
3. **Notable Residents**: People born or died in Warsaw, including historical figures, artists, scientists.
4. **Institutions and Organizations**: Universities, museums, government ministries located in Warsaw.
5. **Historical Events**: The Warsaw Ghetto, Warsaw Voivodeship, etc.

Now, I'll brainstorm questions for each category:

1. What is the administrative subdivision of Warsaw?
2. What is Warsaw's UTC offset?
3. What was the average temperature in May in Warsaw?
4. Who were some notable people born in Warsaw?
5. Which universities are located in Warsaw?
6. What historical events are associated with Warsaw?
7. What climate records does Warsaw hold for April?
8. Which government ministries are based in Warsaw?
9. What museums are present in Warsaw?
10. What was the temperature range like in December in Warsaw?

I need to ensure each question is clear and directly relates to a specific piece of information from the triples. I'll avoid repeating the examples given by the user, so I'll focus on different aspects.

For example, for the climate data, instead of asking about April's average low, maybe ask about the record high or something else. Similarly, for notable residents, perhaps include someone not mentioned before.

I should also consider varying the types of questions: some factual, others more about significance or history.

Let me draft each question and then find the corresponding answer from the data:

1. What is Warsaw's subdivision name?
   - Answer: City county

2. What was Warsaw's average temperature in May?
   - 14.8°C

3. Who are some notable people born in Warsaw?
   - Examples include Yehudit Hendel, Zbigniew Brzezinski, etc.

4. Which university is located in Warsaw?
   - University of Warsaw

5. What historical event is associated with Warsaw?
   - The Warsaw Ghetto during WWII.

6. What was the record high temperature in April in Warsaw?
   - 30.4°C

7. Which government ministries are based in Warsaw?
   - Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Public Security, etc.

8. What museums are present in Warsaw?
   - Museum of John Paul II Collection

9. What is Warsaw's UTC offset?
   - +2 hours

10. What was the temperature range in December?
    - High of 2.7°C

I think these cover a good range of information without overlapping too much with the initial examples. Each question targets specific data points, ensuring clarity and accuracy.
