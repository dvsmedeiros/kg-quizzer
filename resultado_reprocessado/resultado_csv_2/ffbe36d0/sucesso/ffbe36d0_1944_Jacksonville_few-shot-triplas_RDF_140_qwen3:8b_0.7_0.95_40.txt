Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs about Jacksonville, Florida, based on the provided data. Let me start by reviewing the information given.

First, the examples show that the questions should be in Portuguese, and the answers should be concise, using the data from the RDF triples. The examples include questions about population, ranking, counties, rivers, historical sites, etc. 

Looking at the data, there's a lot of information. Let me extract key points:

- Population: The data mentions "populationMetro" as 1,733,937 and "populationRank" as 12. Also, there's a mention of "population" as 1,345,596 in the example, which might refer to 2010 data. Wait, the user's example includes a question about the 2010 population with the answer "1.345.596". So maybe the "population" field here is for the current population, and the example's answer is historical. I need to be careful here. The current data in the triples has "populationMetro" as 1,733,937, which is the metro area population. The example's answer for the 2010 population is 1,345,596. So maybe the current population is higher, but the example is using a specific historical data point. However, the user's example might have that data from another source. Since the data here doesn't include the 2010 population, perhaps I should avoid that unless there's a way to get that info. Wait, the user's example has that, but in the current data provided, the "populationMetro" is 1,733,937. Maybe the example is using a different dataset. Since the user's examples are provided, I should follow them. So in the data, the "populationMetro" is the current metro population, and the example's answer is for 2010. But since the current data doesn't have the 2010 figure, maybe I should not include that unless there's a way to infer it. Alternatively, perhaps the user's examples are not directly from the current data but from other sources. Since the user provided the examples, I should follow their structure but use the data from the given triples. 

Wait, the user provided the data with "populationMetro" as 1,733,937 and "populationRank" as 12. The example includes a question about the 2010 population with the answer 1,345,596. So maybe that's a separate data point. Since the current data doesn't have the 2010 population, I should avoid that. However, the user's examples include that, so maybe I should still include it if possible. Alternatively, perhaps the user wants me to use the data from the triples. Let me check the data again.

Looking at the data, there's a line: "populationMetro" "1733937" and "populationRank" "12". The example has a question about 2010 population with answer 1,345,596. Since the current data doesn't have that, maybe the user's example is using a different dataset. But I need to follow the user's examples. So perhaps in the generated answers, I should use the data from the triples. For example, the current population is 1,733,937, and the rank is 12. 

Now, looking at the examples, they also include questions about the river (St. Johns), the county (Duval), the historical colony (Fort Caroline), and the native people (Timucua). The data includes "St. Johns" as the river, and the county is Duval. The historical colony is Fort Caroline, and the Timucua are the indigenous people. 

Other data points from the triples include:
- "establishedTitle" "Founded" (maybe the founding year, but the example mentions Andrew Jackson's name, so perhaps the city was named after him in 1822. Wait, the example's answer is "Andrew Jackson," which is the historical figure. The data has "establishedTitle" as "Founded" but no specific year. However, the example's question about the historical figure is answered with Andrew Jackson, so that's a key point. 

Other data points: 
- "febLowF" "46.1" (February low temperature)
- "junPrecipitationInch" "7.6" (June precipitation in inches)
- "mayAvgRecordLowF" "50.7" (May average record low)
- "populationDensityKm" "490.63" (population density in km²)
- "wikiPageUsesTemplate" (templates used on Wikipedia)
- "foaf:depiction" (images)
- "skos:exactMatch" (exact match to a Global WordNet ID)
- "foaf:nick" (nicknames like "Jax", "The River City", etc.)

Now, I need to create 10 question-answer pairs. Let me think of possible questions based on the data:

1. What is the nickname of Jacksonville?
   - "Jax", "The River City", The Bold New City of the South"

2. Which river flows through Jacksonville?
   - St. Johns

3. What is the population of Jacksonville?
   - 1,733,937 (metro area) or 1,345,596 (as per example, but need to check if that's in the data. Wait, the data has "populationMetro" as 1,733,937. The example's answer is 1,345,596 for 2010. Since the data doesn't have that, maybe the example is using another source, but I should use the data given. So the current population is 1,733,937.

4. What is the population rank of Jacksonville in the US?
   - 12th

5. Which county does Jacksonville belong to?
   - Duval

6. What is the name of the historical French colony founded in 1564?
   - Fort Caroline

7. Which indigenous group inhabited the area before the French arrived?
   - Timucua

8. What is the name of the historical figure after whom Jacksonville was named?
   - Andrew Jackson

9. What is the population density of Jacksonville?
   - 490.63 per km²

10. What is the average low temperature in February?
    - 46.1°F

Wait, the example includes a question about the distance between Jacksonville and Miami, but the data doesn't have that. The user's examples include that, but the data here doesn't have that info. So maybe I should avoid that unless there's a way to infer it. However, the user's examples have that, but the data provided here doesn't have it. So perhaps I should not include that unless I can find the data. Alternatively, the user's example might be using other data, but since the current data doesn't have it, I should not include that. 

So, the 10 questions would be based on the available data. Let me structure them in Portuguese, following the examples. 

Also, note that the example answers are in Portuguese, but the user provided the examples in Portuguese. Wait, no: looking back, the examples have "pergunta" and "resposta" in Portuguese. For example, the first example is:

{
  "pergunta": "Qual cidade da Flórida tem a maior população?",
  "resposta": "Jacksonville"
}

So the questions and answers should be in Portuguese. 

Now, translating the questions and answers accordingly. Let me make sure each answer is accurate based on the data.

1. Qual é o apelido de Jacksonville?
   - "Jax", "A Cidade do Rio", "A Nova Cidade Corajosa do Sul"

Wait, the "foaf:nick" has multiple values: "\"Jax\", \"The River City\", The Bold New City of the South". So the answer could list all nicknames.

2. Qual rio corre ao lado de Jacksonville?
   - St. Johns

3. Qual é a população de Jacksonville?
   - 1.733.937 (metro)

4. Qual é o ranking de Jacksonville nos Estados Unidos em termos de população?
   - 12ª

5. Em que condado reside Jacksonville?
   - Duval

6. Qual é o nome da colônia francesa fundada em 1564?
   - Fort Caroline

7. Quem habitava a área antes da chegada dos franceses?
   - o Timucua

8. Qual figura histórica recebeu o nome de Jacksonville?
   - Andrew Jackson

9. Qual é a densidade populacional de Jacksonville?
   - 490,63 por km²

10. Qual é a temperatura média mínima em fevereiro?
    - 46,1 °F

Wait, the example's answer for the population is "1.345.596" for 2010. However, in the data provided, "populationMetro" is 1,733,937. The user's example might be using a different dataset. Since the user's examples are provided, but the current data doesn't have that, perhaps I should stick to the current data. However, in the examples, they include that 2010 population. But the data here doesn't have that. So maybe I should avoid that unless I can find it. 

Alternatively, the user might have provided the data, and the examples are just examples. So I should use the data given. Therefore, the answers would be based on the data provided. 

So, the 10 questions would be as above. Now, I need to make sure that the answers are in Portuguese and correctly formatted. Also, check for any other data points. 

Another data point is the temperature in June: "junPrecipitationInch" "7.6" (inches of precipitation). But the example's question about the distance isn't covered here. 

So, the 10 questions are as listed. Let me check again if there's any other data. The "establishedTitle" is "Founded", which might refer to the founding year. However, the example's answer about the historical figure is Andrew Jackson, which might be the reason the city was named after him in 1822. But the data doesn't specify the year. 

Therefore, the 10 questions are as above. Now, translating them properly into Portuguese. Also, the temperature in May is "50.7" (average record low in May). Maybe another question about that. 

So perhaps:

10. Qual é a temperatura média mínima em maio?
   - 50,7 °F

But the user's examples don't include that. However, the data has that. So maybe adding that as a question. 

Alternatively, the user's examples have 10 questions, but the current data may not have enough. Let me check again:

The data includes:
- populationMetro: 1,733,937
- populationRank: 12
- St. Johns river
- Duval county
- Fort Caroline (colony)
- Timucua (indigenous people)
- Andrew Jackson (named after)
- February low temp: 46.1
- June precipitation: 7.6
- May average record low: 50.7
- population density: 490.63
- nicknames: "Jax", "The River City", "The Bold New City of the South"

So, possible questions:

1. Qual é o apelido de Jacksonville?
   - "Jax", "A Cidade do Rio", "A Nova Cidade Corajosa do Sul"

2. Qual rio corre ao lado de Jacksonville?
   - Rio St. Johns

3. Qual é a população de Jacksonville?
   - 1.733.937 (área metropolitana)

4. Qual é o ranking de Jacksonville nos Estados Unidos em termos de população?
   - 12º

5. Em que condado reside Jacksonville?
   - Condado de Duval

6. Qual é o nome da colônia francesa fundada em 1564?
   - Fort Caroline

7. Quem habitava a área antes da chegada dos franceses?
   - O povo Timucua

8. Qual figura histórica recebeu o nome de Jacksonville?
   - Andrew Jackson

9. Qual é a densidade populacional de Jacksonville?
   - 490,63 por km²

10. Qual é a temperatura média mínima em fevereiro?
    - 46,1 °F

That's 10 questions. Let me check if all answers are correct. For example, the population is given as 1,733,937, which is the metro area. The answer for the 2010 population is in the example but not in the data. So I should avoid that. The other data points are covered. 

Another possible question: What is the average precipitation in June? But the user's examples don't include that. However, the data has "junPrecipitationInch" as 7.6. So adding that as question 11, but I need to stick to 10. 

Alternatively, the user's examples have 10 questions, so maybe that's acceptable. 

So the final 10 questions are as listed above.
