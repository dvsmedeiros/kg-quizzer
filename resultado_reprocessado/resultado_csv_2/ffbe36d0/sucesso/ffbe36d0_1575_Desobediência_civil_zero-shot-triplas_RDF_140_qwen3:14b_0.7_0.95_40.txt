Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants 10 question-answer pairs based on the provided context and facts. First, I need to make sure I understand the context. The main topic here is civil disobedience, its origins with Thoreau, Gandhi, and MLK, and its application in various protests.

Looking at the facts, there's a lot of data from DBpedia about different events and people associated with civil disobedience. The key is to extract relevant information from both the context and the facts without adding anything extra.

First, I should identify the main points from the context. The definition of civil disobedience, its purpose (protest against unjust orders), and the historical figures involved. Then, from the facts, there are specific events and people linked to civil disobedience. For example, Henry David Thoreau is noted as the one who formulated the concept, and various protests like the 1998 Russian miners' strike and the 2015 Montenegrin crisis used civil disobedience.

I need to ensure that each question is unique and covers different aspects. Possible angles: who introduced the concept, historical applications, examples of events that used it, rights of the population when a government is unjust, and maybe some specific instances from the facts.

Let me start listing possible questions:

1. Quem formulou o conceito de desobediência civil?
   Resposta: Henry David Thoreau.

2. Quais são exemplos históricos de desobediência civil?
   Resposta: Movimento dos direitos civis liderado por Martin Luther King e a luta pela independência da Índia liderada por Mahatma Gandhi.

Wait, but the context mentions both Gandhi and MLK. Maybe split that into two questions. However, the user wants 10 pairs, so I need to be careful not to repeat similar questions.

Another angle: the rights of the population when the government is unjust. The context says they have the right to disobey. That could be a question.

Then, looking at the facts, there are specific events. For example, the 2017 Serbian protests used civil disobedience. So a question could be: Qual movimento de 2017 na Sérvia utilizou a desobediência civil?

But I need to check if the facts mention that. Yes, the 2017 Serbian protests are listed. So that's a valid question.

Also, the fact that Henry David Thoreau is associated with the concept. Maybe a question about who is linked to the idea of civil disobedience.

Other events: 2019 Montenegrin anti-corruption protests, 2021 End SARS memorial protest, etc.

I need to ensure that each question is distinct. Maybe some about the definition, historical figures, specific events, and the rights mentioned in the context.

Also, the fact that the concept is applied in various protests, so a question about which movement used it.

Let me structure this step by step:

1. Origin of the concept: Thoreau.
2. Historical applications: Gandhi, MLK.
3. Right of population when government is unjust: they have the right to disobey.
4. Specific events from the facts: e.g., 1998 Russian miners' strike, 2015 Montenegrin crisis, etc.
5. Organizations or groups associated with civil disobedience, like Ruckus Society.
6. People associated with civil disobedience, like Veliyankode Umar Khasi.
7. Movements that used civil disobedience, like the Citizenship Amendment Act protests in Uttar Pradesh.
8. Other events, like the 2022 Kazakh unrest.
9. The role of direct action in civil disobedience (from the categories).
10. The purpose of civil disobedience (as mentioned in the context).

Now, making sure that each answer is directly from the context or the facts provided. Also, avoiding repetition. For example, not asking about Gandhi and MLK in two similar ways.

Also, the fact that the 2017 Albanian opposition protest used civil disobedience. So that's another event.

I need to pick 10 different ones. Let's check the facts again for more events:

- 1998 Russian miners' strike
- 2015–2016 Montenegrin crisis
- 2017 Albanian opposition protest
- 2017 Serbian protests
- 2017 St. Louis protests
- 2018–2019 Iranian protests
- 2019 Montenegrin anti-corruption protests
- 2019–2020 clerical protests in Montenegro
- 2021 End SARS memorial protest
- 2021 Montenegrin Episcopal enthronement protests
- 2021 Uptown Minneapolis unrest
- 2022 Kazakh unrest
- Aboriginal Tent Embassy
- Assam Movement
- August 2020 LGBT protests in Poland
- Billy Hughes egg-throwing incident
- Citizenship Amendment Act protests in Uttar Pradesh
- Civil disobedience Wikipedia page
- Women in the Yellow Vests movement
- Women Disobey

That's a lot of events. So I can pick 10 from these. Also, the historical figures: Thoreau, Gandhi, MLK, and maybe others from the facts like Tony Milligan, Veliyankode Umar Khasi.

But the user wants 10 pairs. Let's ensure each question is unique and covers different aspects. For example:

1. Origin (Thoreau)
2. Right of population (context)
3. Historical application (Gandhi and MLK)
4. Specific event (1998 Russian miners)
5. Another event (2015 Montenegrin crisis)
6. Another event (2021 End SARS)
7. Organization (Ruckus Society)
8. Person (Veliyankode Umar Khasi)
9. Movement (Citizenship Amendment Act protests)
10. Event (Women in the Yellow Vests)

That should cover different aspects. Now, phrasing the questions and answers accordingly, making sure to use the exact information from the context and facts.
