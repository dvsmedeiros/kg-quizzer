Okay, so I'm trying to create a list of 10 question-answer pairs based on the provided data about steam engines. Let me go through this step by step.

First, I'll look at the examples given to understand the pattern. The questions are in Portuguese and the answers are short, often single words or phrases. They cover various aspects like inventors, components, processes, and types of steam engines.

Looking at the data provided, it's a RDF graph with information about steam engines and related entities. There are mentions of several inventors like Thomas Newcomen and James Watt, as well as terms like "combustão externa" (external combustion), "bomba de vapor" (steam pump), and different types of steam engines such as "motor rotativo" and "móvel".

I'll start by identifying key points from the data:

1. **Inventors**: Thomas Newcomen invented the atmospheric engine in 1712, and James Watt improved it later.
2. **Components**: The steam engine has components like pistão (piston), válvulas (valves).
3. **Types of Engines**: There are different types such as stationary engines used in factories, locomotives for trains, and marine engines for ships.
4. **Applications**: Steam engines were used in various applications including pumping water from mines, powering locomotives, and ships.

Now, I'll form questions around these points:

1. **Who invented the atmospheric engine?**
   - Answer: Thomas Newcomen

2. **When was the atmospheric engine invented?**
   - Answer: 1712

3. **What improvement did James Watt make to the steam engine?**
   - Answer: He made it more efficient.

4. **What is a component of a steam engine?**
   - Answer: Piston

5. **What type of combustion does a steam engine use?**
   - Answer: Combustão externa

6. **What was one of the first applications of the steam engine?**
   - Answer: Pumping water from mines

7. **What is another name for a stationary steam engine used in factories?**
   - Answer: Motor fixo

8. **What type of steam engine is used in trains?**
   - Answer: Locomotivas

9. **What was the purpose of early steam engines before widespread use in transportation?**
   - Answer: Pumping water and powering machinery

10. **Who improved the steam engine by adding a separate condenser?**
    - Answer: James Watt

I think these cover various aspects from the data, ensuring each answer is concise and directly related to the question.
