Okay, so I need to create 10 question and answer pairs about Warsaw based on the provided context. Let me start by understanding what information is given in the context.

The context mentions that Warsaw is the capital of Poland, located along the Vistula River. It's known as the cultural, political, and economic center of the country. The Old Town, a UNESCO World Heritage site with historical architecture like St. John’s Cathedral and the Royal Castle, is highlighted. There are also modern attractions such as the Museum of Contemporary Art and the Warsaw University of Technology. The city has a rich history, including being a hub for uprisings during the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth era.

Now, I need to make sure each question covers different aspects. Let me list possible topics: location (capital, river), notable areas (Old Town, UNESCO status), historical buildings and institutions, modern attractions, population stats, economic aspects, political aspects, cultural aspects, educational institutions, transport infrastructure, and historical significance like uprisings.

I should avoid repeating similar questions and ensure each has a clear correct answer from the context. Let me draft some:

1. What is Warsaw's status as a city? – It's the capital.
2. Which river is it on? – Vistula.
3. Name two main areas of importance. – Old Town, Royal Castle.
4. Why is Old Town significant? – UNESCO site with historical buildings.
5. What modern attractions exist there? – Museum of Contemporary Art and University.
6. How does its economy compare regionally? – Largest in Poland.
7. What was Warsaw known for historically? – Center of uprisings.
8. Any other notable landmarks besides the ones mentioned? – Maybe the market square or another building, but context doesn't specify, so perhaps a different angle.
9. Population details? – Context says around 1.7 million in the city and over 3 million in metro area.
10. Another aspect like transport: Does it have an efficient system?

Wait, the context mentions "efficient public transport," so that's another point.

Let me adjust to cover all topics without overlap:

1. What is Warsaw? – Capital of Poland.
2. Which river does it lie on? – Vistula.
3. What’s a key historical area? – Old Town with Royal Castle and St. John’s Cathedral.
4. Why is the Old Town significant? – UNESCO site, well-preserved architecture.
5. Name two modern attractions. – Museum of Contemporary Art, Warsaw University of Technology.
6. How does Warsaw's economy rank in Poland? – Largest.
7. What was Warsaw historically known for? – Center of uprisings during Commonwealth.
8. What is the population of Warsaw? – Around 1.7 million.
9. What kind of transport system does it have? – Efficient public transport.
10. Name a cultural aspect – It's Poland's cultural center.

I need to phrase these as questions and ensure each has one correct answer from the context. Let me write them out clearly, making sure each is unique and covers different aspects without overlap.
