Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs based on the provided context and facts about Warsaw. Let me start by carefully reading through both sections to identify key points that can form the basis of these questions.

First, looking at the context, Warsaw is the capital of Poland, located on the Vistula River. It's the largest city with a population of over 1.7 million in 2012. The city has a rich history dating back to the late 13th century and was significantly affected during World War II but was rebuilt afterwards. Notable landmarks include the Old Town, which is a UNESCO site, and places like the Column of Sigismund.

The facts provided list many individuals who were born or died in Warsaw, institutions located there, and other specific details about events and structures related to the city. For example, Cymburgis of Masovia was born in Warsaw, and the University of Warsaw is situated there.

I need to create varied questions that cover different aspects: history, culture, geography, notable people, economy, etc. Each question should have a clear answer based on the content provided.

Starting with easy ones:
1. What river flows through Warsaw? Answer: Vistula River.
2. When was Warsaw rebuilt after WWII? The context mentions it was completely reconstructed after the war, but the exact date isn't given. However, I can note that it was after 1945.

Looking at the facts, there are many people born in Warsaw. So another question could be about a notable person born there, like Zbigniew Brzezinski or someone else mentioned.

Another angle is institutions: which university is in Warsaw? That's the University of Warsaw.

For temperatures, the facts mention April's min and max temps, so a question about that would fit.

Warsaw has landmarks like the Column of Sigismund, so a question about major attractions could include that.

I should also cover events, such as the Warsaw Uprising in 1944, but that might be too historical. Alternatively, using the fact about the Phoenix City nickname because of its reconstruction.

Looking at the structure, I'll need to ensure each question is unique and covers different areas without repetition.

Potential questions:
- What river flows through Warsaw?
- Which university is located in Warsaw?
- Who was a notable person born in Warsaw?
- What is Warsaw's nickname due to its history?
- Where is the headquarters of Frontex located?
- What landmark is part of Warsaw's Old Town?
- What's Warsaw's temperature range in April?

I need to make sure each question has one correct answer and that I don't repeat similar questions. Also, ensure all answers are clearly supported by the provided context or facts.

Let me list out possible questions and their answers based on this analysis.
