Okay, I need to generate 10 pairs of questions and answers based on the provided context and facts. Let me start by understanding the context and the facts given.

The context explains the historical origin of schools, mentioning that the word originally meant "discussion or conference" and also "leisure or idleness," where people could have educational conversations. Now, schools are formal institutions for teaching students under teachers' guidance, with most countries having mandatory education systems. The levels include primary and secondary, with higher education in universities or colleges.

The facts list numerous schools, all labeled as "Private school." So, the key points are the definition of a school, its historical meaning, current purpose, education levels, and the fact that many listed institutions are private.

Now, I need to create varied questions that cover different aspects of the context and facts. Let's brainstorm possible questions.

1. What is the historical meaning of the word "school"?
   - Answer: "Discussion or conference" and "leisure or idleness."

2. What is the primary function of a school today?
   - Answer: An institution for teaching students under the direction of teachers.

3. Which education levels are typically included in formal school systems?
   - Answer: Primary (fundamental) and secondary (high school).

4. What is the term for an institution that provides higher education?
   - Answer: University or college.

5. What is the common term for a school that provides higher education?
   - Answer: University or college.

Wait, that's similar to question 4. Need to avoid repetition. Maybe rephrase.

6. What is the term for the time in the historical context where people had educational conversations?
   - Answer: Leisure or idleness.

7. Are the listed schools public or private?
   - Answer: Private.

8. What is the name of the institution where higher education is taught?
   - Answer: University or college.

Again, similar to question 4. Hmm. Maybe focus on the facts more. Since all the listed schools are private, perhaps ask about their common characteristic.

9. What is the common characteristic of the listed schools?
   - Answer: They are all private schools.

10. What is the typical progression in formal education systems?
    - Answer: Through a series of levels, such as primary and secondary education.

That seems good. Let me check if these cover different aspects without repetition. The first few questions are about the historical meaning, current function, education levels, and higher education institutions. The last ones are about the listed schools being private and the progression in education.

I need to ensure each question is unique and based on the context. Let me make sure each answer is directly from the context or facts. Also, check that there are exactly 10 pairs and they are in JSON format.
