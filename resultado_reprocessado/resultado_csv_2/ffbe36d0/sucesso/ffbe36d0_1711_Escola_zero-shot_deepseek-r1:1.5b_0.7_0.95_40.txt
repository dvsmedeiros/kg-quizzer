Okay, I need to create 10 objective questions based on the provided context, which is a list of animals and their names. Each question should have a unique answer that's either explicit or inferred directly from the text. 

First, I'll review each animal and think of a relevant question for each. Let me go through them one by one.

1. **Rhesus**: The name comes from Greek "rhézos," meaning warm, cozy.
2. **Giraffe**: The word " Giraffa" is derived from the German word “GirAFFA,” which also means "giant’s head."
3. **Tiger**: I know it's derived from "tigeris," the Latin for "tiger," but that's not entirely accurate.
4. **Hippopotamus**: The name comes from Greek "hieppotámos," meaning “headless,” referring to its large head.
5. **Eagle**: It originates from "eagles," a diminutive of "eag" in Old English, which means "bird."
6. **Lion**: The name is derived from the Latin word "lunis," meaning "lion's head."
7. **Elephant**: I recall it's from the German word “elephant,” meaning “large horse.”
8. **Giraffe**: Wait, that's already a separate question.
9. **Tiger**: Let me think again. Maybe it comes from the Greek word for "giant’s head."
10. **Hippopotamus**: Perhaps from the Greek word for "headless."

Wait, I just realized that some questions might be repeating names or similar meanings. For example, both the giraffe and lion have meanings related to their heads. Should I combine those into a single question? The user wants 10 unique perigees, so maybe it's better to keep them separate but ensure each has a clear answer.

Let me adjust:

1. **Rhesus**: Origin from Greek rhézos.
2. **Giraffe**: Derivation from German Giraffa.
3. **Tiger**: From Greek hieppotámos.
4. **Hippopotamus**: From Greek hieppotámos, but wait, that's the same as tiger? Hmm, maybe I should correct that to refer to a different animal or ensure uniqueness.

Perhaps I made an error with the hippopotamus. Let me check: The correct origin is from Greek hieppotámos, meaning "giant’s head," which fits perfectly.

Wait, but in the context of 10 unique questions, maybe each animal can have its own distinct question. So perhaps:

1. Rhesus: From Greek rhézos.
2. Giraffe: Derivation from German Giraffa.
3. Tiger: Origin from Greek hieppotámos.
4. Hippopotamus: Origin from Greek hieppotámos, meaning "giant’s head."
5. Eagle: Derived from eagles, a diminutive of eag in Old English, meaning "bird."
6. Lion: Derivation from Latin lionis, meaning "big head."
7. Elephant: From the German word “elephant,” meaning “large horse.”
8. Panda: Origin from Chinese Panda, known as the Red Panda.
9. Hyena: From Greek hyena, meaning "eagle-like bird," which is actually a different animal. Maybe I should correct that to ensure uniqueness.

Wait, hyena and eagle are different animals. So I'll keep them separate.

10. Hundred leopards: The name comes from the Greek word for hundred leopards, which was used in ancient times.
  
But wait, the user has already provided 10 options, so maybe I need to adjust based on their given context. Let me ensure each is unique and correct.

Finalizing:
