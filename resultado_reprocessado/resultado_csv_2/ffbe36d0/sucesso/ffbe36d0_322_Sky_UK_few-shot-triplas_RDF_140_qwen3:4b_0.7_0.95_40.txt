Okay, I need to generate 10 objective questions and answers based on the provided context and facts about British Satellite Broadcasting (BSB). Let me start by carefully reading the context and facts again to make sure I understand all the key points.

The context says that BSB was a UK-based television company that provided direct satellite TV services. It was incorporated in November 1990 to form BSkyB, and it started transmitting on March 25, 1990. The facts include some RDF triples that mention BSB's role in various TV channels and films, its founding year, location, successor, and merger with Sky Television to form BSkyB.

The user provided examples of questions, so I should avoid repeating similar ones. The questions should cover different aspects: founding date, location, merger, services, channels, and possibly the successor company.

First, I need to ensure that each question is unique and covers different aspects. Let me list possible topics:

1. Founding year of BSB
2. Location of BSB
3. When BSB started transmitting
4. The year BSB was incorporated
5. The company that BSB merged with to form BSkyB
6. The successor company of BSB
7. The location of the headquarters (Marco Polo House)
8. The name of the company after the merger
9. The year BSB was established
10. The role of BSB in the UK TV industry

Now, I need to check the facts again. The facts mention that BSB was incorporated in November 1990, but started transmitting in 1990. The founding date is 1986-12-11, so that's when it was established. The successor is Sky UK. The merger was with Sky Television to form BSkyB. The location is London, England, and Marco Polo House. The name after merger is BSkyB.

I need to make sure the answers are accurate. For example, the founding year is 1986, but incorporated in 1990. The answer for the year BSB was established is 1986. The incorporation date is November 1990, but the start of transmission is March 25, 1990.

I need to avoid any questions that are similar to the examples. The examples included questions about the merger, successor, founding year, etc. So I need to make sure the questions are different but still based on the given facts.

Let me draft the questions:

1. Em que ano a British Satellite Broadcasting foi estabelecida?
2. Em que cidade a British Satellite Broadcasting tinha sua sede?
3. Quando a British Satellite Broadcasting começou a transmitir?
4. Em que ano a British Satellite Broadcasting foi incorporada?
5. Quais empresas se uniram para formar a British Sky Broadcasting?
6. Qual é a empresa sucessora da British Satellite Broadcasting?
7. Onde estava localizada a sede da British Satellite Broadcasting?
8. Qual é o nome da empresa formada pela fusão da British Satellite Broadcasting e da Sky Television?
9. Em que ano a British Satellite Broadcasting foi fundada?
10. Qual é o nome da holding do BSkyB?

Wait, the example already has a question about the holding, but maybe that's okay. However, the user's example had "Sky plc" as the holding. But in the context, the BSkyB is part of Sky plc. So maybe that's correct.

But I need to check the facts. The facts mention that BSB is a company, and BSkyB is formed by the merger. The successor is Sky UK. The holding is Sky plc. So the answer for the holding would be Sky plc.

I need to make sure each question is unique. Let me check again:

1. Founding year (1986)
2. City (London)
3. Start transmission date (March 25, 1990)
4. Incorporation year (1990)
5. Merged with Sky Television
6. Successor is Sky UK
7. Location (Marco Polo House)
8. Name of the merged company (BSkyB)
9. Founded in 1986 (same as 1)
10. Holding company is Sky plc

Wait, question 9 is the same as 1. So I need to avoid that. Maybe rephrase. Alternatively, maybe the answer is the same, but the question is different. However, the user's example had a question about the holding, so that's okay.

Wait, the user's example had a question about the holding, but in the facts, the BSB is a company that was incorporated in November 1990 to form BSkyB, which is part of Sky plc. So the holding company is Sky plc.

So, the answer for question 10 would be Sky plc.

But the user's example has a question about the holding, so maybe that's acceptable.

Now, I need to make sure that each question is based on the facts provided. Let me check each point again.

Yes, all the questions are based on the facts given. Now, I need to structure them in Portuguese, ensuring that the answers are correct and that each question is unique and covers different aspects.

Let me check again the facts:

- Founded in 1986 (founding date: 1986-12-11)
- Incorporated in November 1990
- Started transmitting in March 25, 1990
- Merged with Sky Television to form BSkyB
- Successor: Sky UK
- Location: London, England, Marco Polo House
- The name after merger is BSkyB
- Holding company is Sky plc.

So, the 10 questions can be structured as follows:

1. Qual foi o ano de fundação da British Satellite Broadcasting?
2. Em qual cidade a British Satellite Broadcasting tinha sua sede?
3. Quando a British Satellite Broadcasting começou a transmitir?
4. Em que ano a British Satellite Broadcasting foi incorporada?
5. Quais empresas se uniram para formar a British Sky Broadcasting?
6. Qual é a empresa sucessora da British Satellite Broadcasting?
7. Onde estava localizada a sede da British Satellite Broadcasting?
8. Qual é o nome da empresa formada pela fusão da British Satellite Broadcasting e da Sky Television?
9. Quem é a holding do BSkyB?
10. Em que ano a British Satellite Broadcasting foi estabelecida?

Wait, question 1 and 9 are similar, but 9 is about the year of establishment, which is the same as question 1. So that's a problem. Need to avoid that.

Alternatively, maybe question 9 is about the holding, which is Sky plc. So that's different.

So, let me adjust:

Question 1: Ano de fundação (1986)
Question 2: Cidade (London)
Question 3: Data de início da transmissão (25 de março de 1990)
Question 4: Ano de incorporação (1990)
Question 5: Empresa com a qual se uniu (Sky Television)
Question 6: Empresa sucessora (Sky UK)
Question 7: Localização da sede (Marco Polo House)
Question 8: Nome da empresa formada (BSkyB)
Question 9: Holding do BSkyB (Sky plc)
Question 10: Ano de estabelecimento (1986)

But question 1 and 10 are the same. So need to find another angle. Maybe question 10 can be about the location of the headquarters (Marco Polo House), but that's already in question 7. Alternatively, perhaps the answer to question 7 is "Marco Polo House" and question 10 is about the location of the headquarters.

But the user's example had a question about the location of the headquarters (Marco Polo House), so maybe that's covered in question 7. So I need to make sure all 10 questions are unique.

Alternatively, maybe one of the questions is about the incorporation date, but that's already in question 4. Wait, the incorporation date is November 1990, but the start of transmission is March 25, 1990. So maybe the answer to question 4 is 1990, and the answer to question 3 is March 25, 1990.

So, I think the 10 questions are okay as they are, even if some are similar. However, I need to check if the user's examples had similar questions. In the example, one of the questions was about the year of incorporation, which is 1990. So maybe that's acceptable.

So, the final list of 10 questions would be:

1. Qual foi o ano de fundação da British Satellite Broadcasting?
2. Em qual cidade a British Satellite Broadcasting tinha sua sede?
3. Quando a British Satellite Broadcasting começou a transmitir?
4. Em que ano a British Satellite Broadcasting foi incorporada?
5. Quais empresas se uniram para formar a British Sky Broadcasting?
6. Qual é a empresa sucessora da British Satellite Broadcasting?
7. Onde estava localizada a sede da British Satellite Broadcasting?
8. Qual é o nome da empresa formada pela fusão da British Satellite Broadcasting e da Sky Television?
9. Quem é a holding do BSkyB?
10. Em que ano a British Satellite Broadcasting foi estabelecida?

But question 1 and 10 are the same. So I need to adjust. Let's rephrase question 10 to be about the location of the headquarters. However, that's already in question 7. Alternatively, maybe the answer to question 10 is "Marco Polo House", but that's the same as question 7. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the answer to question 10 is the name of the company after the merger, which is BSkyB. But that's already in question 8. So I need to find another way.

Alternatively, maybe question 10 is about the merger year, but that's not in the facts. The facts mention that BSB was incorporated in November 1990 to form BSkyB, but the merger happened when? The context says that BSB was incorporated in November 1990 to form BSkyB. So the merger happened in 1990.

But the answer for question 5 is Sky Television. So maybe that's covered.

Alternatively, maybe the answer to question 10 is the name of the company after the merger, which is BSkyB, but that's already in question 8.

This is getting a bit tricky. Maybe I need to check the facts again to see if there's another aspect.

Looking back, the facts mention that the successor is Sky UK. So maybe question 6 is about that. Also, the answer for the holding is Sky plc, which is in question 9.

So, the 10 questions are:

1. Ano de fundação: 1986
2. Cidade: Londres
3. Data de início: 25 de março de 1990
4. Ano de incorporação: 1990
5. Empresa com a qual se uniu: Sky Television
6. Empresa sucessora: Sky UK
7. Localização da sede: Marco Polo House
8. Nome da empresa formada: BSkyB
9. Holding: Sky plc
10. Localização da sede (repetido em 7)

But that's a problem. So maybe the 10th question is about the location of the headquarters (Marco Polo House), but that's the same as question 7. So perhaps the user made a mistake in the example, but I need to follow the instructions.

Alternatively, maybe the 10th question is about the name of the company after the merger, but that's already in question 8. So I need to find another way.

Wait, the user's example had a question about the holding, but in the context, the BSB is a company, and BSkyB is part of Sky plc. So the holding is Sky plc. So that's correct.

Alternatively, maybe the 10th question is about the location of the headquarters, but that's already covered in question 7. So I need to adjust.

Maybe the 10th question is about the name of the company after the merger, but that's already in question 8. So perhaps the answer to question 10 is the same as question 1, but that's not allowed.

Alternatively, maybe the answer to question 10 is the name of the company after the merger, which is BSkyB. But that's question 8. So I need to find another aspect.

Wait, the facts mention that the BSB was incorporated in November 1990 to form BSkyB, so the incorporation date is November 1990, but the start of transmission is March 25, 1990. So maybe the answer to question 4 is 1990, and question 3 is March 25, 1990.

So the 10 questions would be:

1. Fundação (1986)
2. Cidade (Londres)
3. Data de início (25/03/1990)
4. Ano de incorporação (1990)
5. Empresa com a qual se uniu (Sky Television)
6. Empresa sucessora (Sky UK)
7. Localização da sede (Marco Polo House)
8. Nome da empresa formada (BSkyB)
9. Holding (Sky plc)
10. Nome da empresa após a fusão (BSkyB)

But that repeats question 8 and 10. So that's not allowed. Therefore, I need to adjust the questions to cover different aspects.

Perhaps the 10th question is about the location of the headquarters (Marco Polo House), which is already in question 7. So maybe I need to rephrase.

Alternatively, maybe the answer to question 10 is the name of the company before the merger, which is BSB. But that's not a question.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is about the fact that BSB was a company that provided satellite TV services, but that's not a question.

Wait, the context says that BSB was a company that provided direct satellite TV services. So maybe a question about the services they provided.

But the user's example didn't include that. Let me check the facts again. The facts mention that BSB was incorporated in November 1990 to form BSkyB, and the successor is Sky UK. Also, the BSB was a TV company, so maybe a question about their services.

But the example didn't have that, so maybe it's acceptable.

So, adding a question about the services:

10. Quais serviços a British Satellite Broadcasting oferecia?

But the answer would be "serviços de televisão por satélite direta". However, the user's example didn't include that, but according to the context, that's correct.

Alternatively, maybe that's better than repeating the same questions.

But the user's example had questions about the merger, successor, holding, etc., so maybe this is acceptable.

So, the final 10 questions would be:

1. Qual foi o ano de fundação da British Satellite Broadcasting?
2. Em qual cidade a British Satellite Broadcasting tinha sua sede?
3. Quando a British Satellite Broadcasting começou a transmitir?
4. Em que ano a British Satellite Broadcasting foi incorporada?
5. Quais empresas se uniram para formar a British Sky Broadcasting?
6. Qual é a empresa sucessora da British Satellite Broadcasting?
7. Onde estava localizada a sede da British Satellite Broadcasting?
8. Qual é o nome da empresa formada pela fusão da British Satellite Broadcasting e da Sky Television?
9. Quem é a holding do BSkyB?
10. Quais serviços a British Satellite Broadcasting oferecia?

But the answer for question 10 is "serviços de televisão por satélite direta", which is in the context.

But the user's example didn't have that, so maybe that's okay.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is "transmissão de televisão por assinatura" or something else. However, the context says "direct satellite TV services", so that's correct.

So this would be the 10th question.

But I need to make sure that all answers are correct.

So, I think that's the way to go.
