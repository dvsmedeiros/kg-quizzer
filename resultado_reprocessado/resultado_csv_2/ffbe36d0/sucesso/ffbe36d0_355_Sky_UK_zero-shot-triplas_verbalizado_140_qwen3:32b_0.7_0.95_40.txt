Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to generate 10 question-answer pairs based on the provided context and facts about British Satellite Broadcasting (BSB). First, I need to carefully read through all the given information to identify key points that can be turned into questions. 

Looking at the context, BSB was a UK-based satellite TV company that merged with Sky Television in 1990 to form BSkyB. They started transmitting in March 1990. The facts include details like its headquarters in London, the date it was founded (December 11, 1986), the merger date (November 1990), and various categories and models used on Wikipedia. 

I need to make sure each question is unique and covers different aspects. For example, one question could be about the merger, another about the launch date, another about the headquarters, etc. Also, there are specific TV channels they owned, like The Power Station and Galaxy, which can be points for questions. The films produced by BSB, such as Hardware and Memphis Belle, are also relevant. 

I should avoid repeating similar questions. For instance, if I ask about the merger partner once, I shouldn't ask another question about the same merger but in a different way. Each fact should be used to form a distinct question. Also, some facts mention categories or models used on Wikipedia, which might not be as relevant for the questions unless they're directly tied to the company's information. 

Let me list possible questions:
1. When was BSB founded?
2. When did BSB start transmitting?
3. Which company merged with BSB to form BSkyB?
4. Where is BSB headquartered?
5. What was the merger date of BSB and Sky Television?
6. Which TV channels did BSB own?
7. Which films were produced by BSB?
8. What type of company is BSB categorized as?
9. What was the successor company after the merger?
10. What is the correct name of the company including its legal form?

Each of these should have a clear answer from the facts provided. For example, the merger partner is Sky Television, the headquarters is London, the merger date is November 1990, etc. I need to verify each answer against the facts to ensure accuracy. Also, make sure the questions are in Portuguese and the answers are concise and directly from the given data.
