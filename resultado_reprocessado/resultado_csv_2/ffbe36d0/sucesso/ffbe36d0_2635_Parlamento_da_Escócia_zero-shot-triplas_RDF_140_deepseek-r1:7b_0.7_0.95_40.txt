Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs based on the provided data about the Scottish Parliament. First, I'll go through the data carefully to understand what information is available.

The data includes various properties of the Scottish Parliament such as its name, location, members, committees, voting system, and some related entities like the Scottish Government and different political parties. There are also details about its meetings, leaders, election dates, and connections to other projects or images.

I should start by identifying key pieces of information that could be turned into questions. For example, I know the location is Edinburgh, Scotland, so that can be a question with the answer as the location.

Next, there's information about the members of the presiding officer, which are Alison Johnstone and George Adam. That makes another potential question.

The composition section lists various committees, so I can create a question asking about these committees and provide the list as the answer.

There's mention of different parties like Scottish Labour, Liberal Democrats, National Party, Socialists, Unionist Coalition, etc., which could be good for questions about their seats or representation.

Election details are there too—election dates, leaders, next elections. These can form several questions around when it was in session and who the leaders were.

The voting system is listed as an additional member system, so that's another fact to put into a question.

There's also information about related projects like cultural, educational, transport sectors, which could be questions about the scope or influence of the parliament.

The structure and symbols section might provide interesting questions about its design or emblems.

Lastly, there are several visual identifiers like the building's image and various templates used in Wikipedia, which can be turned into questions about its appearance and associated content.

I should ensure that each question is clear and directly relates to the data provided. I'll avoid repeating information unless it's phrased differently but still relevant.
