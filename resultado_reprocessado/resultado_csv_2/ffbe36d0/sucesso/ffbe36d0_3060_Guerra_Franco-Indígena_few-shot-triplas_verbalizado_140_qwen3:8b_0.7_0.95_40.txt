Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs based on the provided context and facts about the French and Indian War. Let me start by understanding the content thoroughly.

The context mentions the war was between Britain and France in North America from 1754 to 1763, part of the Seven Years' War. Key points include alliances with Native American tribes: Algonquins, Hurons with France; Iroquois with Britain. The British had naval superiority which isolated French forces. Important events like the capture of Louisbourg in 1758, the fall of Quebec in 1759, and the capture of Montreal in 1760. The war also involved other conflicts like the Siege of Louisbourg and battles such as Fort Duquesne and Fort Ticonderoga. There are mentions of notable figures like Edward Braddock, James Wolfe, and George Washington. The war's outcome led to British control of French territories in Canada.

Now, looking at the facts provided, there are various details like specific battles (Battle of Fort Ligonier, Battle of Fort Duquesne), commanders (Edward Braddock, James Wolfe, Sir William Johnson), participants (George Washington, Benedict Arnold), and events (Expulsion of the Acadians, Long rifle usage). Also, there are mentions of the number of casualties, the use of Long rifles, and the categorization under different historical categories.

I need to form questions that cover these aspects. Let me list possible questions:

1. When did the French and Indian War take place?
2. Which sides were involved in the war?
3. Who were some key commanders?
4. What was the outcome of the war?
5. Which Native American tribes allied with France?
6. What was the significance of the Battle of Quebec?
7. What was the role of naval power in the war?
8. Who were some notable participants?
9. What was the impact of the war on the Thirteen Colonies?
10. What were some key battles or events?

Now, I need to ensure the answers are accurate based on the context and facts. For example, the war dates are 1754-1763. The sides were British colonies vs. French and their allies. Key commanders include Braddock, Wolfe, Johnson. The outcome was British control of Canada. Native tribes allied with France: Algonquins, Hurons, Wabanaki Confederacy. The Battle of Quebec (Ticonderoga?) was crucial. Naval superiority isolated French forces. Participants include Washington, Arnold. Impact on colonies: part of Seven Years' War, leading to British dominance. Key battles: Fort Duquesne, Louisbourg, Ticonderoga. Also, mention the use of Long rifles and the casualty numbers mentioned in the facts.

Wait, the context and facts mention the use of Long rifles. Also, the answer to the war's outcome is British control of French territories in Canada. The Expulsion of the Acadians is an event. The Long rifle was used in the war. The number of casualties: 1,500 died of wounds, and 10,000 force mentioned.

I need to make sure each question is distinct and covers different aspects. Let me structure the 10 pairs now, ensuring they are based on the given info and avoid repetition.
