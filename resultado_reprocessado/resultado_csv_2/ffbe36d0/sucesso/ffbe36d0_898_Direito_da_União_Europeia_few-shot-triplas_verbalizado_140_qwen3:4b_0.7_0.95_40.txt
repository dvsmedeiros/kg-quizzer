Okay, the user wants me to generate 10 pairs of questions and answers in Portuguese based on the provided context and facts. Let me start by carefully reading the context and facts given.

The context explains that the European Union's laws are a system of rules for its member states, aiming to promote peace, values, and well-being. It mentions institutions that transcend national states for cooperation and development. The EU's Court of Justice states it represents a new order of international law.

The facts list include mentions of the Law of the European Union, Common Market Law Review, John Bell, Henry G. Schermers, and various wiki templates used in the subject. The examples provided by the user include questions about the definition of EU law, primary sources, secondary sources, legislative bodies, effect on member states' laws, and the three sources of EU law.

I need to create 10 unique questions that cover different aspects of the provided content. The key points to cover are the definition of EU law, its sources (primary, secondary, maybe tertiary?), the institutions involved, the effect on member states, the role of legal scholars, and the use of specific templates or categories in the EU's legal framework.

Wait, the facts mention that the Law of the European Union uses certain wiki templates. So maybe questions about those templates? Also, the fact that Henry G. Schermers is a subdiscipline under EU law. Also, the Common Market Law Review is in the discipline of EU law. John Bell is a legal scholar in this area.

So possible questions could be about the main subject of EU law, the role of the Common Market Law Review, the subdisciplines, the legal scholars involved, the templates used, and the effect of EU law on member states.

Let me check the examples again. They have questions about the definition, primary sources, secondary sources, legislative bodies, effect on member states, the three sources (primary, secondary, complementar), and the main organs. Also, the examples have some repetition, but the user says to avoid similar questions.

So for the 10 questions, I need to ensure they are varied. Let me think of the following:

1. What is the main subject of the Law of the European Union?
2. What is the role of the Common Market Law Review in the context of EU law?
3. What is a subdiscipline of the Law of the European Union?
4. Who is a legal scholar associated with the Law of the European Union?
5. What are the two main organs of the legislative body of the EU?
6. What are the three main sources of EU law?
7. What is the effect of EU law on the laws of member states?
8. What are the primary sources of EU law?
9. What are the secondary sources of EU law?
10. What are the templates used in the Law of the European Union?

But wait, the example has "Tratados que instituem a União Europeia" as primary sources, and "regulamentos e diretrizes" as secondary. Also, the three sources are primary, secondary, and complementar. So maybe the third question can be about the subdisciplines, which is Henry G. Schermers. Also, the templates mentioned are Template:R from word rearrangement, Redirect category shell, and R from move.

But the user's examples include some repetition, but the rules say not to repeat similar questions. So I need to make sure each question is unique. Let me check the facts again:

- Law of the European Union is the main topic.
- Common Market Law Review is in this discipline.
- John Bell is a legal scholar in this area.
- Henry G. Schermers is a subdiscipline.
- The Law of the European Union uses certain wiki templates.

So, possible questions:

1. What is the main subject of the Law of the European Union?
2. What is the role of the Common Market Law Review in the context of EU law?
3. What is a subdiscipline of the Law of the European Union?
4. Who is a legal scholar associated with the Law of the European Union?
5. What are the two main organs of the legislative body of the EU?
6. What are the three main sources of EU law?
7. What is the effect of EU law on the laws of member states?
8. What are the primary sources of EU law?
9. What are the secondary sources of EU law?
10. What are the templates used in the Law of the European Union?

But the user's examples include some of these. However, the user provided examples with some repetition, but the instructions say not to repeat similar questions. So maybe adjust to avoid that. For example, the third question could be about the subdiscipline, and the fourth about the legal scholar. Then the others can be about the legislative bodies, sources, effect, etc.

Also, the user's example includes the effect of EU law on member states, which is "efeito direto ou indireto". So that's a good one. Also, the three sources are primary, secondary, and complementar.

So, the 10 questions would be:

1. Qual é o tema principal do Direito da União Europeia?
2. Qual é a função do Common Market Law Review no contexto do Direito da União Europeia?
3. Qual é uma subdisciplina do Direito da União Europeia?
4. Quem é um jurista associado ao Direito da União Europeia?
5. Quais são os dois órgãos principais do legislativo da União Europeia?
6. Quais são as três fontes principais do Direito da União Europeia?
7. Qual é o efeito do Direito da União Europeia sobre as leis dos estados membros?
8. Quais são as fontes primárias do Direito da União Europeia?
9. Quais são as fontes secundárias do Direito da União Europeia?
10. Quais são os modelos de página wiki utilizados no Direito da União Europeia?

Now, checking if each answer is correct based on the facts. The first question's answer is "Direito da União Europeia", which is the main topic. The second answer is "atua na disciplina Direito da União Europeia", as per the fact. Third question, Henry G. Schermers is a subdiscipline. Fourth, John Bell is a legal scholar. Fifth, the legislative bodies are the European Parliament and the Council. Sixth, the three sources are primary, secondary, and complementar. Seventh, the effect is direct or indirect. Eighth, the primary sources are the treaties. Ninth, secondary sources are regulations and guidelines. Tenth, the templates are Template:R from word rearrangement, Redirect category shell, and R from move.

Yes, that seems correct. Now, I need to structure this into JSON format without any markdown, as per the user's instruction.
