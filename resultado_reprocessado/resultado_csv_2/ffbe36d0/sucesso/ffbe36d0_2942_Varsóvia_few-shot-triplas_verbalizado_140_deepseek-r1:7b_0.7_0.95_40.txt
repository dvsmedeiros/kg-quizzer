Alright, I'm trying to create 10 objective questions about Warsaw based on the given context and facts. Each question should have a unique answer that's explicitly stated in the content.

First, I'll start by identifying key information from the context. Warsaw is the capital of Poland, located near the Vistula River. It has a population over two million and is known for its cultural significance as the birthplace of several notable figures like Sigismundo III, Leopold Tyrmand, and Kazimierz Porębski. Warsaw is also associated with football history, hosting the 1985–86 Inter Milan season.

Looking at the facts provided, I can extract specific details about people born or died in Warsaw, landmarks related to the city, and various organizations headquartered there. For example, Leopold Tyrmand was born in Warsaw, and Warsaw is home to institutions like the Polish Armed Forces and several universities.

I need to formulate questions that are clear and directly related to these facts. Each question should have only one correct answer as per the provided data. I'll ensure each question targets a different aspect of Warsaw's history, geography, culture, or notable figures associated with it.

Now, I'll go through each fact and create a corresponding question based on it:

1. Leopold Tyrmand was born in Warsaw.
2. Warsaw is located along the Vistula River.
3. Warsaw is situated approximately 260 km from the Baltic Sea.
4. Warsaw's population is around 1,716,855 people.

9. Warsaw was designated as a World Heritage City by UNESCO in 1980 for its historical center.
