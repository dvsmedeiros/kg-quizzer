Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs based on the given data about steam engines and examples provided. Let me start by reviewing the examples to understand the pattern.

The examples include questions about sources of heat without combustion, thermodynamic cycles, processes in those cycles, types of steam engines, historical inventors, and their contributions. 

First, I'll look at the data about steam engines. It mentions that it's a motor that converts thermal energy into mechanical work using water as the working fluid. It operates on the Rankine cycle, which involves steps like evaporation, expansion, condensation, and compression.

I should create questions related to these aspects. For instance:
1. What type of engine uses steam as the working fluid?
2. Name a major application of steam engines.
3. What is another term for a steam-powered engine.
4. Who improved the efficiency of steam engines with innovations like the separate condenser and parallel motion?
5. In which year did James Watt's significant improvements to the steam engine occur?

Next, considering thermodynamics:
6. Which cycle is essential in power plants using steam turbines?
7. What are the two main states of matter involved in a steam engine cycle.

Looking at historical figures and their contributions:
8. Who was known for early developments in steam engines, including the atmospheric engine.
9. What innovation did Thomas Newcomen introduce that was crucial for early steam engines?

Finally, applications and types:
10. What is another name for a steam-powered vehicle.

I need to make sure each question has a clear answer based on the data provided. Let me structure these into 10 pairs now.
