Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how the French and Indian War ended. From what I remember, it was a big conflict in North America between the British and the French, along with their Native American allies. But how did it all wrap up? 

I think it had something to do with other wars happening at the same time. Maybe the Seven Years' War? Because sometimes different regions have overlapping conflicts. So, if the Seven Years' War ended in 1763, then maybe that's when the French and Indian War also ended. That makes sense because they were connected.

I should check the dates. The French and Indian War started around 1754, right? So if it lasted until 1763, that would be nine years. But I'm not sure about the exact end date. Maybe there was a treaty involved. I remember something called the Treaty of Paris. That's probably when they settled everything. In 1763, the Treaty of Paris was signed, ending both the Seven Years' War and the French and Indian War.

So, putting it all together, the war ended in 1763 with the Treaty of Paris. This treaty would have formalized the end of hostilities between Britain and France, leading to British control over more territories in North America. That's why the French influence decreased after that.

The French and Indian War concluded in 1763 with the signing of the Treaty of Paris. This treaty marked the end of both the Seven Years' War and the French and Indian War, resulting in British control over previously contested regions in North America.

A Guerra Franco-Indígena terminou com o Tratado de Paris em 1763, que pôs fim também à Guerra dos Sete Anos.
