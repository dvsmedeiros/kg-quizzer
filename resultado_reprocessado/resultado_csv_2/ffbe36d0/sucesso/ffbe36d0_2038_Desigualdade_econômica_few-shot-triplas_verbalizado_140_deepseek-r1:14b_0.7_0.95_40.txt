Okay, so I need to generate 10 pairs of questions and answers based on the given context about economic inequality. The user provided a detailed context and some examples, but I have to make sure each question is unique and covers different aspects.

First, looking at the context, it talks about what economic inequality encompasses—distribution of income and wealth, types like global vs within countries, methods of measurement such as Gini coefficient and HDI. It also mentions various factors, authors, movements related to economic inequality.

From the facts section, there's a lot about models used in Wikipedia pages, images associated with the topic, categories it belongs to, and specific people involved like Branko Milanović and Robert Wade. There are also mentions of books and their subjects.

I should create varied questions that touch on different points: definitions, measurements, causes, effects, notable figures, policies, etc.

Let me brainstorm possible questions:

1. What is the primary focus of economic inequality?
   - Answer: Distribution of income and wealth.

2. Which index measures inequality by considering human development adjusted for inequality?
   - Answer: Índice de Desenvolvimento Humano Ajustado pela Desigualdade.

3. Name a well-known measure used to assess economic inequality.
   - Answer: Coeficiente de Gini.

4. What does the Occupy movement primarily address in various cities?
   - Answer: Economic inequality.

5. Which scholar is known for work on economic inequality, including "Capital in the Twenty-First Century"?
   - Answer: Thomas Piketty.

6. What global factor has reduced economic inequality between nations but increased it within countries?
   - Answer: Globalization.

7. What does a higher Gini coefficient indicate about income distribution?
   - Answer: Greater inequality.

8. Name an organization that focuses on reducing economic inequality through grants.
   - Answer: Nathan Cummings Foundation.

9. What is the main issue addressed in "The Hidden Wealth of Nations" by Gabriel Zucman?
   - Answer: Economic inequality and tax havens.

10. Which economist specializes in analyzing income distribution, particularly focusing on top earners?
    - Answer: Thomas Piketty.

Wait, I realize that some of these might overlap with the examples provided. For instance, question about Gini coefficient was in the examples. Maybe I should adjust to ensure uniqueness.

Let me revise:

1. What are the two main focuses of economic inequality?
   - Distribution of income and wealth.

2. Name a key index for measuring human development adjusted for inequality.
   - HDI Adjusted for Inequality.

3. Which model is most commonly used to measure economic inequality?
   - Coeficiente de Gini.

4. What movement in the US addresses economic inequality through protests?
   - Occupy Wall Street Movement.

5. Who is a notable economist known for works on wealth inequality, including "Capital and Ideology"?
   - Thomas Piketty.

6. How has globalization affected global economic inequality?
   - Reduced it globally but increased within countries.

7. What does the Gini coefficient indicate when its value approaches 1?
   - Perfect inequality (one person holds all).

8. Name an organization that targets economic inequality through funding initiatives.
   - The Ford Foundation.

Wait, in the facts provided, Nathan Cummings Foundation is mentioned as focusing on Economic inequality, so I should use that instead.

9. What book by Branko Milanović discusses global income inequality?
   - "World Bank Research Observer".

10. Which concept refers to the unequal distribution of wealth and income across society?
    - Wealth disparity.

Hmm, checking against the examples, some might still be similar. Maybe I should vary more on specific facts from the context.

Alternatively, using the 'Fatos' provided:

- Occupy Berlin has causes related to economic inequality.
- The image "Tenting in Los Angeles Skid Row.jpg" is associated with Economic inequality.
- Robert Wade and Mick Moore are scholars in this area.

So perhaps questions about these specifics would be better.

1. What movement in cities like Berlin addresses economic inequality?
   - Occupy Movement.

2. Which image illustrates homelessness related to economic inequality?
   - "Tenting in Los Angeles Skid Row.jpg".

3. Who are economists specializing in economic inequality mentioned?
   - Robert Wade and Mick Moore.

4. What is the primary focus of the Nathan Cummings Foundation?
   - Economic inequality through grants.

5. Name a book by Branko Milanović on income distribution.
   - "World Bank Research Observer".

6. Which concept refers to wealth disparity between different social classes?
   - Wealth disparity.

7. How does economic inequality affect global growth duration?
   - It makes it harder for sustained growth.

8. What is the main cause of Occupy Texas State protests?
   - Economic inequality.

9. What is a model used in Wikipedia pages for Economic inequality?
   - Template:Wealth, Template:Multiple image, etc.

10. Which index combines economic and social factors to measure development adjusted for inequality?
    - Human Development Index (HDI).

Wait, the HDI isn't specifically mentioned as adjusted for inequality in the context; it's the IHDI that is. So I should correct that.

Looking back at the context: "Índice de Desenvolvimento Humano Ajustado pela Desigualdade" which translates to Inequality-Adjusted Human Development Index (IHDI).

So, adjust question 10 accordingly.
