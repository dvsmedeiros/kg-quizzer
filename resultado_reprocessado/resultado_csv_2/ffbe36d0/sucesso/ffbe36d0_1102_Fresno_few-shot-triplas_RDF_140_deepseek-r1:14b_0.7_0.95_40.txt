Okay, so I need to come up with 10 question-answer pairs about Fresno based on the provided data and examples. Let me start by reviewing all the information given.

First, looking at the RDF data for Fresno, California, I see that it's classified under several categories like Area, Group, Site, and County Seats in California. It also has specific details such as area total, government type, settlement type, and a point with coordinates. There are mentions of various people born or having connections to Fresno, sports teams (like the Fresno St. Bulldogs), locations like the San Joaquin Valley, and even some companies.

From the examples provided, I notice that the questions cover different aspects: population size, geography, linguistics, history, transportation, and local culture. The answers are concise, often pulled directly from the data or inferred logically.

I should aim to create varied questions that touch on different domains related to Fresno. Let me brainstorm possible questions based on the data:

1. **Population**: Fresno is mentioned as a city with significant population, perhaps in the examples it's noted as the fifth largest.
2. **Geography**: The distance from Fresno to other cities like Los Angeles or geographical features.
3. **Etymology**: What does "Fresno" mean? It relates to the Spanish word for ash tree (freixo).
4. **Transportation**: Historical facts about railroads, streets, or public transport.
5. **Sports**: The local college's sports teams and their nicknames.
6. **Landmarks**: Notable buildings or events held in Fresno.
7. **Local businesses**: Companies based in Fresno, like Sun-Maid.
8. **Demographics**: Notable people born or associated with Fresno.

Now, I'll structure each question to target these areas, ensuring the answers are accurate and sourced from the provided data where possible.

For example, a question about Fresno's location relative to another major city would use the coordinates or known distances. A question on the meaning of "Fresno" would refer to the Spanish origin.

I also notice that in the examples, one question is about the year the Central Pacific Railroad established its station. So I can include questions about historical events or notable institutions based in Fresno.

Each answer should be clear and concise, using data where available. For instance, government type is a strong mayor, which could form a question about the city's governance structure.

I'll make sure to vary the topics to cover as many aspects of Fresno as possible, ensuring each question is distinct and informative.
