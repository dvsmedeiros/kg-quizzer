Okay, so I need to create 10 question-answer pairs based on the given context about prime numbers. Let me read through the context carefully and figure out what key points can be turned into questions.

First, the definition of a prime number is mentioned: it's a natural number greater than 1 with exactly two distinct divisors, 1 and itself. That sounds like a good question about what defines a prime number.

Next, twin primes are pairs that differ by two, like (3,5), (5,7), etc. I can ask how these pairs are named.

Euclid proved there are infinitely many primes around 300 BC. So a question about who demonstrated the infinitude of primes would fit here.

The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic says every natural number greater than 1 can be uniquely factored into primes. That's another theorem to ask about.

There are 168 primes less than 1000. A question asking for the count of primes below a thousand would work.

Gaussian primes are mentioned as an example, so I can ask what kind of primes exist beyond integers.

The context talks about forms like p# ±1, with examples such as 15877# – 1 being prime. So a question on these forms and their largest known examples would be good.

Landon Curt Noll is mentioned in relation to primes, so a question about notable contributors could include him.

The Sieve of Eratosthenes is an ancient method for finding primes, which can be the basis of another question.

Finally, Mersenne primes are a specific type related to 2^n -1. Since one of the facts mentions 2,147,483,647 as a prime, I can ask about these and their form.

Now, I need to make sure each question is clear and the answer directly addresses it without being too broad.
