Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs based on the provided context and facts about Victoria, Australia. Let me start by reading through the context and facts carefully to understand the key points.

First, the context mentions that Victoria is the smallest state in mainland Australia, the second most populous, and the most densely populated. Its capital is Melbourne, which is the second-largest city. It borders several other states and territories. The history includes being part of the Colony of New South Wales, gaining self-government in 1855, and the Gold Rush in the 1850s and 60s. Melbourne was the federal capital until Canberra was built in 1927. Politically, it has specific seats in the federal Parliament. The economy is diverse with sectors like services, education, etc. The PIB is second, but PIB per capita is sixth due to limited mining. Culturally, Melbourne is known for sports, museums, and events like the Australian Open. There are notable landmarks like the Melbourne Cricket Ground and the AFL finals. Also, there are universities like the University of Melbourne. 

Now, looking at the facts provided, there are a lot of specific details. For example, places like African Safari World, Wallagaraugh River, Peter Nugent's death, Transport Ticketing Authority's headquarters, etc. Also, some people were born or died in Victoria, and there are various institutions and landmarks mentioned.

I need to ensure the questions are varied and cover different aspects. Let me list possible topics: geography, population, history, economy, culture, notable places, political structure, education, notable people, and specific facts from the facts list.

Let me start drafting questions:

1. What is the capital of Victoria? (Answer: Melbourne)
2. What is Victoria's PIB rank in Australia? (Answer: second)
3. Which city is the second-largest in Australia? (Answer: Melbourne)
4. When did Victoria achieve self-government? (Answer: 1855)
5. What is the largest stadium in Australia? (Answer: Melbourne Cricket Ground)
6. Which university is the oldest in Victoria? (Answer: University of Melbourne)
7. What is Victoria's population density status? (Answer: most densely populated)
8. Which event is held annually at the Melbourne Cricket Ground? (Answer: AFL Grand Final)
9. What is the name of the federal capital that replaced Melbourne? (Answer: Canberra)
10. Which institution is located in Victoria? (Answer: Melbourne Convention and Exhibition Centre)

Wait, need to check if these answers are accurate based on the context and facts. Let me verify each point:

- Capital: Melbourne (correct)
- PIB rank: second (from context)
- Second-largest city: Melbourne (correct)
- Self-government: 1855 (context)
- Largest stadium: Melbourne Cricket Ground (context mentions it's the largest)
- Oldest university: University of Melbourne (context says it's a university, but need to confirm if it's the oldest)
- Population density: most densely populated (context)
- AFL Grand Final: yes, mentioned in context
- Federal capital: Canberra (correct)
- Institution: Melbourne Convention and Exhibition Centre (fact list mentions it's located in Victoria)

But wait, the facts list includes a lot of specific places and people. Maybe some questions can be based on those facts. However, the examples given in the problem include questions about economy, PIB rank, etc. Let me check the examples again to see the structure.

The examples include questions like "What type of economy does Victoria have?" with answer "diversified", "What is Victoria's rank in terms of GDP?" answer "second", etc. So following that, I can create similar questions.

But the user wants 10 pairs. Let me make sure each question is unique and covers different aspects. Also, need to ensure answers are accurate based on the context and facts provided.

Another possible question: Which landmark in Victoria hosts the Australian Open? Answer: Melbourne Park (but the fact list mentions Melbourne Convention and Exhibition Centre, but the context says the Australian Open is held there. Wait, the context says "Melbourne Convention and Exhibition Centre está localizado em Victoria (Australia)" in the facts. But in the context, it's mentioned that the Australian Open is held there. So the answer could be Melbourne Park. Wait, but the context says "Melbourne Convention and Exhibition Centre" is located in Victoria. However, the Australian Open is held at Melbourne Park, which is part of the city. Maybe the answer is Melbourne Park, but the fact list might have that. Alternatively, maybe the answer is the Melbourne Park, but I need to check the context.

Alternatively, since the user's examples include questions about the AFL Grand Final, which is held at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, that's a valid question.

Let me proceed to create the 10 questions, ensuring they are varied and based on the context and facts provided.
