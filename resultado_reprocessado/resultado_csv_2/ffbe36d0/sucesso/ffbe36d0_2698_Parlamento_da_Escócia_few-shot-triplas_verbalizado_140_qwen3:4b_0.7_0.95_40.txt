Okay, I need to generate 10 objective questions and answers based on the provided context and facts about the Scottish Parliament. Let me start by carefully reading through the context and the list of facts to make sure I understand all the key points.

The context mentions that the Scottish Parliament is the unicameral legislative body of Scotland, located in Holyrood, Edinburgh. It has 129 members (MSPs) elected every four years using a mixed proportional representation system. The last election was in May 2016. The first Scottish Parliament was the Parliament of Scotland, which existed from the 13th century until 1707 when it merged with the English Parliament to form the UK Parliament. The current Parliament was established in 1998, giving Scotland some legislative powers. The first session was in May 1999. The current president is mentioned but not named.

Looking at the facts, there are many details about constituencies, committees, elections, and other related information. The user provided a list of facts, so I need to make sure the questions are based on these. For example, the Scottish Parliament has a building called the Scottish Parliament Building. There are various constituencies like Dundee East, Inverness and Nairn, etc., all with the parliamentary name "Scottish Parliament". There are also committees such as Economy, Energy and Tourism, Education in Scotland, etc. The next election is scheduled for May 7, 2021, but the last one was May 5, 2016. The leader is Alison Johnstone, and the presiding officer is part of the Scottish Parliament. The type is specified as Group100031264, and it's located in Scotland.

I need to create 10 distinct questions. Let me check the examples given by the user. The examples include questions about the establishment of the current parliament, the law that gave it powers, the areas where the parliament can legislate, the reserved powers, the historical lack of a parliament, the duration of governance by the UK Parliament, the reason for previous proposals being archived, the time of increased nationalism, and the recommendation from the Kllbrandon report.

So, I need to avoid repeating similar questions. The user's examples include topics like the date of the current parliament's establishment, the law, the areas of legislation, reserved powers, historical context, election dates, etc. I should focus on different aspects from the provided facts.

Looking at the facts, here are some points I can use:

1. Location of the Scottish Parliament (Holyrood, Edinburgh).
2. Number of members (129).
3. Election system (mixed proportional representation).
4. Next election date (May 7, 2021? Wait, the context says "próxima eleição 2021-05-06" but the fact says "participou da última eleição 2021-05-06". Wait, but the context mentions "a última eleição 2021-05-06" but the next election is mentioned as "próxima eleição 2021-05-06"? That seems conflicting. Wait, the user's context says "participou da última eleição 2021-05-06" and "próxima eleição 2021-05-06". Wait, that can't be right. Maybe there's a mistake in the data. Let me check again.

Wait, in the facts list, there's a line: "Scottish Parliament participou da última eleição 2021-05-06" and "Cabinet Secretary for Covid Recovery é membro de Scottish Parliament". Also, the context says "a última eleição 2021-05-06". But the user's example had a question about the next election date. However, the facts might have conflicting dates. Wait, the user's context says "a última eleição 2021-05-06" and "próxima eleição 2021-.05.06" (maybe a typo). Wait, perhaps the correct next election date is 2021, but the user's facts might have an error. Alternatively, maybe the next election is in 2026. But the given facts have "próxima eleição 2021-05-06", which is conflicting. Maybe the user made a mistake, but I should take the facts as given.

Alternatively, maybe the next election is in 2021, but the last one was in 2016. But the user's context says "a última eleição 2021-05-06", which might be a mistake. However, the user's example had a question about the next election date, but in the current data, it's not clear. Maybe I should focus on the facts as given, even if they are conflicting. Let me proceed.

Other points: the Scottish Parliament is located in Scotland, the current leader is Alison Johnstone, there are committees like Finance, Education, etc., the presiding officer is part of the Scottish Parliament, the type is WikicatUnicameralLegislatures, the building is in Edinburgh, the system of voting is Additional member system, the next election is in May 2021 (as per the fact), but the last was in May 2016. However, the user's context says "a última eleição 2021-05-06" which might be a mistake. Alternatively, maybe the last election was in 2016, and the next is in 2021. The user's example has a question about the next election, so maybe the answer is May 2021.

So, possible questions:

1. Where is the Scottish Parliament located?
2. How many members does the Scottish Parliament have?
3. What is the system of voting used in the Scottish Parliament?
4. What is the name of the current leader of the Scottish Parliament?
5. Which committee is responsible for financial matters?
6. What is the name of the building where the Scottish Parliament is located?
7. What is the name of the presiding officer of the Scottish Parliament?
8. What is the type of the Scottish Parliament according to the given data?
9. When was the last election of the Scottish Parliament?
10. What is the name of the law that established the current Scottish Parliament?

But I need to check the facts to ensure these are correct. For example, the current leader is Alison Johnstone, as per the fact. The presiding officer is part of the Scottish Parliament, but the name isn't given. The building is the Scottish Parliament Building. The type is WikicatUnicameralLegislatures. The last election is May 2016 (as per the user's context, but the fact says 2021-05-06, which might be an error). Alternatively, if the fact is correct, the last election was in May 2021.

Wait, the user's context says "a última eleição 2021-05-06" and "participou da última eleição 2021-05-06". So the last election was in May 2021, but the example given by the user's example had the last election in 2016. This is conflicting. But according to the user's data, the last election was in 2021. However, in reality, the last election was in 2016, so perhaps there's an error in the user's data. But since I have to follow the user's data, I'll proceed with the given facts.

So, the last election was in May 2021. Therefore, the next one would be in 2026? But the user's data says "próxima eleição 2021-05-06", which is conflicting. Maybe the user made a mistake, but I'll take the facts as they are.

Therefore, the answer for the question about the last election would be May 2021. The system of voting is the additional member system. The committees include Finance, Education, etc.

Now, I need to make sure the questions are distinct and based on the facts. Let's try to create 10 unique questions.
