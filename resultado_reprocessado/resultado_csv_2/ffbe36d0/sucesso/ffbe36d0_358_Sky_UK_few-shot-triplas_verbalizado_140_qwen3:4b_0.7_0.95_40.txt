Okay, I need to generate 10 objective questions and answers based on the provided context and facts about British Satellite Broadcasting (BSB). Let me start by going through the context and facts carefully.

The context says BSB was a UK-based TV company that provided direct satellite TV services. It was incorporated in November 1990 to form BSkyB and started transmitting in March 1990. The facts list various details: location in London, founded in 1986, merged with Sky Television to form BSkyB, owned channels like The Movie Channel, The Power Station, Now, Galaxy, and The Computer Channel. Also, it has images, categories, and types related to media companies, organizations, etc.

I need to make sure the questions cover different aspects. Let me list possible topics: founding year, location, merger, owned channels, categories, types, image representatives, etc. Avoid repeating similar questions.

First question: Founded year. The facts say it was founded on 1986-12-11, so answer is 1986.

Second: Location. It's in London and the UK, so answer could be London or United Kingdom.

Third: When did it start transmitting? The context says March 25, 1990.

Fourth: Merged with Sky Television to form BSkyB. The fact says "teve como destino Merged with Sky Television plcto form BSkyB", so answer is Sky Television.

Fifth: Owned channels. The Movie Channel is one, so answer that.

Sixth: Categories. One is Category:1990 mergers and acquisitions.

Seventh: Types. It's an organization, so answer Organization.

Eighth: Image representatives. BSBDishes.jpg or Squarial2.jpg.

Ninth: The company's name in full is British Satellite Broadcasting plc.

Tenth: It was disestablished in 1990, so answer 1990.

Wait, but the user said to generate 10. Let me check if I have enough. Maybe add more about the merger, owned channels, and categories. Also, check if there are other unique facts like the types (Company, Organization, etc.), or the fact that it's a defunct company. Also, the image representatives, the channels, the categories.

Let me make sure each question is unique and based on the facts. Let me structure the questions and answers accordingly, ensuring they are all correct and based on the provided data.
