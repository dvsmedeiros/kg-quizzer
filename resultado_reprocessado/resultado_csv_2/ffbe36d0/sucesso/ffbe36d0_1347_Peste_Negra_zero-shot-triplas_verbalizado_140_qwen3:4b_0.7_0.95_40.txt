Okay, I need to generate 10 objective questions and answers based on the provided context and facts. Let me start by carefully reading through the given information to understand the key points.

First, the context talks about the Black Death, its impact, causes, spread, and effects. The facts include things like the number of deaths, the bacteria involved, the routes of spread, historical events, and various templates used in Wikipedia pages. There are also specific dates, images, and other details.

I need to make sure each question is unique and covers different aspects. Let me list out possible topics: origin, cause, spread routes, death toll, historical impact, related diseases, images, dates, and maybe some specific facts like the person involved in studying it.

Wait, the user mentioned that the answer must be directly from the context or inferable from it. So I can't add external knowledge. Let me check the facts again to ensure accuracy.

For example, the origin is in Central or Eastern Asia, spread via the Silk Road. The cause is Yersinia pestis, leading to bubonic, pneumonic, and septicemic plague. The death toll is 75-200 million, with 30-60% in Europe. The pandemic started in 1346, peaked in 1347-1351, and had effects on Europe's population recovery.

Also, there are images related to the plague, like the Oriental rat flea, and specific dates mentioned, such as April 2020 (maybe a typo? Or a specific event? Wait, in the facts, there's a date "data April 2020" but that seems out of context. Maybe it's a mistake, but I should stick to the given facts.)

Wait, the facts have "Black Death possui data April 2020" which might be an error. But since the context says the Black Death was in the 14th century, maybe that's a typo. However, the user provided that, so I should use it as given. But that seems conflicting. Maybe it's a mistake in the data, but the user says to generate based on the provided facts. So I should include that if it's there.

Another fact is that the plague was spread by fleas on rats via Genoese ships. Also, the plague caused social, economic, and religious upheavals. The population of Europe took 200 years to recover. Some cities like Florence only recovered in the 19th century.

Now, I need to create 10 questions. Let me think of each aspect:

1. Origin of the Black Death
2. Cause (bacteria and types of plague)
3. Spread route (Silk Road, rats, fleas)
4. Death toll (75-200 million)
5. Impact on Europe (population recovery)
6. Related disease (bubonic plague)
7. Historical event (quote from the text)
8. Image associated with the plague (flea, etc.)
9. Date of the pandemic (1346)
10. Person involved in studying it (Ole Jørgen Benedictow)

Wait, the facts mention that "Ole Jørgen Benedictow atua nas áreas Black Death" and "Ole Jørgen Benedictow atua na disciplina Black Death". So that's a person involved in the study.

Also, there's a mention of the "data April 2020" which is confusing, but maybe it's a mistake. However, the user provided that, so I need to use it. But that might not be correct. However, the context says the Black Death was in the 14th century, so April 2020 is likely a typo. But I should follow the given facts.

But maybe that's a mistake, but the user says to use the provided facts. So perhaps the question is about the date mentioned in the facts.

So, let me structure the questions accordingly, ensuring each is unique and covers different aspects. Let me check if I can get 10 distinct points from the given facts.

I think that's possible. Now, I need to make sure each question is in Portuguese, and the answer is directly from the facts or context.
