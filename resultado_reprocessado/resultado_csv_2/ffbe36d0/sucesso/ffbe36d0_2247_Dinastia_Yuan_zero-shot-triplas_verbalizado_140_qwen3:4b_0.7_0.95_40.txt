Okay, I need to generate 10 pairs of questions and answers based on the provided context and facts about the Yuan Dynasty. Let me start by carefully reading through the given information to make sure I understand all the key points.

The context mentions that the Yuan Dynasty was founded by Kublai Khan, a grandson of Genghis Khan, in 1271. The facts list a lot of details, including dates, events, people, places, and various models used in the wiki page for the Yuan Dynasty. There are mentions of the capital, Shangdu, and Khanbaliq, as well as other historical events like the Battle of Yamen and the Battle of Lake Poyang. Also, there are references to the use of different templates in the wiki, such as Template:Commons category-inline, Template:Main, etc.

I need to ensure that each question is unique and covers different aspects. Let's start by identifying key elements: the founding year, the capital, the founder, the relation to other dynasties or events, the use of specific models in the wiki, the religious practices, the currency, and the end date. Also, the mention of specific people and places, like the Battle of Ngasaunggyan, the Haihui Temple, and the Red Turban Rebellions.

I should avoid repeating similar questions. For example, one question could be about the founder, another about the capital, another about the use of a specific template, another about the end date, another about the religious practices, another about the currency, another about the Battle of Yamen, another about the Red Turban Rebellions, another about the use of a specific image, and another about the relation to the Song Dynasty. 

Wait, the user mentioned that the answer must be directly or inferably from the content. So I need to make sure that each answer is based on the given facts. For example, the Yuan Dynasty's start year is 1271, the capital is Shangdu, the founder is Kublai Khan, and the end date is 1368. Also, the use of the Template:Infobox former country, the currency is Cash (Chinese coin), and the religious practices include Buddhism, Mongolian Tengrism, etc.

I need to check for each fact to ensure that the questions are based on them. Let me list out possible questions:

1. When was the Yuan Dynasty founded?
2. What is the capital of the Yuan Dynasty?
3. Who founded the Yuan Dynasty?
4. What is the end date of the Yuan Dynasty?
5. Which template is used for the Yuan Dynasty's wiki page?
6. What currency was used during the Yuan Dynasty?
7. Which historical event involved the Yuan Dynasty as a combatant?
8. What is the religious composition of the Yuan Dynasty?
9. Which temple was established during the Yuan Dynasty?
10. What is the name of the "Great Yuan" in the context of the Yuan Dynasty?

Now I need to make sure these questions are all different and cover various aspects. Let me check each one against the facts:

- Founded in 1271: yes.
- Capital Shangdu: yes.
- Founder Kublai Khan: yes.
- End date 1368: yes.
- Template:Infobox former country: yes.
- Currency Cash (Chinese coin): yes.
- Battle of Yamen: yes.
- Religious practices: yes.
- Haihui Temple: yes.
- "Great Yuan" as a title: yes.

That's 10. Now I need to phrase them as questions in Portuguese, ensuring the answers are correct and based on the facts. Also, check for any possible overlaps or if any facts are not covered. The answer for the template should be "Template:Infobox former country" as per the facts. The currency is Cash (Chinese coin). The Battle of Yamen is mentioned as a combatant. The Haihui Temple is in Xiangtan, established during the Yuan. The religious practices are listed as Buddhism, Mongolian Tengrism, etc. The "Great Yuan" is the title.

I think that's all. Let me structure them into the JSON format as specified, making sure each question is unique and covers different aspects.
