Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants 10 question-answer pairs based on the provided context and facts. First, I need to understand the context thoroughly. The main topic is the immune system, its components, functions, and related terms. The facts list various elements like cells (e.g., Basophil, T cell, B cell), diseases (like Sepsis, Food allergy), and other terms like Adaptive NK cell, Monocyte, etc.

I need to make sure each question is unique and covers different aspects. Let me start by identifying key components and processes. For example, the origin of the term "immune system" is mentioned with Mechnikov. That's a good starting point. Then, the function of the immune system in detecting pathogens and distinguishing self from non-self.

Next, the fact that the immune system has both innate and adaptive parts. The adaptive part includes memory cells and vaccination. Also, diseases like autoimmunity (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis) and immunodeficiency (like HIV) are mentioned. There's also mention of cells like macrophages, dendritic cells, and others.

I should also consider the structure of the immune system, like the bone marrow's role in producing white blood cells. The facts include terms like "immunology" as the scientific study. Also, the mention of certain diseases like diabetes type 1 and rheumatoid arthritis as examples of autoimmunity.

Now, I need to create 10 questions. Let me list possible questions:

1. Who coined the term "immune system"? (Answer: Ilya Ilyich Mechnikov)
2. What is the function of the immune system? (Answer: Protect the body against diseases by detecting pathogens and distinguishing self from non-self)
3. What is the basis of vaccination? (Answer: Adaptive immunity and memory cells)
4. What is an example of an autoimmune disease? (Answer: Rheumatoid arthritis)
5. What is the role of the bone marrow in the immune system? (Answer: Produces white blood cells)
6. Which cell is part of the immune system and is involved in allergic reactions? (Answer: Mast cell)
7. What is the primary cause of immunodeficiency? (Answer: Reduced immune system activity, such as HIV)
8. What is the role of T cells in the immune system? (Answer: Help coordinate the immune response and directly attack infected cells)
9. What is the function of phagocytosis in the immune system? (Answer: Engulf and destroy pathogens)
10. Which disease is associated with the immune system's overreaction? (Answer: Food allergy)

Wait, I need to check if these are all covered in the facts and context. Also, ensure that each answer is directly inferable. For example, the answer to question 7 might need to be more specific. The facts mention immunodeficiency can be due to genetic, acquired (like HIV), or immunosuppressants. So the answer should mention that the primary cause is reduced immune activity, possibly due to HIV.

Another point: the context mentions that the immune system has both innate and adaptive mechanisms. So maybe a question about the difference between innate and adaptive. But the user wants 10 pairs, so I need to make sure each question is distinct.

Also, check if all answers are present in the facts. For example, the fact lists "Sepsis tem como causa médica Immune system" so sepsis is related, but the answer might be that it's an immune response to infection. However, the user's instruction says the answer must be directly from the content. Let me verify each fact and context.

Another possible question: What is the role of B cells in the immune system? (Answer: Produce antibodies.)

But I need to ensure that each question is unique and not repeating the same aspect. Let me compile the 10 pairs now, making sure they are varied and answers are correct based on the provided context and facts.
