Okay, I need to generate 10 pairs of questions and correct answers based on the provided context about Huguenots. Let me start by understanding the key points from the context.

First, I know that Huguenots were French Protestants during the 16th-century religious wars. They faced persecution, especially after Louis XIV revoked the Edict of Nantes in 1685. Around 300,000 Huguenots left France. They were mainly Calvinists and part of the Reformed Church, while some groups in Alsace-Moselle and Montbéliard were Lutherans.

Now, I should think about various aspects to form questions. Possible topics include their origins, beliefs, persecution, migration, reasons for leaving, famous individuals, related groups, legacy, and symbols.

I need to make sure each question is unique and covers different angles. Let me brainstorm some questions:

1. What led many Huguenots to leave France?
2. Which Calvinist group were Huguenots primarily associated with?
3. Why did the Edict of Nantes matter to Huguenots?
4. How many Huguenots left France after 1685?
5. Who were known as "Huguenots" in New York and Staten Island?
6. What religion did Huguenots practice before their exile?
7. Which group was related to the Huguenots but of a different faith?
8. How were Huguenots treated under Louis XIV's rule?
9. Which term refers to the forced departure of Huguenots from their places of worship?
10. What is associated with Huguenot identity besides their faith?

Now, I'll form each into a question and find the correct answers.

1. **What led many Huguenots to leave France?** - The revocation of the Edict of Nantes by Louis XIV.
2. **Which Calvinist group were Huguenots primarily associated with?** - The Reformed Church (Igreja Reformada).
3. **Why did the Edict of Nantes matter to Huguenots?** - It granted them religious freedom, which was revoked.
4. **How many Huguenots left France after 1685?** - Approximately 300,000.
5. **Who were known as "Huguenots" in New York and Staten Island?** - The Scotch-Irish Americans.
6. **What religion did Huguenots practice before their exile?** - Calvinism, within the broader Protestant faith.
7. **Which group was related to the Huguenots but of a different faith?** - The Scotch-Irish Americans.
8. **How were Huguenots treated under Louis XIV's rule?** - They faced severe persecution and restrictions.
9. **What is associated with Huguenot identity besides their faith?** - Their cultural practices, memorials, and cemeteries.
10. **What is the term for the forced departure of Huguenots from their places of worship?** - The Dragonnade.

I think these cover various aspects without repetition. Each question relates directly to the context provided, and the answers are clear and specific.
