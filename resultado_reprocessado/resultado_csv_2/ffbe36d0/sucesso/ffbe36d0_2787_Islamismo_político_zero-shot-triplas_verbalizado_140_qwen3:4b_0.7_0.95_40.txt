Okay, I need to generate 10 pairs of questions and answers based on the provided context and facts about Islamism. Let me start by understanding the context given. The user mentioned that Islamism is a political-religious ideology, and the facts list various organizations, parties, and individuals associated with it. 

First, I should make sure that each question is distinct and covers different aspects. The context talks about the implementation of Sharia, pan-Islamic unity, creation of Islamic states, and rejection of non-Muslim influences. The facts list numerous entities with Islamism as their ideology. 

I need to create questions that ask for specific information from the facts. For example, asking which organizations have Islamism as their ideology. Also, some facts mention individuals or movements, so questions can be about those. 

I should avoid repetition. Each question should be unique. Let me check the list of facts again. There are many entries, so I can pick different ones. For example, one question about the type of Islamism, another about the image representative, another about the movement associated with Jamal al-Din al-Afghani, and so on. 

I need to ensure that the answers are directly from the facts provided. For instance, the image representative of Islamism is mentioned as "Dr Ali Shariati.jpg", so a question can be about that. Also, some facts mention the type of Islamism, like "Dispute107181935", so a question about that type. 

Another point is that some facts mention the use of specific templates in Wikipedia, like "Template:Wiktionary-inline", so a question about that could be asked. Also, the fact that "Houthi movement" has Islamism as ideology can be a question. 

I should also check for different aspects: ideology, image, type, associated movements, individuals, etc. I need to make sure each question is about a different aspect. Let me list out possible questions and answers based on the facts. 

For example:
1. What is the type of Islamism mentioned in the facts?
2. Which organization is associated with the image "Dr Ali Shariati.jpg"?
3. Which movement is associated with Jamal al-Din al-Afghani?
4. What is the main focus of Islamism according to the context?
5. Which group is mentioned as having the ideology of Islamism in the facts?
6. What is the image representative of Islamism according to the facts?
7. Which political party is associated with Islamism in the facts?
8. What is the model used for the page of Islamism in Wikipedia?
9. Which group is mentioned as having the ideology of Islamism in the facts?
10. What is the main goal of Islamism as per the context?

I need to make sure each of these questions is based on the facts provided and that the answers are accurate. Also, check that the questions are in Portuguese and that the answers are in Portuguese as well. Let me verify each fact to ensure the answers are correct. 

For example, the first fact says "Islamism é do tipo Dispute107181935", so the answer should be that. The image representative is "Dr Ali Shariati.jpg". Jamal al-Din al-Afghani is part of the movement Islamism. The main focus is implementing Sharia, pan-Islamic unity, creating Islamic states, and rejecting non-Muslim influences. 

I need to ensure that all answers are directly from the facts and not inferred beyond the given information. Also, check that the questions are not repetitive. Once all 10 are formed, they should be in JSON format as specified.
