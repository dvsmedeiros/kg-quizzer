Okay, so I need to create 10 question-answer pairs based on the context provided about Southern California. Let me first understand what Southern California is known for. 

I know it's a region in the southern part of California and is famous for places like Los Angeles and San Diego. The climate there is Mediterranean, which means warm, dry summers and mild winters. They have deserts like the Mojave Desert, mountain ranges such as the Sierra Nevada and the Peninsular Ranges. 

Economically, Southern California has a strong presence in entertainment industries, especially Hollywood. It's also a big area for aerospace companies like Boeing and Lockheed Martin. The agriculture is prominent too, with crops like citrus fruits, nuts, and vegetables.

Transportation-wise, they have an extensive freeway system, including the well-known Interstate 5 and Highway 101. Public transport includes Metrolink and Metro Rail systems. 

Tourist attractions include beaches like Santa Monica and Venice Beach, Disneyland in Anaheim, and national parks such as Joshua Tree and Yosemite. The Golden Gate Bridge is also a significant landmark, though it's actually in San Francisco, which is more northern, so maybe I should double-check that.

Educationally, there are top universities like UC Los Angeles (UCLA) and the California Institute of Technology (Caltech). Environmental issues include water scarcity and wildfires, especially with recent increases in frequency due to climate change.

Now, considering all these points, I need to form varied questions covering different aspects. Let me brainstorm:

1. What's Southern California known for? Focus on entertainment.
2. Main mountain ranges?
3. Major cities besides Los Angeles?
4. Prominent aerospace companies.
5. Primary freeway system.
6. Leading public universities.
7. Key agricultural products.
8. Notable national parks.
9. Environmental challenges faced.
10. Renowned research institutions.

Wait, some of these might be too similar or need to ensure each is unique and covers different areas without repetition. Let me adjust for better variety:

1. Entertainment centers - Hollywood.
2. Mountain ranges surrounding LA basin.
3. Largest cities in the region.
4. Aerospace companies' location.
5. Freeway system spanning multiple counties.
6. Leading public universities.
7. Major agricultural products.
8. National parks within Southern California.
9. Environmental issues beyond wildfires.
10. Research institutions besides Caltech.

I think that covers a good range of topics without overlapping too much. Now, I'll phrase each as a clear question with the correct answer based on the context.
