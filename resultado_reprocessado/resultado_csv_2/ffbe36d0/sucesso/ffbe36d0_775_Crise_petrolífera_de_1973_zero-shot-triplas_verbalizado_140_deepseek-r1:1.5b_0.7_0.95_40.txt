Okay, let me try to figure out how to generate these 10 pairs of questions and answers based on the provided context and facts. First, I'll read through the context carefully to understand what's happening during the 1973 oil crisis.

The context mentions that the crisis started in September 1973 with OPAEP setting an embargo on Canada, Japan, etc., and it continued until March 1974 when prices jumped. It also talks about how much they rose from $3 to ~$12 per barrel. The term "choque" (choke) is used for both the oil price change and the economic impact.

Now, looking at the facts list provided, I see several things that are relevant:

1. The oil crisis starts in 1973 when OPAEP proclamates an embargo.
2. The prices of oil went up significantly, from $3 to about $12 per barrel.
3. It's classified as a "choice," which might mean multiple choices but is related to the economic impact.

I need to create two questions for each pair. Since it's an event with both a cause and a consequence, I can structure each question around these aspects.

For the first question, I'll focus on the cause: "When did the 1973 oil crisis start?" The answer should mention that OPAEP proclamated an embargo in September 1973. I need to use Portuguese for the response, so I'll make sure it's clear and direct.

Next, for the second question about the consequence, focusing on the price jump: "What was the oil price like from January to March 1974?" The answer should state that prices jumped from $3 to ~$12 per barrel. Again, using Portuguese is essential here.

I'll do this similarly for each subsequent pair, alternating between cause and consequence, ensuring each question has a unique context and response as per the rules provided.
