Okay, so I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs about Harvard University based on the provided data and examples. Let me start by understanding what's given.

First, there's a list of RDF triples where many people are linked to Harvard University with properties like almaMater or workInstitution. Then, there's an example section with some questions and answers that seem to be about specific facts related to Harvard.

Looking at the examples, the questions cover various aspects: individuals associated with Harvard, events (like when something happened), names during certain times, organizations founded, people who transformed the university, major landmarks or systems (libraries), numbers of items in those systems, notable alumni counts, etc.

I should create similar questions. Let me think about what information I can extract from the RDF. Since the data includes many individuals with connections to Harvard, maybe some are famous or notable figures. For example, John Harvard is mentioned as having a statue at the university. Other names like Henry Louis Gates, Seamus Heaney might be professors or notable alumni.

Looking at the data, there's also information about the library system (Harvard Library) and its size. The examples mention 79 individual libraries and 18 million volumes, so I can use that. Also, the fact that eight U.S. presidents are alumni is in the example, so maybe others include notable figures like Supreme Court justices or Nobel laureates.

I should structure each question to target a specific piece of information. For instance:

- Who was the first female president? (From the data, I don't see this, but perhaps it's known elsewhere.)
- When did Harvard start admitting women? (Not in the RDF, but maybe from general knowledge or another source.)
- What is the name of Harvard's oldest building? (Maybe "Old Massachusetts Hall." But not sure if it's in the data.)

Wait, the provided RDF doesn't have explicit information about these facts. The examples probably come from external knowledge because the RDF only lists individuals connected to Harvard and some metadata about Harvard itself.

So I might need to rely on common facts about Harvard for these questions, as the RDF alone doesn't provide all the necessary details.

Let me list possible topics:

1. Notable alumni
2. Historical events (e.g., coeducation)
3. Significant buildings or landmarks
4. Library system statistics
5. Presidents of Harvard
6. Nobel laureates associated with Harvard
7. Specific programs or schools within Harvard
8. Athletic teams or sports history
9. Notable research centers or institutes
10. Symbology, like the seal or symbols

I'll try to create questions around these areas. For example:

- What is the name of Harvard's athletic teams? (They are called the Crimson.)
- When was the Harvard Business School founded?
- Who established the John F. Kennedy School of Government?

But I need to make sure the answers are accurate and based on reliable information, even if not present in the RDF.

Alternatively, since the examples include questions about numbers (like 1977 for coeducation), I can create similar numerical questions.

I should also consider varying the types of questions: some about people, others about dates, places, or numbers.

Let me start drafting:

1. Quem foi o presidente de Harvard que implementou a coeducação?
   Resposta: Derek Bok

Wait, no, in the example, the answer is 1977 for coeducation, but the person might be different. Let me check—actually, the coeducation was implemented in 1977 under President Derek Bok.

2. Qual é o nome do jardim botânico associado a Harvard?
   Resposta: Jardins Botânicos de Arnold

3. Quem foi o primeiro presidente da universidade?
   Resposta: Henry Dunster

4. Em que ano Harvard tornou-se uma universidade pública?
   Resposta: Nunca, pois é privada.

Hmm, maybe that's not the best question since it's a private university. Let me think of another.

5. Quantas medalhas Fields ganharam alunos ou professores de Harvard?
   Resposta: 8 medalhas Fields

6. Qual é o nome do estádio principal de futebol americano da universidade?
   Resposta: Harvard Stadium

7. Quem fundou a Escola de Medicina de Harvard?
   Resposta: Thomas Story Kirkland e John Warren

8. Em que ano foi criado o Prêmio Nobel associado à Universidade?
   Resposta: 1901 (mas Harvard teve laureados desde então)

Wait, not sure about the exact year; maybe better to say how many Nobel winners are alumni.

Alternatively, stick with numbers from examples.

Let me adjust:

7. Quantos presidentes dos EUA são ex-alunos de Harvard?
   Resposta: Oito

(As in the example.)

8. Qual é o nome do túmulo mais famoso no campus?
   Resposta: Túmulo de John Harvard

9. Quando foi fundada a Universidade?
   Resposta: 1636

10. Qual é o nome da revista acadêmica mais renomada de Harvard?
    Resposta: The Harvard Law Review

I think this covers a variety of topics and uses the RDF data where possible, but some answers would come from general knowledge since the RDF doesn't include all these facts explicitly.
