Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs based on the provided context and facts about Southern California. Let me start by reading through the context and the facts carefully. 

First, the context mentions that Southern California is the third part of California, with no clear boundaries, bordered by the Pacific Ocean on the west, Mexico on the south, and Arizona on the east. The population in 2019 was about 23.8 million.

Now, looking at the facts, there's a lot of information. Some key points include specific companies, people, events, and locations associated with Southern California. For example, Fosselman's Ice Cream Company serves the region, there's a 1987 earthquake, and several notable people were born there.

I need to ensure each question is unique and covers different aspects. Let me brainstorm possible questions. 

1. What is the population of Southern California as of 2019? The answer would be 23.8 million. That's a direct fact from the context.

2. Which earthquake affected Southern California in 1987? The answer is the Whittier Narrows earthquake. That's from the facts.

3. Which company serves the Southern California region? Fosselman's Ice Cream Company is mentioned. 

4. What is the name of the image representing Southern California? The context lists several images, like Sdmarina.jpg and others. I need to pick one, maybe the first one mentioned. Wait, the facts mention "Southern California possui imagem representativa Sdmarina.jpg", so the answer would be Sdmarina.jpg.

5. Which notable person was born in Southern California? There are many names listed, like Jill Barnett, Neal Rubin, etc. I can pick one, maybe Jill Barnett.

6. Which railway line is located in Southern California? The California Central Railway is mentioned. 

7. What is the total area of Southern California in square miles? The answer is 56505. 

8. Which radio station has a broadcast area in Southern California? KFI is listed. 

9. Which county in California has Southern California as a subdivision? Los Angeles County is mentioned. 

10. What is the name of the image with the legend about Southern California? The context mentions "legenda da imagem Images top to bottom..." which might be the one with the legend. Wait, the exact phrase is "Southern California possui legenda da imagem Images top to bottom...". Maybe the answer is "legenda da imagem Images top to bottom...".

Wait, I need to make sure each answer is directly from the facts. Let me check again. For example, the question about the earthquake is covered. The population is given. The image names are listed. People born there include Jill Barnett, Neal Rubin, etc. The railway lines like California Central Railway. Radio stations like KFI. Counties like Los Angeles County. The total area is 56505. The image legend is mentioned as "legenda da imagem Images top to bottom...".

I should avoid repeating similar questions. For example, not multiple questions about people born there. Let me structure the 10 pairs accordingly, ensuring each is distinct and based on the facts provided.
