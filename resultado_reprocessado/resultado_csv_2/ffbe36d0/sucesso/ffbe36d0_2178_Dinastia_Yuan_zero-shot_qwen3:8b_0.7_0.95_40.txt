Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs based on the Yuan Dynasty context. Let me start by recalling what I know about the Yuan Dynasty. It was established by Kublai Khan in the 13th century, right? The Yuan Dynasty ruled China from 1271 to 1368. They were a Mongol-led dynasty, so I should mention that. The capital was Dadu, which is now Beijing. They had a centralized bureaucracy, and the Mongols were the ruling class. There was a system of ranks for officials, and they promoted Confucianism. Also, the Yuan Dynasty is known for its extensive trade routes, like the Silk Road, and cultural exchanges. They had a postal system called the Yam. The dynasty fell due to internal strife and peasant uprisings, leading to the Ming Dynasty. They also had a policy of ethnic division, with Mongols in high positions and Han Chinese in lower ranks. The Yuan Dynasty's rule was both centralized and had some feudal elements. They used a decimal currency system. The Mongols were known for their military campaigns, and the dynasty had a significant impact on Chinese culture and administration. 

Now, I need to create 10 varied questions. Let me make sure each question covers a different aspect. Let's see: 

1. When was the Yuan Dynasty established? Answer: 1271.
2. Who founded the Yuan Dynasty? Answer: Kublai Khan.
3. What was the capital of the Yuan Dynasty? Answer: Dadu (Beijing).
4. What was the governing system of the Yuan Dynasty? Answer: Centralized bureaucracy with Mongol rule.
5. What was the name of the postal system used by the Yuan Dynasty? Answer: Yam.
6. What was the main reason for the fall of the Yuan Dynasty? Answer: Internal strife and peasant uprisings.
7. How did the Yuan Dynasty handle ethnic groups? Answer: Mongols in high positions, Han Chinese in lower ranks.
8. What was the currency system used during the Yuan Dynasty? Answer: Decimal currency system.
9. What was the impact of the Yuan Dynasty on Chinese culture? Answer: Cultural exchanges and administrative reforms.
10. What was the role of Confucianism during the Yuan Dynasty? Answer: Promoted as part of the bureaucratic system.

Wait, I need to check if these are all correct and not repeating. The first question is about establishment year. The second is about founder. Third about capital. Fourth about governance. Fifth about the postal system. Sixth about the fall. Seventh about ethnic policies. Eighth about currency. Ninth about cultural impact. Tenth about Confucianism. That's 10. Let me make sure each answer is directly from the context provided. Also, ensure that the answers are concise and correct. I think that covers different aspects without repetition. Now, format them into JSON as specified.
