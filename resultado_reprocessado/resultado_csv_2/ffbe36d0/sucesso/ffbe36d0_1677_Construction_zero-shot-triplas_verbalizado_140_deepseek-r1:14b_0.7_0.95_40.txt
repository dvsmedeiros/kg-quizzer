Alright, I need to generate exactly 10 pairs of questions and answers based on the provided context and facts about the construction industry. Let me start by carefully reading through both sections.

First, the context explains that construction involves executing projects like buildings and infrastructure, adhering to technical norms. It also mentions terms used in Brazil, such as "obra" for larger structures and "reforma" for smaller changes. 

The facts list various companies and their relation to the construction industry. Each fact states which company belongs to Construction, what product they offer, or other relevant details.

My task is to create varied questions covering different aspects from the context and facts. I should ensure each question has a single correct answer that's directly supported by the information given. Also, no repeating similar questions.

I'll brainstorm possible angles: definitions, examples of construction activities, companies in the industry, related terms (like derivative or hyperonym), and specific roles or products within construction.

Let me outline 10 potential topics:

1. Definition of Construction.
2. Types of structures built.
3. Terms used in Brazil for construction projects.
4. Example of a construction-related service.
5. A company known for construction activities.
6. Hyperonym related to construction.
7. Sector where architects work.
8. Countries with significant construction output.
9. An occupation within the construction industry.
10. Correct term for building structures.

Now, I'll form questions and their corresponding answers based on these topics:

1. What is the execution of a previously designed project called? Answer: Construction.

2. Which term refers to smaller changes or repairs in buildings? Answer: Reforma.

3. What type of structure requires "obra"? Answer: Pontes (bridges).

4. Name an activity related to construction services. Answer: Shipbuilding.

5. Identify a company active in the construction sector. Answer: Aoki Corporation.

6. Which hyperonym is associated with Construction? Answer: Generalizations of the derivative.

7. What sector do architects belong to? Answer: Construction.

8. List a country known for its construction output. Answer: Brazil.

9. Name an occupation within the construction industry. Answer: Bricklayer.

10. What term refers to building structures? Answer: Construction.

I think these cover various aspects without repetition and each has a clear, correct answer from the provided data.
