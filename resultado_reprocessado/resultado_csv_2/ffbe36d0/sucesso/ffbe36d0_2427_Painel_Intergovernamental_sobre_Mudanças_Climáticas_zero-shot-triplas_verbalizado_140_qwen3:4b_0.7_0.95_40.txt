Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs based on the provided context and facts about the IPCC. Let me start by carefully reading through the given information to make sure I understand all the key points.

First, the context explains that the IPCC is a scientific and political organization established in 1988 under the UN by PNUMA and WMO. Its main goal is to synthesize and disseminate the latest knowledge on climate change, specifically global warming, its causes, effects, and risks. It doesn't conduct original research but compiles work from independent scientists. It's the main authority for climate policies and has received Nobel Peace Prize in 2007. The facts list various types, categories, and related entities, including its headquarters in Geneva, its relation to the UN and WMO, and some notable people associated with it.

Now, I need to create questions that cover different aspects. Let me list possible topics: what is the full name, when was it established, what's its main purpose, which organizations it's related to, where is it based, its role in climate policies, Nobel Prize, types of organizations it's categorized under, and some key people associated with it.

I should make sure each question is unique and based on the facts. Let me check the facts again to ensure the answers are accurate. For example, the full name is Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, established in 1988, main purpose is to synthesize climate change knowledge, related to UN and WMO, based in Geneva, Nobel Prize in 2007, types like YagoLegalActor, WikicatUnitedNations, etc. Also, some people like Filippo Giorgi and Kevin Trenberth are associated with it.

I need to avoid repeating the same topic. So, I can ask about the full name, establishment year, purpose, parent organizations, headquarters, Nobel Prize, types of categories, associated people, and maybe the role in policies. Wait, the user mentioned "different aspects," so I should cover various angles.

Let me start drafting the questions:

1. What is the full name of the organization known as IPCC?
2. When was the IPCC established?
3. What is the main purpose of the IPCC?
4. Which organizations is the IPCC related to?
5. Where is the IPCC based?
6. What award did the IPCC receive in 2007?
7. What are some of the categories or types that the IPCC is classified under?
8. Who are some notable individuals associated with the IPCC?
9. What is the role of the IPCC in global climate policies?
10. What is the main function of the IPCC according to the text?

Now, I need to check if these questions are all based on the provided facts. Let me verify each one against the context and facts:

1. Yes, the full name is given.
2. Established in 1988.
3. Synthesize and disseminate climate change knowledge.
4. Related to UN and WMO.
5. Based in Geneva.
6. Nobel Peace Prize.
7. Categories like YagoLegalActor, WikicatUnitedNations, etc.
8. Filippo Giorgi, Kevin Trenberth, etc.
9. Main base for global climate policies.
10. Main function is to synthesize and disseminate knowledge.

That seems to cover different aspects. Now, I need to make sure each answer is correct and directly from the text. Also, check if the questions are in Portuguese and the answers are accurate. Let me also check if any of the facts are not covered. For example, the fact that it's a working group (WikicatWorkingGroups) could be part of the categories. Also, the fact that it has a headquarters in Geneva is covered.

I think that's all. Now, I'll structure the JSON with these 10 pairs.
