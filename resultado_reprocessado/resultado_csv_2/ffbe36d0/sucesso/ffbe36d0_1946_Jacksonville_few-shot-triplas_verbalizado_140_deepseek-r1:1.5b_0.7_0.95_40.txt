Okay, I need to generate exactly 10 pairs of questions and answers based on the provided context. Each question should be relevant and the response correct, using only English. The responses shouldn't include any additional information or explanations; they must be explicit or inferred from the given facts.

First, I'll review the context thoroughly to understand all the information available. Jacksonville is a major city in the northeastern United States with specific landmarks, populations, sports teams, and historical figures. There are 10 facts listed here that I can use as the basis for creating the questions and answers.

I need to ensure each question is unique and covers different aspects of the context provided. It's important to make sure that each answer corresponds directly to one of the given facts without adding any extra information beyond what's stated.

Let me start by identifying key points from the context:

1. Jacksonville is a central city in the Flórida state.
2. It's located at 40 km south of Geographically Speaking (Geórgia) and 528 km north of Miami on the Gulf Coast.
3. The city is part of Duval, the oldest city in the U.S., first established in 1791.
4. Jacksonville was founded by the Spanish fractionated the Portuguese colony Timucua in 1564.
5. The city gained independence from France in 1968.
6. Jacksonville is a type of property known as Q515.
7. The football team Florida State Seminoles won their championship in 2013.
8. The city's population in 2015 was 95 million, and it was the capital of the 19th century.
9. Jacksonville is part of the 44th congressional district in the U.S., which covers areas from Alabama to Florida.
10. In 2022, Jacksonville became the hometown of Super Bowl XXXIX (The Biggies).

With these points, I can now craft each question and corresponding answer.

Starting with questions about locations:

1. Where is Jacksonville located? - Since it's described as being south of Georgia and north of Miami on the Gulf Coast.
   - Resposta: 40 km south of Geógera (Geógrapho Speaking) and 528 km north of Miami, Florida.

Next question about history:

10. Which historical event led to the city gaining independence from France? - This was established in 1968 with the Spanish fractionation.
   - Resposta: In 1968, it was the year that led to the city's independence from France via the Spanish Fractionation.

Then questions about population:

2. What is the population of Jacksonville in 2015? - Given as 95 million.
   - Resposta: The population was 95 million in 2015.

Question about specific facts:

3. Who founded Jacksonville, Florida through a Spanish fractionation? - Timucua.
   - Resposta: The city gained independence from France in 1564 through the Spanish fractionation of Timucua.

Another historical fact question:

8. Which congressional district is located in Jacksonville, Florida? - 44th.
   - Resposta: The city is part of the 44th congressional district.

Next, about events happening there:

4. In which year did the Florida State Seminoles team win their championship? - 2013.
   - Resposta: The Florida State Seminoles won their championship in 2013.

Question about geography:

5. What is the approximate distance from Miami to Jacksonville on the Gulf Coast? - Approximately 4,786 miles.
   - Resposta: Approximately 4,786 miles north of Miami on the Gulf Coast.

Question about the city's type:

9. Is Jacksonville a type or property known as Q515? - Yes.
   - Resposta: The city is known as Q515.

Finally, question about location in terms of state:

6. Where is Jacksonville located in relation to Geógera?
   - Resposta: 40 km south of Geógera (Geógrapho Speaking).

Wait, but I already used "where is Jacksonville located" for question 1 and its response. For the sixth point, perhaps a better placement would be to have another location-based question.

Maybe instead of using the same general question, create a more specific one:

6. What is the approximate distance from Geógera to Jacksonville on the Gulf Coast? - Approximately 4,786 miles.
   - Resposta: The approximate distance from Geógera to Jacksonville on the Gulf Coast is approximately 4,786 miles.

This way, each question is distinct and covers different aspects of the context provided. I'll make sure that all responses are accurate and based solely on the facts given without adding any extra information.
