Alright, I need to generate exactly 10 pairs of questions and answers based on the provided context about oxygen. Each question must be relevant, varied, and cover different aspects of the content. The answers should be correct and either explicit or inferable from the text.

First, I'll review the context thoroughly to identify key points:

- Oxygen's atomic number is 8.
- Symbol O.
- Mass is 16 u.
- Group: Chalcogens (calcogênio in Portuguese).
- Second highest electronegativity after fluorine.
- Abundance: third most abundant by mass, behind hydrogen and helium. Makes up almost half of Earth's crust as part of oxides.
- At standard conditions, it forms O2 gas, which makes up ~20.8% of Earth's atmosphere.
- Role in photosynthesis and respiration.
- Discovery by Antoine Lavoisier.
- Uses include medical, space exploration, water treatment, steel production, rocket fuels.
- Concerns: ozone layer depletion, pollution.

Now, I'll brainstorm potential questions:

1. What is oxygen's atomic number?
2. How much of the Earth's crust is oxygen?
3. What gas makes up 20.8% of the atmosphere?
4. Which group does oxygen belong to?
5. Who discovered oxygen?
6. What are its main uses?
7. Where is it most abundant in the universe?
8. Why is it essential for life?
9. What's the chemical formula of molecular oxygen?
10. How did the ozone hole form?

I need to ensure each question is clear and the answers directly relate to the context provided.

Wait, I should check if all these points are covered in the context. For example, the discovery by Lavoisier is mentioned, so that's a good question. Uses like medical and steel production are also covered, making another relevant question.

I'll structure each pair ensuring they're distinct and cover different aspects: properties, abundance, atmosphere composition, scientific discoveries, uses, etc.

Here are 10 pairs of questions and answers based on the context provided about oxygen:

1. **What is the atomic number of oxygen?**  
   - Answer: 8.

2. **How much of the Earth's crust is composed of oxygen?**  
   - Answer: Almost half.

3. **Which gas makes up approximately 20.8% of Earth's atmosphere?**  
   - Answer: O₂ (Oxygen).

4. **To which group in the periodic table does oxygen belong?**  
   - Answer: Chalcogens (Calcogênio in Portuguese).

5. **Who discovered oxygen?**  
   - Answer: Antoine Lavoisier.

6. **What are some of the main uses of oxygen?**  
   - Answer: Medical purposes, space exploration, water treatment, steel production, and rocket fuels.

7. **Where is oxygen most abundant in the universe?**  
   - Answer: In stars as part of fusion processes.

8. **Why is oxygen essential for life on Earth?**  
   - Answer: It is required for cellular respiration in most organisms and plays a key role in photosynthesis.

9. **What is the chemical formula of molecular oxygen?**  
   - Answer: O₂.

10. **How was the ozone hole formed?**  
    - Answer: Due to the release of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) that destroy ozone molecules in the atmosphere.

These questions and answers cover various aspects of oxygen, including its properties, abundance, atmospheric presence, scientific discovery, uses, and environmental impact.
