Okay, so I have to generate 10 pairs of questions and correct answers based on the provided context about oxygen. Let me read through the context carefully first.

The context starts by explaining that oxygen is a chemical element with atomic number 8, symbol O. It's in the group of nonmetals and is a strong oxidizing agent. It has the second highest electronegativity after fluorine. Oxygen is abundant on Earth as part of compounds like oxides. At standard conditions, two atoms form O2 gas, which makes up about 20.8% of the atmosphere. However, oxygen levels are decreasing due to fossil fuel emissions.

Oxygen is used in respiration and is a key component in organic molecules like proteins, nucleic acids, carbohydrates, and lipids. It's also crucial for life processes such as photosynthesis, which produces O2. The liquid form is blue and odorless. Oxygen supports combustion but isn't itself combustible.

Historically, oxygen was discovered by Carl Wilhelm Scheele in 1773 and independently by Joseph Priestley in 1774, with Lavoisier later naming it. It's used in various applications like welding, cutting metals, and medical uses such as hyperbaric therapy. The name "oxygen" comes from the Greek words "oxys" (acid-like) and "gonos" (to produce), based on the old belief that acids needed oxygen.

Now, looking at the facts provided, they list various entities related to oxygen: Antoine Lavoisier is known for discovering it, Mars and Mercury's atmospheres contain oxygen, companies like BOC Kenya Limited sell oxygen, bottled oxygen is a product, breathing gas is related to oxygen, Scheele discovered it, Hope Street album's title relates to oxygen, Inox Air Products produces it, Priestley also discovered it, Kaldo converter uses it, Michael Sendivogius wrote about it, and there are several RD numbers that reference oxygen.

From the context, I can infer that each question should be based on different aspects of oxygen. The questions need to vary and cover different topics like its chemical properties, discovery, applications, usage in various contexts (atmospheric, industrial, medical), and its role in life processes.

I should avoid repeating similar questions. Each response must be exact and directly related to the context provided. Let me brainstorm possible questions:

1. What is the atomic number of oxygen?
2. Who was responsible for naming oxygen after its discovery?
3. Which gas constitutes about 20% of Earth's atmosphere?
4. What element has a higher electronegativity than oxygen?
5. How many atoms combine to form O2 at standard conditions?
6. What process is responsible for increasing oxygen levels in the atmosphere?
7. Where is oxygen used in medical treatments?
8. Which substance is blue and odorless when in liquid form?
9. Who was a key figure in discovering oxygen besides Lavoisier?
10. Why does oxygen support combustion?

Now, I'll check each against the context to ensure accuracy.

1. Atomic number: 8.
2. Named by Lavoisier after his work.
3. O2 is about 20% of atmosphere.
4. Fluorine has higher electronegativity.
5. Two atoms form O2.
6. Photosynthesis increases oxygen levels.
7. Hyperbaric therapy uses pure oxygen.
8. Liquid oxygen is blue and odorless.
9. Priestley also discovered it.
10. Oxygen supports combustion due to its oxidizing properties.

I think these cover a range of topics without repetition. Now, I can structure each as a question and answer pair.
