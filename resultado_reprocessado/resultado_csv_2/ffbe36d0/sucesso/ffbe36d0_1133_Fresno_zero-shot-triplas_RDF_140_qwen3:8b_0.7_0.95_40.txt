Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs based on the provided data about Fresno, California. Let me start by going through the data to identify key points and entities mentioned.

First, the data includes various properties of Fresno, like its area code (559), population (though not explicitly stated, maybe inferred from area total?), government type (Strong Mayor), and coordinates (36.75, -119.7667). There are also mentions of nearby places like the San Joaquin Valley, and some cultural aspects like the Sun-Maid company and the Royal Rumble (1996) event. Additionally, there are references to people born or residing in Fresno, such as Larry Levis, Michael Weaver, and others. There are also radio stations and other facilities located there.

Now, I should create questions that are factual and based on these entities. Let me brainstorm possible questions:

1. What is the area code for Fresno, California?
   - Answer: 559

2. What is the government type of Fresno?
   - Answer: Strong Mayor

3. What is the total area of Fresno in square miles?
   - Wait, the data says ns4:areaTotal "300.438620798976". Need to check if that's in square miles. But the unit isn't specified. Maybe it's in square kilometers or another unit. Wait, the data might have a mistake here. Alternatively, maybe it's in square miles. But I need to be cautious. Alternatively, the area code is 559, which is a known fact, so that's safe.

Wait, the user might have a different structure. Let me check again. The data shows ns4:areaTotal "300.438620798976" – but the unit isn't specified. Maybe it's in square miles? For example, Fresno's actual area is about 266 square miles. But the data says 300.44. Maybe that's a mistake. However, I have to use the data as provided. So the answer would be 300.44 square miles? Or maybe it's in another unit. But without the unit, it's ambiguous. Maybe the user expects the exact value from the data. So I'll include that, but note that the unit isn't specified.

Alternatively, maybe the areaTotal is in square kilometers. Let me check: 300.44 square kilometers would be about 116 square miles. But Fresno's actual area is around 266 square miles. Hmm, this might be an error in the data. But since I have to use the data as given, I'll proceed with the provided value.

4. What is the population of Fresno? – Wait, the data doesn't mention population. The areaTotal is given, but not population. So I can't answer that. So I need to avoid that.

5. What are the coordinates of Fresno?
   - Answer: 36.75° N, 119.7667° W

6. What is the nearest city to Jennie Lakes Wilderness?
   - Answer: Fresno, California

7. Which radio stations are located in Fresno?
   - The data lists several, like KFTV-DT, KMGV, KJWL, etc. So a question could be: Which radio stations are based in Fresno, California? Answer: KFTV-DT, KMGV, KJWL, KRDU, KRZR, KSKS, KSOF, KWYE, KXEX, and others.

8. What event is associated with Fresno, California?
   - The Royal Rumble (1996) is mentioned, so the answer could be the Royal Rumble (1996) event.

9. Who are some notable people born in Fresno?
   - Larry Levis, Michael Weaver (golfer), Mike Pronovost, Millard Hampton, etc.

10. What is the name of the company based in Fresno?
    - Sun-Maid is mentioned as a company located in Fresno.

Wait, let me check again. The data says "Sun-Maid" has a locationCity of Fresno. So that's a valid point.

Now, I need to ensure that each question is distinct and answers are accurate based on the data. Let me compile the 10 pairs now.
