Alright, so I need to generate 10 pairs of questions and answers based on the provided context about the Scottish Parliament. Let me start by reading through the context carefully.

The context mentions that the Scottish Parliament is unicameral, located in Edinburgh, with 129 MSPs elected every four years using a mixed proportional system. The last election was in May 2016, and it was established by the Scotland Act 1998 after devolution from the UK.

Looking at the facts section, there's a lot of information about constituencies, committees, images, models, etc. I need to extract key points that can form varied questions.

I should ensure each question is unique and covers different aspects: structure, history, electoral system, establishment, leadership, committees, location, types of members, etc.

Let me brainstorm possible questions:

1. Where is the Scottish Parliament located? (Edinburgh)
2. What's the name of its building? (Scottish Parliament Building)
3. How many MSPs are there? (129)
4. Under what system are they elected? (Additional member system)
5. When was it established? (Scotland Act 1998)
6. What's the name of the current Presiding Officer? (Alison Johnstone)
7. Which electoral region has the most constituencies? (Lothian with 7 MSPs)
8. How long are the terms? (4 years)
9. What committees does it have? (Economy, Energy and Tourism; Education, etc.)
10. When was the last election? (5 May 2021)

Wait, in the context, the last general election is mentioned as 5 May 2016, but the facts say "Scottish Parliament teve data de eleição do líder 2021-05-13" which translates to leader election date on 13 May 2021. Maybe that's a different election.

I think I should cross-check dates. The context says last general election in 2016, but the facts mention 2021-05-06 as the last participated election. Hmm, perhaps it's better to confirm from the data provided.

Wait, looking at the facts again: "A última eleição geral para o parlamento escocês foi realizada em 5 de Maio de 2016." So that's the general election date.

But another fact says "Scottish Parliament participou da eleição 2021-05-06" which is May 6, 2021. Maybe that was a by-election or regional election?

I need to be careful with dates. For simplicity, I'll take the last general election as 2016.

Now, let me list the questions ensuring they cover various aspects without overlapping:

1. Location of the Scottish Parliament.
2. Name of its building.
3. Number of members (MSPs).
4. Electoral system used.
5. Year it was established.
6. Current Presiding Officer.
7. Largest electoral region by constituencies.
8. Term duration for MSPs.
9. Example committees.
10. Date of the last general election.

Wait, but in the example provided, some questions are more conceptual, like about devolution or powers. Maybe I should include one about devolved powers as well.

Alternatively, since the facts mention various constituencies and electoral regions, perhaps a question on how many constituencies are in a specific region.

Let me adjust to ensure variety:

1. Location of Scottish Parliament.
2. Name of its building.
3. Number of MSPs.
4. Type of election system (AMS).
5. Year established by Scotland Act.
6. Current Presiding Officer's name.
7. Largest electoral region with 7 constituencies.
8. How long are terms? 4 years.
9. Key committees (Economy, Education).
10. Date of last general election.

Yes, that seems to cover a good range without repetition. Now, I can structure each question and answer accordingly.
