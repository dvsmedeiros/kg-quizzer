Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs based on the provided context and facts about oxygen. Let me start by reading through the context carefully to understand the key points. The context talks about oxygen's properties, its role in the atmosphere, its chemical structure, its importance in life, and some historical facts about its discovery.

First, I'll identify different aspects of oxygen that can be turned into questions. The context mentions that oxygen is the second most electronegative element, so that's a good point. Also, its abundance in the universe and Earth's crust. Then there's the fact that it's diatomic (O2) and its role in respiration. The historical discovery by Scheele and Priestley, and Lavoisier's contribution. Also, the ozone layer and its role in protecting against UV radiation. The environmental impact, like the decrease in atmospheric oxygen due to fossil fuel combustion. Applications in various industries, medical uses, and its presence in compounds like water and organic molecules.

Now, looking at the facts provided, there are mentions of companies like Inox Air Products and BOC Kenya Limited producing oxygen, as well as images and categories related to oxygen. But the main focus should be on the context provided, not the facts. Wait, the user says to base the questions on the context and facts. But the instructions say to generate questions and answers based on the context and facts provided. Wait, the user included both a context and a list of facts. But the main content is the context about oxygen. The facts might be additional data, but the primary source is the context. However, the user might have intended to include both. But the initial instruction says "gerar pares de perguntas e respostas relevantes e corretas, exclusivamente a partir do conteúdo fornecido." The content provided is the context and the facts. Wait, the context is the main body, and the facts are a list of additional data. But the user says "exclusivamente a partir do conteúdo fornecido" which includes both the context and the facts. So I need to consider both.

But maybe the user wants the questions to be based on the context, and the facts are just additional data. However, the user might have included the facts to provide more data points. Wait, looking at the facts, there are mentions of categories like Category:Oxidizing agents, Category:Chalcogens, and various images. Also, some technical terms like E-number additives, chemical models, and templates. But the main context is about oxygen's properties, discovery, role in the environment, etc. So perhaps the questions should be based on the context, and the facts might have some additional info, but the main focus is the context.

So, I need to make sure that the questions are based on the context. Let me list out key points from the context:

1. Oxygen is element number 8, symbol O, atomic mass 16 u.
2. Part of chalcogens, reactive nonmetal, strong oxidizing agent.
3. Second most electronegative element (after fluorine).
4. Third most abundant in the universe, most abundant in Earth's crust as oxides.
5. Diatomic gas (O2), 20.8% of atmosphere, essential for life.
6. Atmospheric oxygen levels are decreasing due to fossil fuel combustion.
7. Physical properties: colorless, odorless, insoluble, supports combustion.
8. Used in respiration, organic molecules, inorganic compounds like bones, teeth.
9. Majority of living organisms' mass is oxygen, mostly in water.
10. Reactivity leads to needing constant replenishment via photosynthesis.
11. Ozzone (O3) absorbs UV, protects biosphere, but is a pollutant near surface.
12. Oxygen was discovered by Scheele (1773) and Priestley (1774), Lavoisier named it.
13. Name from Greek words meaning "acid" and "producer".
14. Applications in industry, medical uses, space missions.
15. Mention of companies producing oxygen like Inox Air Products and BOC Kenya Limited.

Now, I need to create 10 questions that cover different aspects. Let me start:

1. What is the atomic number of oxygen?
   Answer: 8.

2. What is the most abundant element in the Earth's crust, excluding oxygen itself?
   Wait, the context says oxygen is the most abundant in Earth's crust as part of oxides, so the answer would be oxygen. But maybe the question is about the most abundant element in the crust, which is oxygen. Wait, the context says "o mais abundante na crosta terrestre como parte de compostos óxidos, formando praticamente metade da sua massa." So the answer is oxygen. But maybe the question could be "Which element is the most abundant in Earth's crust as part of oxides?" Answer: Oxygen.

3. What is the chemical symbol for oxygen?
   Answer: O.

4. What is the molecular formula of diatomic oxygen?
   Answer: O2.

5. What is the percentage of oxygen in the Earth's atmosphere?
   Answer: 20.8%.

6. What is the primary reason for the decreasing levels of oxygen in the atmosphere?
   Answer: Emissions from the combustion of fossil fuels.

7. What is the role of oxygen in the process of photosynthesis?
   Answer: It is replenished by photosynthesis.

8. What is the name of the ozone layer and its role?
   Answer: The ozone layer (O3) absorbs UV radiation, protecting the biosphere.

9. Who discovered oxygen first, Carl Wilhelm Scheele or Joseph Priestley?
   Answer: Carl Wilhelm Scheele (1773), though Priestley's work was published first.

Wait, the context says "O oxigénio foi descoberto autonomamente por Carl Wilhelm Scheele em Uppsala, no ano de 1773, e por Joseph Priestley em Wiltshire no ano de 1774, no entanto é Priestley quem costuma ser designado prioritariamente, uma vez que a sua obra foi a primeira a ser publicada." So the correct answer is Scheele discovered it first, but Priestley is often credited. So the question could be "Who was the first to discover oxygen?" Answer: Carl Wilhelm Scheele.

10. What is the primary component of water, which makes up a significant portion of living organisms?
    Answer: Oxygen.

Alternatively, maybe the question about the name origin. The context mentions the name comes from Greek words for "acid" and "producer". So the question could be "What is the origin of the name 'oxygen'?" Answer: From Greek words meaning "acid" and "producer".

But I need to ensure that the questions are based on the context and that the answers are accurate. Let me check for any possible errors. Also, the user specified to use the context and facts, but the main content is the context. The facts may include some additional info, but the main focus is the context. So I'll proceed with the questions based on the context.
