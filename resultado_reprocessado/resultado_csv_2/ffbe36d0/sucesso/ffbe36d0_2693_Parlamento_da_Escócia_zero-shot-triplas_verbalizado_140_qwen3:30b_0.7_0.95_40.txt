Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs based on the provided context and facts about the Scottish Parliament. Let me start by reading through the context and facts carefully.

First, the context mentions that the Scottish Parliament is a unicameral legislative body in Edinburgh, with 129 MSPs elected every four years using a mixed proportional representation system. There are 73 constituency MSPs and 52 regional ones. The last election was in 2016, but there's a fact stating the next election is on 2021-05-07. Wait, that might be a typo since the context says the last election was in 2016, but the facts mention 2021-05-07 as the next election. Maybe the user made an error, but I should stick to the facts provided.

Looking at the facts, there are a lot of entries about constituencies, committees, election dates, leaders, and other details. I need to make sure each question is unique and covers different aspects. Let me brainstorm possible questions.

1. How many MSPs are there, and how are they distributed? The context says 129 total, 73 constituency, 52 regional. That's a good question.

2. When was the last election? The context says 2016, but the facts mention 2021-05-07. Wait, the context says "A última eleição geral para o parlamento escocês foi realizada em 5 de Maio de 2016." However, the facts mention "Scottish Parliament possui próxima eleição --05-07". Maybe the next election after 2016 was in 2021? But the user might have conflicting info. I should check the facts again. The fact says "Scottish Parliament possui próxima eleição --05-07" which might be 2021-05-07, but the context says the last was 2016. So the answer should be 2016 as per context, but the fact says next election is 2021. Hmm. The user might have a mistake, but since the context is the main source, I'll go with 2016 for the last election and 2021 for the next one as per the fact.

3. What is the voting system? The context says "sistema de representação proporcional mista" which is the Additional Member System. The facts also mention "Scottish Parliament possui sistema de votação Additional member system". So that's a valid question.

4. Who is the current leader? The context says "A atual presidente é ." but it's empty. However, the facts mention "Scottish Parliament possui líder Alison Johnstone" and "Scottish Parliament possui líder George Adam". Wait, maybe there's a mistake here. The context might have a placeholder, but the facts have specific names. I need to check if the facts are reliable. Since the user provided the facts, I should use them. So the answer would be Alison Johnstone and George Adam? But the context says "presidente" (president) and the facts have "líder" (leader) which could be different roles. The Presiding Officer is the leader, so maybe Alison Johnstone is the Presiding Officer. The facts also mention "Presiding Officer of the Scottish Parliament pertence ao departamento Scottish Parliament", so the answer would be Alison Johnstone.

5. What are the main committees? The context doesn't list them, but the facts mention several, like "Scottish Parliamentary Pensions Scheme", "Economy, Energy and Tourism", "Europe and External Relations", "Equal Opportunities", "Rural Affairs and Environment", "Finance", etc. So a question about committees could be "What are the main committees of the Scottish Parliament?" but the answer needs to be specific. However, the user might want specific names. Maybe pick a few from the facts.

6. Where is the Scottish Parliament located? The context says "localizado na área de Holyrood da capital Edimburgo" and "Scottish Parliament está localizado em Edinburgh". So the answer is Edinburgh.

7. When was the first session after the 1998 Act? The context says "A primeira sessão do novo parlamento aconteceu em 12 de maio de 1999." So the answer is 12 de maio de 1999.

8. What is the structure of the Parliament? The context mentions it's unicameral, and the facts say "Scottish Parliament é do tipo Group100031264" and "Q43229" etc., but those are identifiers. Maybe not useful. Instead, the structure could be unicameral, with 129 MSPs.

9. How many electoral regions are there? The context says 52 regional MSPs, but the facts mention "West Scotland (Scottish Parliament electoral region)" etc. The number isn't specified in the context, but the facts have entries like "West of Scotland (Scottish Parliament electoral region)" and "Lothians (Scottish Parliament electoral region)", but the exact number isn't clear. Maybe the context doesn't mention it, so this question might not be answerable. Alternatively, the user might have a fact stating the number. Wait, the context says "52 regional ones" but doesn't specify how many regions. So this might not be a valid question. Maybe skip this.

10. What is the role of the First Minister? The context says "First Minister of Scotland possui nomeador Scottish Parliament", meaning the Parliament appoints the First Minister. So the answer would be that the Scottish Parliament appoints the First Minister.

I need to ensure each question is unique and based on the context and facts. Let me check the facts again for more points. There's information about the 6th Scottish Parliament, the name of the period, but that's more specific. Also, the facts mention "Scottish Parliament possui nome do período legislativo 6th Scottish Parliament", so a question about the current legislative period could be "What is the current legislative period of the Scottish Parliament?" Answer: 6th Scottish Parliament.

Another fact: "Scottish Parliament está localizado em Scotland" and "Edinburgh", so location is Edinburgh.

Also, "Scottish Parliament possui d yes" and "v yes", but those might be technical terms not relevant here.

So compiling 10 questions:

1. How many members (MSPs) are there in the Scottish Parliament, and how are they distributed?
2. When was the last general election held for the Scottish Parliament?
3. What is the voting system used for electing MSPs?
4. Who is the current Presiding Officer of the Scottish Parliament?
5. What are some of the main committees of the Scottish Parliament?
6. Where is the Scottish Parliament located?
7. When did the first session of the current Parliament take place after the 1998 Act?
8. What is the role of the First Minister of Scotland in relation to the Scottish Parliament?
9. What is the current legislative period of the Scottish Parliament?
10. How many electoral regions are there in the Scottish Parliament?

Wait, the 9th question might not have a clear answer from the context. The context mentions "52 regional ones" but doesn't state the number of regions. However, the facts have entries like "West Scotland (Scottish Parliament electoral region)" and "Lothians (Scottish Parliament electoral region)", but without a total count. So maybe that's not a valid question. Let me replace it with another.

Alternatively, "What is the name of the current legislative period of the Scottish Parliament?" Answer: 6th Scottish Parliament.

Another question: "What is the name of the leader of the Scottish Parliament?" Answer: Alison Johnstone.

So adjusting the 10th question to that.

Now, I need to make sure the answers are accurate based on the context and facts. Let's verify each:

1. 129 MSPs, 73 constituency, 52 regional. Yes.
2. Last election: 2016 (context) vs. 2021 (fact). Since the context is the main source, answer 2016.
3. Additional member system. Yes.
4. Alison Johnstone as Presiding Officer. Yes.
5. Committees: Economy, Energy and Tourism, Europe and External Relations, etc. From facts.
6. Edinburgh. Yes.
7. 12 de maio de 1999. Yes.
8. Appoints the First Minister. Yes.
9. 6th Scottish Parliament. Yes.
10. Leader is Alison Johnstone. Yes.

That's 10. Now, phrasing them correctly in Portuguese.
