Okay, I need to generate exactly 10 pairs of questions and answers based on the provided context and facts. Let's start by understanding the context first.

The context talks about the laws of the European Union (EU) in a specific section. It mentions that the EU has several key areas like common market law, legal scholars John Bell, Henry G. Schermers, etc. The main focus seems to be on the laws and their application within the EU.

From the facts provided, I see that some of them are repetitive and redundant. For example, "Law of the European Union" is mentioned twice, as well as similar points about common market law. This repetition might not add new information, so I should aim for unique questions each time.

Now, looking at the examples given, they cover a variety of topics under EU laws. I should use these themes to create new questions, ensuring each has a clear and direct answer based on the provided facts.

I need to make sure that each question is about different aspects of EU law. Let's brainstorm some areas:

1. **Regulamentos e diretrizes**: These are common legal documents used for regulation in EU member states.
2. **Tratados**: These are fundamental laws established by the EU which influence its framework and other member states' laws.
3. **Parlamento Europeu**: This is a legislative body that represents all EU member states, including the EU itself.
4. **Consegulum**: The rule-of-law body under the EU that enforces EU laws across member states.
5. **Regulativas internas e externas**: These are internal and external regulations applicable in EU member states.
6. **CNPJ (Comissão Nacional da Justiça)**: This is the highest legal authority in the EU, responsible for judicial oversight of member states' laws.
7. **Regulamentos secundários**: These build upon the main EU regulations.
8. **Tratados da Commissiona delegatura Europeia**: These are the fundamental laws of the EU.
9. **Consegulum Europeu**: This is the highest legal authority in the EU, representing all member states and the EU itself.

I can create questions around these themes:

1. What are the main regulatory documents used by EU member states?
2. Which entity handles internal and external regulations in EU member states?
3. Who holds the highest judicial authority in the EU?
4. What bodies compose the legislative body of the EU?
5. What kind of legal documents are built upon the EU's fundamental laws?
6. Which organization oversees the most important EU regulations?
7. What is the entity responsible for creating internal and external rules in EU member states?
8. Who holds the highest legal authority in the EU, encompassing all member states and itself?
9. How do EU member states coordinate their legal frameworks internally?
10. Which body ensures that EU laws are applied uniformly across all EU member states?

Each of these questions should have a clear answer based on the provided facts. Now I'll structure them into pairs with the corresponding answers.
