Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs based on the given data about Victoria, Australia. Let me start by reviewing the provided information. 

First, the data includes various properties of Victoria, such as its area, GDP, postal codes, and some historical events. The examples given in the prompt show that the questions should be about economic aspects, rankings, notable cities, landmarks, and historical events. 

Looking at the examples, the first answer is about a diversified economy. The data mentions "gdpNominalPerCapita" and "areaLandKm". I can ask about the GDP per capita ranking or the size of the area. The second example asks about the state's ranking in GDP, which is "segundo" (second). The third example is about the position in GDP per capita, which is "quarto" (fourth). 

Other data points include the capital city, which is Melbourne, and the largest stadium. The examples also mention historical events like the Lambing Flat riots and the 1857 Buckland riots. The typhoid outbreak in 1854 had over 1,000 deaths. 

I should make sure to cover different aspects: economy, geography, history, and notable places. Let me check the data again. The "subdivisionName" is Australia, so Victoria is a state within Australia. The "areaLandKm" is 227,444 km². The GDP per capita is AU$68,996, which is fourth. 

For the largest stadium, the data doesn't explicitly state it, but the example leaves it blank. Maybe I should avoid that unless there's more info. The examples include questions about the capital city, so I can use that. 

Also, there's mention of postal codes and the "p" property as "Colony of New South Wales". That might relate to history. The "febRecordLowC" is -3.9°C. 

I need to create 10 questions. Let me brainstorm:

1. What is the GDP per capita of Victoria? (Answer: fourth)
2. What is the area of Victoria? (Answer: 227,444 km²)
3. Which city is the capital of Victoria? (Answer: Melbourne)
4. What is the lowest recorded temperature in February in Victoria? (Answer: -3.9°C)
5. How many people died in the 1854 typhoid outbreak in Victoria? (Answer: more than 1,000)
6. What is the main economic activity in Victoria? (Answer: diversified)
7. Where is the influence of Asian culture strongest in Victoria? (Answer: Bendigo)
8. Which historical event is associated with the Lambing Flat riots? (Answer: New South Wales)
9. What is the name of the largest stadium in Victoria? (Answer: not provided, but maybe the MCG)
10. What was the original name of Victoria as a colony? (Answer: Colony of New South Wales)

Wait, the examples have some answers in Portuguese. The user might prefer answers in Portuguese. The original examples have answers in Portuguese. So I need to make sure the answers are in Portuguese. 

Also, some data points are in the examples, like the answer to the GDP ranking being "segundo" (second) and the per capita being "quarto" (fourth). So I should follow that pattern. 

Let me structure the questions and answers accordingly, ensuring they match the examples and the data provided.
