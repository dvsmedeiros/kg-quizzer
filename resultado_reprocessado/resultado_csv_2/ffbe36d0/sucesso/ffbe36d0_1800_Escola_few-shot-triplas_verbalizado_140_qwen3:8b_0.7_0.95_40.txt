Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to generate 10 question-answer pairs based on the provided context and facts. The context talks about the meaning of "school," the structure of education systems, and various schools listed as private. The facts list a bunch of schools, all marked as private.

First, I need to make sure each question is unique and covers different aspects. The examples given in the prompt are about private schools, their funding, selection rights, etc. So I should avoid repeating those topics.

Looking at the context, the key points are:
- The origin of the word "school" meaning discussion or leisure.
- Modern schools as educational institutions with different levels (elementary, secondary, higher education).
- Private schools vs. public systems, their funding, and structure.

The facts list many private schools, so maybe some questions can be about the types of schools or their characteristics. But the user's examples focus more on definitions and differences between school types. Let me check the examples again.

The examples include questions about funding sources, selection rights, terminology differences, etc. So I need to create similar but distinct questions. Let me brainstorm:

1. What is the primary purpose of a school according to the context?
   - Answer: To provide education.

2. What is another term for higher education institutions?
   - Answer: Faculdade or universidade.

3. Which level of education is for adolescents after completing elementary school?
   - Answer: Ensino médio.

4. What is the main difference between public and private schools in terms of funding?
   - Answer: Private schools are funded through tuition and donations, not taxes.

5. What term is used for schools that offer specialized education beyond traditional systems?
   - Answer: Escolas particulares.

6. What is the term for the educational level that includes both elementary and secondary education?
   - Answer: Sistemas formais de educação.

7. Which of the listed schools is an example of a private institution?
   - Answer: Any of the listed schools, like KGiSL Institute of Technology.

8. What is the primary function of a school as described in the context?

9. What is the term used for the educational level that includes higher education?
   - Answer: Ensino superior.

10. What is another term for a private school in some regions?
    - Answer: Escola independente.

Wait, I need to ensure that each question is unique and not overlapping with the examples. Let me check the examples again. The examples have questions about funding, selection rights, terminology differences, etc. So I should avoid repeating those.

Maybe focus on the structure of education levels, the origin of the word "school," and specific examples from the facts. Let me adjust the questions to cover these aspects.

1. According to the context, what was the original meaning of the word "school"?
   - Answer: Discussão ou conferência.

10. What is the term used for the original meaning of the word "school"?
    - Answer: Discussão ou conferência.

But that's similar to the first question. Maybe I need to find another angle. Perhaps the examples can be about the structure of education levels, the origin of the word, and specific examples from the facts. Let me make sure each question is distinct and covers different aspects.
