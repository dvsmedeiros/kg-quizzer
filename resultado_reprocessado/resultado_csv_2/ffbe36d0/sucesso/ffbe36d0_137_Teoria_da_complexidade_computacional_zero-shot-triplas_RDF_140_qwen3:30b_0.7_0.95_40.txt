Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs based on the given context and facts. Let me start by understanding the context. The context is about computational complexity theory, which is part of theoretical computer science and mathematics. It deals with classifying computational problems based on their resource usage and exploring relationships between these classifications. A computational problem is a task solved by a computer, often via algorithms.

Now, looking at the facts provided. There's a lot of RDF data here, mentioning various people and their academic disciplines or fields related to computational complexity theory. For example, Christos Papadimitriou, David Shmoys, Georg Gottlob, etc., are all linked to computational complexity theory. There are also mentions of resources like "Computational complexity classes" and various templates and categories related to the topic.

The user wants 10 pairs, each with a question and a correct answer, in Portuguese. The questions must be varied, cover different aspects, and be directly related to the content. No repetition of similar questions. The answers must be explicit or inferable from the context.

First, I'll list possible aspects from the context:

1. Definition of computational complexity theory.
2. What it focuses on (classification of problems, resource usage).
3. Examples of people associated with the field.
4. Related concepts like algorithms, problems, resources (time, space).
5. Categories or classes mentioned (like complexity classes, P, NP, etc.).
6. The role of theoretical computer science and mathematics in this field.
7. How problems are classified (by resource usage).
8. The importance of computational complexity theory.
9. Specific examples of computational problems.
10. The relationship between computational complexity and other fields.

Now, I need to form questions around these aspects. Let me check the facts again to see if there are specific names or terms I can use.

For example, the context mentions that "Computational complexity theory" is linked to various people like Christos Papadimitriou, David Shmoys, etc. Also, there's a mention of "Computational complexity classes" and "Complexity classes" in the Wikipedia link. The DBpedia page for Computational complexity theory has several categories and templates.

So possible questions:

1. What is the main focus of computational complexity theory?
   Answer: Classifying computational problems based on resource usage and exploring relationships between classifications.

2. What is a computational problem?
   Answer: A task solved by a computer, often via algorithms.

3. Who are some researchers associated with computational complexity theory?
   Answer: Christos Papadimitriou, David Shmoys, Georg Gottlob, Irit Dinur, etc.

4. What are the resources that computational complexity theory considers?
   Answer: Time, space, etc. (though the context doesn't specify, but the question can be inferred from "classificação de problemas computacionais de acordo com seu uso de recursos")

5. What is the role of theoretical computer science in computational complexity theory?
   Answer: It's a part of theoretical computer science and mathematics that deals with this classification.

6. What is the significance of computational complexity theory?
   Answer: It helps understand the inherent difficulty of computational problems.

7. What are some categories or classes related to computational complexity theory?
   Answer: Complexity classes like P, NP, etc. (though the context mentions "Computational complexity classes" as a title, so that's a possible answer).

8. How are computational problems classified?
   Answer: By their resource usage (time, space, etc.).

9. What is the relationship between computational complexity theory and algorithms?
   Answer: Algorithms are used to solve computational problems, which are then classified by complexity theory.

10. What is the purpose of studying computational complexity theory?
    Answer: To understand the efficiency and feasibility of solving computational problems.

Wait, but the context mentions that computational complexity theory is part of theoretical computer science and mathematics. Also, the facts list many people associated with it. So maybe some questions can be about the people.

But the user wants the answers to be explicit or inferable. For example, "Who is associated with computational complexity theory?" The answer could be the names listed, but since there are many, maybe a general answer like "Researchers such as Christos Papadimitriou, David Shmoys, and Irit Dinur."

But the user wants the answers to be correct based on the given context. Let me check the facts again. The facts have entries like:

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Christos_Papadimitriou> ns1:academicDiscipline <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Computational_complexity_theory> .

So Christos Papadimitriou's academic discipline is computational complexity theory. Similarly for others. So a question could be "Who is an example of a researcher in computational complexity theory?" and the answer would be Christos Papadimitriou, David Shmoys, etc.

But the user wants 10 pairs, so I need to make sure each question is unique and covers different aspects.

Another angle: The context mentions that computational complexity theory is about classifying problems according to resource usage. So a question could be "What does computational complexity theory focus on?" with the answer being classifying problems by resource usage.

Another fact is that the DBpedia page for Computational complexity theory has categories like "Category:Computational_complexity_theory" and "Category:Computational_fields_of_study". So a question could be "What categories are associated with computational complexity theory?" and the answer would be those categories.

Also, the DBpedia page has a title "Computational complexity classes" which might refer to complexity classes like P, NP, etc.

Another fact is that the page uses templates like "Template:ComplexityClasses", so maybe a question about the templates used.

But I need to make sure the answers are directly from the context. For example, the context says that computational complexity theory is part of theoretical computer science and mathematics. So a question could be "In which fields is computational complexity theory categorized?" with the answer being theoretical computer science and mathematics.

Another point: The context mentions that a computational problem is a task resolved by a computer via algorithms. So a question could be "What is a computational problem?" with the answer being a task solved by a computer using algorithms.

Also, the context mentions that the DBpedia page has a description about "classifying computational problems based on their resource usage and exploring relationships between these classifications." So that can be a question.

Putting this all together, here's a list of possible questions and answers:

1. O que é a teoria da complexidade computacional?
   Resposta: Uma área da ciência da computação teórica e matemática que se dedica à classificação de problemas computacionais com base no uso de recursos e à exploração das relações entre essas classificações.

7. Quais são as categorias associadas à teoria da complexidade computacional?
   Resposta: Categorias como "Complexity classes" e "Computational fields of study".

8. Como os problemas computacionais são classificados?
   Resposta: Com base no uso de recursos, como tempo e espaço.

9. Qual é a relação entre a teoria da complexidade computacional e os algoritmos?
   Resposta: Algoritmos são utilizados para resolver problemas computacionais, que são então classificados pela teoria da complexidade.

10. O que é o título da página da teoria da complexidade computacional no DBpedia?
    Resposta: "Computational complexity classes".

I need to check if these answers are directly inferable from the context. For example, the first answer is directly from the context's first sentence. The second answer is from the context's definition. The third answer is from the list of people in the facts. The fourth answer is inferred from "uso de recursos" in the context. The fifth answer is from the context's mention of being part of theoretical computer science and mathematics. The sixth answer is inferred from the purpose of studying complexity theory. The seventh answer is from the dcterms:subject in the facts. The eighth answer is from the context's focus on resource usage. The ninth answer is inferred from the role of algorithms in solving problems. The tenth answer is from the ns2:title in the facts.

I think these are all valid. Now, I need to ensure the Portuguese is correct and the answers are accurate.
