Okay, let's tackle this query. The user provided a bunch of RDF data about Jacksonville, Florida, and some example questions and answers. They want me to generate 10 more question-answer pairs based on the given data.

First, I need to parse the RDF triples to extract relevant information. The key data points about Jacksonville include its population rank (12th), population density (490.63 per km²), population metro (1,733,937), established title "Founded", and other climate stats like February low temperature (46.1°F) and June precipitation (7.6 inches). There are also nicknames like "Jax", "The River City", etc. Additionally, there are some examples of historical facts, like Fort Caroline (French colony in 1564), Timucua people, Andrew Jackson, and the St. Johns River.

Looking at the examples provided, the questions are factual and based on the data present. The task is to create similar pairs. I need to ensure that each question is answerable with the given data. Let me go through the data again to spot all possible points.

From the RDF data:
- The population rank is 12, so a question about the US ranking is valid.
- The metro population is 1,733,937, which could be used for a question about metro population.
- The population density is 490.63 per km², so a question about density.
- The nicknames are listed, so a question about the nickname.
- The established title is "Founded", but that's vague. Maybe the actual year is in the examples, but the data here says "Founded" without a year. However, the examples have a question about the consolidation in 1968. Wait, the user's examples mention 1968, but the provided data doesn't have that. Maybe that's from the original data not shown here. Hmm, the user's examples might have data not in the current input. So I should stick to the data given here.

Wait, in the provided data, there's "ns1:populationRank "12" ;", which the example uses for the 12th rank. The metro population is "ns1:populationMetro "1733937" ;", which is 1,733,937. So the example's second question is about 2010 population, but here the data is "populationMetro" which might be a different year. However, the user's examples include a question about 2010 with a specific number. Since the current data doesn't include the 2010 figure, maybe that's from the original data, but I can't use it. So I need to base questions strictly on the provided data.

The nicknames are "Jax", "The River City", "The Bold New City of the South". So a question asking for the nicknames would be valid.

The established title is "Founded", but without a year. The examples have a question about consolidation in 1968, which is in the example but not in the provided data. So maybe that's from another source. Since the user's examples include it, but the current data doesn't, I should avoid that unless it's in the data. Wait, in the provided data, there's "ns1:establishedTitle "Founded" ;" but no specific year. So perhaps the user's example is using data not present here. Therefore, I should not include questions about consolidation unless the data has it. The data here doesn't mention 1968, so I need to skip that.

The river is St. Johns, as in the example. The data includes "St. Johns" as part of the nickname? Wait, the nicknames are "The River City", which might refer to the St. Johns River. So a question about the river could be valid.

The population density is 490.63 per km². The example has a question about population density, but the example answer is "490.63", which matches the data here. So that's a valid question.

The climate data includes February low of 46.1°F and June precipitation of 7.6 inches. So questions about these stats are possible.

The exact match to the Wikidata entity Q515, which is a city. The skos:exactMatch is provided, but maybe that's not useful for questions.

The foaf:depiction includes images, but unless there's a question about that, it's probably not needed.

The user's examples include questions like "What is the name of the French colony founded in 1564?" with answer "Fort Caroline,". However, in the provided data, there's no mention of Fort Caroline. So that must be from the original data not included here. Therefore, I should not include that unless it's in the given data. Since the current data doesn't have that, I need to avoid it.

So, based on the provided data, the possible questions are:

1. What is the population rank of Jacksonville in the United States? (Answer: 12th)
2. What is the population of the Jacksonville metropolitan area? (Answer: 1,733,937)
3. What are the nicknames of Jacksonville? (Answer: "Jax", "The River City", "The Bold New City of the South")
4. What is the population density of Jacksonville in people per square kilometer? (Answer: 490.63)
5. What is the average February low temperature in Jacksonville? (Answer: 46.1°F)
6. What is the average June precipitation in Jacksonville in inches? (Answer: 7.6 inches)
7. What river is associated with Jacksonville? (Answer: St. Johns River)
8. What was the lowest temperature recorded in May in Jacksonville? (Answer: 50.7°F)
9. What is the category associated with Jacksonville? (Answer: Category:Jacksonville, Florida)
10. What are the exact matches for Jacksonville's location? (Answer: http://globalwordnet.org/ili/i84298)

Wait, the data includes "ns1:mayAvgRecordLowF "50.7" ;", so a question about the May record low average. The example has a question about May's average record low, which is 50.7°F.

Also, the exact match is a Wikidata ID, but that's more technical. Maybe not necessary for the questions.

So compiling these, the 10 questions could be:

1. What is the population rank of Jacksonville in the United States? (12th)
2. What is the population of the Jacksonville metropolitan area? (1,733,937)
3. What are the nicknames of Jacksonville? ("Jax", "The River City", "The Bold New City of the South")
4. What is the population density of Jacksonville in people per square kilometer? (490.63)
5. What is the average February low temperature in Jacksonville? (46.1°F)
6. What is the average June precipitation in Jacksonville in inches? (7.6 inches)
7. What river is associated with Jacksonville? (St. Johns River)
8. What was the lowest temperature recorded in May in Jacksonville? (50.7°F)
9. What category is associated with Jacksonville? (Category:Jacksonville, Florida)
10. What is the exact match for Jacksonville's location in the global wordnet? (http://globalwordnet.org/ili/i84298)

Wait, but the user's examples include some historical facts that aren't in the provided data. Since I have to use only the given data, I need to exclude those. Therefore, the answers must come from the provided triples.

Also, check for any other data points. The "nSearch" is "Category:Jacksonville, Florida", so that's the 9th question.

The skos:exactMatch is a URL, so that's the 10th question.

So, the 10 pairs would be based on these data points.
