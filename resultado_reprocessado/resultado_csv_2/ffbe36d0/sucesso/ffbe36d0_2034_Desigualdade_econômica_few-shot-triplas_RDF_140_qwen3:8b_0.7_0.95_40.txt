Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to generate 10 question-answer pairs based on the provided context and facts. First, I need to understand the context thoroughly. The main topic is economic inequality, covering distribution of wealth, income, measures like the Gini coefficient, and related concepts like the Human Development Index adjusted for inequality. There are also mentions of globalization's impact and some historical movements related to economic inequality.

Looking at the facts provided, there are various resources and entities linked to economic inequality, such as books, authors, and movements. However, the examples given in the user's prompt don't directly reference these facts. The examples focus on percentages, Oxfam data, and specific figures. But since the user's context doesn't include those specific numbers, I can't use them. Wait, the user provided a context and facts, but the examples they gave are from different sources. Hmm, maybe I should focus solely on the context given, not the examples.

Wait, the user's instruction says to generate questions and answers based on the context and facts provided. The context includes the definition of economic inequality, measures like Gini, HDI adjusted for inequality, and the effect of globalization. The facts are RDF triples, but they might not have specific numerical data. So, I need to derive questions from the context without relying on the examples provided.

Let me list the key points from the context:

1. Economic inequality includes income and wealth distribution.
2. It exists between countries and within countries.
3. Measures include Gini coefficient and HDI adjusted for inequality.
4. Globalization reduced global inequality but increased inequality within countries.
5. Concepts like equity, equality of results, and opportunities are important.
6. Research suggests higher inequality hinders growth duration but not its rate.

Now, I need to create 10 varied questions. Let's think of different aspects:

- What are the two main aspects of economic inequality?
- Which measure is most commonly used to assess economic inequality?
- What is the purpose of the Human Development Index adjusted for inequality?
- How does globalization affect economic inequality globally and within countries?
- What are the three concepts related to equality mentioned?
- What does research suggest about the relationship between inequality and economic growth?
- What types of groups can experience economic inequality?
- How does the Gini coefficient measure economic inequality?
- What is the significance of the HDI adjusted for inequality?
- What are the implications of globalization on inequality within countries?

Now, I need to ensure the answers are accurate based on the context. Let me check each point:

1. Income and wealth distribution.
2. Gini coefficient.
3. Adjusts HDI to account for inequality.
4. Reduces global inequality but increases within-country inequality.
5. Equity, equality of results, opportunities.
6. Higher inequality hinders growth duration but not rate.
7. Between countries and within countries.
8. Measures income/wealth distribution (Gini).
9. Adjusts HDI to reflect inequality.
10. Increased inequality within countries due to globalization.

Now, formulating the questions and answers in Portuguese, as the examples are in Portuguese. Let me make sure the answers are concise and directly from the context. Also, avoid any numbers not mentioned in the context. For example, the user's examples include percentages, but the context here doesn't have those, so I should not include them unless specified. The answer for the Gini coefficient should mention it's the most used measure. The HDI adjusted for inequality is to account for inequality. Globalization's effect is reducing global but increasing within. The three concepts are equity, equality of results, and opportunities. The research says higher inequality hinders growth duration but not rate. Economic inequality exists between and within countries. The Gini coefficient measures income/wealth distribution. HDI adjusted for inequality helps in assessing inequality's impact on development. Globalization's effect on within-country inequality is increased.

Now, structuring the 10 pairs accordingly. Let me ensure they are varied and cover different aspects. Avoid repetition. Check for clarity and correctness based on the context provided.
