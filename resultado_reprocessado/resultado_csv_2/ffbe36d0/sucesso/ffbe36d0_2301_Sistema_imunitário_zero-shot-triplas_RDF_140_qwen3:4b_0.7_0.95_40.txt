Okay, I need to generate 10 objective questions and answers based on the provided context about the immune system. Let me start by carefully reading through the context and facts given.

The context explains the immune system's role in protecting the body, mentions Ilya Mechnikov as the founder, and talks about various components like B cells, T cells, and processes like phagocytosis. It also discusses adaptive immunity, autoimmune diseases, and immunodeficiency conditions. The facts list several entities related to the immune system, like different types of cells and conditions.

First, I should make sure each question is unique and covers different aspects. Let me list out possible topics: the founder of the term, the purpose of the immune system, components of the immune system, types of immunity, immune system components in different organisms, autoimmune diseases, immunodeficiency causes, functions of the immune system, and related conditions like sepsis or food allergies.

Now, I need to form questions around these topics. For example, the first question could be about who coined the term "immune system." Then, the purpose of the immune system. Next, the main components like B cells and T cells. Also, the difference between adaptive and innate immunity. Maybe a question about the role of phagocytosis. Then, what's an example of an autoimmune disease. Also, causes of immunodeficiency. The role of memory in adaptive immunity, and maybe a question about the presence of the immune system in unicellular organisms.

Wait, I need to ensure that each question is based on the provided facts. The facts include various cells and conditions, so I should reference those. For example, the context mentions that the immune system is found in unicellular organisms through enzymes. Also, the example of sepsis being a condition linked to the immune system. Food allergies are also mentioned as a medical cause. 

I need to check that all answers are explicitly or inferable from the text. For instance, the founder is Ilya Mechnikov. The immune system's purpose is to protect against pathogens. The components include B cells, T cells, macrophages, etc. Adaptive immunity involves memory. Autoimmune diseases are like rheumatoid arthritis. Immunodeficiency can be genetic, HIV/AIDS, or due to immunosuppressants. Phagocytosis is a basic mechanism. The immune system's presence in unicellular organisms via enzymes. Sepsis is a medical condition linked to the immune system. 

Let me make sure each question is different. Avoid repeating similar ones. Also, ensure that the answers are correct and directly from the text. For example, the answer to the question about the founder is Ilya Ilyich Mechnikov. The answer to the purpose is to detect and neutralize pathogens. The answer to the components would be B cells, T cells, macrophages, etc. 

I need to generate exactly 10 pairs. Let me count as I go. First, the founder. Second, the purpose. Third, components. Fourth, adaptive vs innate. Fifth, phagocytosis. Sixth, autoimmune disease example. Seventh, immunodeficiency causes. Eighth, memory in adaptive immunity. Ninth, unicellular organisms. Tenth, sepsis as a condition.

Yes, that should cover 10 distinct aspects. Now, I need to phrase each question in Portuguese, making sure they are clear and directly answerable. Also, ensure that the answers are in Portuguese and match the context exactly. For example, "Imunidade adquirida é a base da vacinação" is a correct answer for the question about memory. 

I need to check that all answers are in the text. For example, "Sepsis" is mentioned as a medical condition related to the immune system. Also, "food allergy" is listed as a medical cause. So that's correct. 

I think that's all. Let me structure the JSON now, making sure each entry is in the correct format without any extra text or explanations.
