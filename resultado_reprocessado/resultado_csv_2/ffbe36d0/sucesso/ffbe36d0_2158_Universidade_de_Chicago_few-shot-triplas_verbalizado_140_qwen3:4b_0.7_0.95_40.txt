Okay, I need to generate 10 objective questions and answers based on the provided context and facts about the University of Chicago. Let me start by carefully reading through the context and the list of facts to ensure I cover different aspects.

First, the context mentions that the University of Chicago is a private research university in Chicago, Illinois. It has various divisions, schools, and a large student body. It's known for its academic programs and has a high concentration of Nobel laureates. The facts list a bunch of people associated with the university, both as alumni and faculty, along with some specific numbers like the student count and rankings.

I need to make sure the questions are varied and cover different areas: maybe some about the university's structure, student numbers, notable alumni, research contributions, and specific facts from the list. Also, the answers must be directly from the given information.

Let me check the examples they provided. They included questions about the type of university, founding year (though the context doesn't mention the year, but the example says 1890, which might be from the context), number of schools, divisions, student numbers, academic contributions, the Chicago Pile-1, the press, and the Obama Center's completion date. However, the user's context doesn't mention the founding year, so I need to be careful not to include that if it's not in the facts. Wait, the user's context says "Com uma data de conclusão estimada em 2021, o Centro Presidencial Barack Obama será abrigado na universidade..." which is about the Obama Center, not the founding date. So maybe the example's "when was it founded" is not in the actual context. But the user's context doesn't mention the founding year, so perhaps that's an error in the example. But since the user provided that example, maybe I should avoid that unless the context has it. Wait, the user's context says "A universidade atualmente registra 5 971 alunos de graduação e 16 016 alunos no total." So the total is 16,016, but the facts say "University of Chicago possui número de estudantes 18452" which is different. Wait, there's a discrepancy here. The context says 16,016, but the facts say 18,452. Hmm, maybe the facts are more recent data. So the answer should be based on the facts provided, which state 18,452 students. So in the example, the answer "5.000" was incorrect, but in the facts, the correct number is 18,452. So I need to make sure to use the facts given.

So the first question could be about the university's type, which is a research university. Then, the number of students, which is 18,452. Then, the number of schools, which is seven. The number of academic divisions is five. The research contributions, like in physics. The Obama Center's completion date is 2021. The Press is the University of Chicago Press. The Nobel laureates, but the facts say 98 Nobel laureates affiliated. Then, the ranking, which is USNWR 15. Also, the fact that the university has a wiki template. And the fact that the university has a specific image. Also, the fact that some people have alma mater or are affiliated with the university.

Wait, the user's facts list many people, but the questions should be about the university itself, not individuals. So maybe focus on the structure, student numbers, research, rankings, the Obama Center, the press, the number of schools, etc. Also, the example had a question about the number of schools, which is seven. The context says "sete escolas profissionais". So that's correct.

So I need to make 10 questions. Let me list possible questions:

1. What is the type of the University of Chicago?
2. How many students does the University of Chicago have?
3. How many professional schools does the University of Chicago have?
4. How many academic divisions does the University of Chicago have?
5. What is the name of the largest university press in the US?
6. What is the ranking of the University of Chicago (USNWR)?
7. Where is the Obama Center located?
8. What is the name of the image representing the University of Chicago?
9. What is the estimated completion year of the Obama Center?
10. What is the total number of students at the University of Chicago?

Wait, but the example already had some of these. Let me check the facts again. The facts mention "University of Chicago possui número de estudantes 18452" so the total is 18,452. The context says "16 016 alunos no total", but the fact is 18,452. So the answer should be 18,452. Also, the example's answer for the number of students was 5,000, which is incorrect, but the facts say 18,452. So the correct answer is 18, followed by 452.

Then, the Obama Center is estimated to be completed in 2021. The image is "University of Chicago wordmark.svg". The Press is "University of Chicago Press," and the ranking is USNWR 15. The number of schools is seven, divisions five. The type is a research university.

So the 10 questions would be:

1. What is the type of the University of Chicago?
2. How many students does the University of Chicago have?
3. How many professional schools does the University of Chicago have?
4. How many academic divisions does the University of Chicago have?
5. What is the name of the largest university press in the US?
6. What is the ranking of the University of Chicago (USNWR)?
7. Where is the Obama Center located?
8. What is the name of the image representing the University of Chicago?
9. What is the estimated completion year of the Obama Center?
10. What is the total number of students at the University of Chicago?

Wait, but the 10th question is the same as the second. So maybe adjust. Maybe include the fact that the university has a wiki template, or that the Obama Center is in Chicago. Also, the example had a question about the number of divisions, which is five. Also, the fact that the university has a specific image. So I need to make sure the questions are distinct.

Alternatively, maybe:

1. What is the type of the University of Chicago?
2. How many students does the University of Chicago have?
3. How many professional schools does the University of Chicago have?
4. How many academic divisions does the University of Chicago have?
5. What is the name of the largest university press in the US?
6. What is the ranking of the University of Chicago (USNWR)?
7. What is the name of the image representing the University of Chicago?
8. What is the estimated completion year of the Obama Center?
9. What is the name of the Obama Center?
10. What is the name of the department that helped develop the first nuclear reaction?

But the Obama Center's name is "Centro Presidencial Barack Obama," but the answer in the example was "Centro Presidencial Barack Obama" and the completion date is 2021. Also, the department that helped develop the first nuclear reaction is the physics department, as per the context: "departamento de física de Chicago".

So the questions can be:

1. What is the type of the University of Chicago?
2. How many students does the University of Chicago have?
3. How many professional schools does the University of Chicago have?
4. How many academic divisions does the University of Chicago have?
5. What is the name of the largest university press in the US?
6. What is the ranking of the University of Chicago (USNWR)?
7. What is the name of the image representing the University of Chicago?
8. What is the estimated completion year of the Obama Center?
9. What is the name of the department that helped develop the first nuclear reaction?
10. What is the name of the Obama Center?

But the user's example had a question about the number of divisions, which is five, and the example's answer for that was "quatro" which was incorrect. Wait, the context says "quatro divisões de pesquisa acadêmica" (four academic divisions), but the example had "quatro" as the answer. Wait, in the context, it says "a Universidade de Chicago possui cinco divisões de pesquisa acadêmica" (five divisions)? Wait, the context says "a Universidade de Chicago possui cinco divisões de pesquisa acadêmica" in the original text? Wait, let me check again.

Looking back at the user's context: "A Universidade de Chicago possui cinco divisões de pesquisa acadêmica." Yes, that's in the original context. So the answer for the number of academic divisions is five. So the example had that as "quatro", but that was incorrect. So in the correct answer, the number of divisions is five.

So the questions and answers need to be accurate based on the given facts.

So, compiling the 10 questions and answers, making sure they are all distinct and based on the facts provided.
