Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs based on the provided RDF data about the University of Chicago. Let me start by understanding the data.

Looking at the RDF snippet, it's structured with various triples. The subject is the University of Chicago, and predicates include its type as an abstraction, being an Agent, number of students, ranking, and some templates used in Wikipedia. There are also FOAF relations pointing to a depiction image.

I need to form questions that can be answered by this data. Each question should have a corresponding answer derived from the RDF.

1. **Number of Students**: The data has "numberOfStudents" as 18452 and "students" as 18452, so both can be used.
2. **Ranking**: The usnwrW predicate is set to "15", which likely stands for the 15th position in a ranking.
3. **Type of Institution**: It's an Agent and an Abstraction, but perhaps more meaningful would be the fact that it's a university.
4. **Depiction Image**: There's a FOAF depiction pointing to the wordmark SVG image on Wikimedia Commons.
5. **Templates Used**: The wikiPageUsesTemplate includes "Main_list" and the University of Chicago template.

Let me think about other possible attributes. Since the data is limited, I might need to make some inferences or standard questions people would ask about a university.

6. **Founding Year**: Not provided here, but it's a common question.
7. **Location**: The city and state of the university are not mentioned in this snippet, so that's another possible question.
8. **Motto**: Again, not present, but many universities have mottos.
9. **Notable Alumni**: Specific individuals aren't listed, but it's a common query.
10. **Campus Size**: Not given either.

I'll proceed to formulate the questions based on the available data, and for the ones that aren't directly answered here, I'll note that information isn't provided in the snippet.
