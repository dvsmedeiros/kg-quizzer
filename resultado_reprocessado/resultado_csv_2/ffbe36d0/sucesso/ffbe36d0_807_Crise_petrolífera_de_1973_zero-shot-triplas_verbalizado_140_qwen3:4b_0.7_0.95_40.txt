Okay, the user wants me to generate 10 objective questions and answers based on the provided context about the 1973 oil crisis. Let me start by carefully reading through the given context and facts to ensure I understand all the key points.

First, the context mentions that the oil crisis began in October 1973 when Arab oil-exporting countries imposed an embargo on nations supporting Israel during the Yom Kippur War. The countries affected initially were Canada, Japan, the Netherlands, the UK, and the US, later expanding to Portugal, Rhodesia, and South Africa. The oil price increased from $3 to $12 per barrel, with even higher prices in the US. This led to the "first oil shock," followed by the 1979 crisis.

Now, looking at the facts provided, there are various categories and tags associated with the 1973 oil crisis, such as economic disasters, embargoes, trade barriers, etc. However, the user instructed to base the questions solely on the context and facts provided, not on external knowledge. So I need to focus on the information given in the context and the list of facts.

The challenge is to create 10 distinct questions that cover different aspects. Let me list out the key elements from the context:

1. Start date of the crisis: October 1973.
2. Cause: Arab countries imposing embargo on nations supporting Israel.
3. Target countries: Initial list and later expansion.
4. Price increase: from $3 to $12 per barrel, with US prices higher.
5. Consequence: "first oil shock," leading to economic and political effects.
6. Categories and tags: economic disasters, embargoes, etc., but since the user wants questions based on the context, maybe not all of these, but the ones mentioned in the context.

Wait, the facts include things like "1973 oil crisis is of type YagoPermanentlyLocatedEntity" but I need to make sure the questions are based on the context given, not on the internal tags. The user said to generate questions and answers based on the context and facts provided, so perhaps the facts are just additional info but the main context is the text provided.

Wait, the user's instruction says: "Gere pares de perguntas e respostas relevantes e corretas, exclusivamente a partir do conteúdo fornecido." So the content is the context and the facts listed. But the facts are a list of attributes, types, categories, etc., which might be part of the content. However, the user might not want to use those tags as the basis for questions, but rather the actual events and facts mentioned in the context.

Wait, the context is the main text. The facts are a list of metadata, but the user says to generate questions based on the context and facts. However, the user's context is the first paragraph, and then the facts are a list of attributes. So perhaps the questions can be based on both the events described in the context and the attributes listed in the facts. But the user's example in the context is the main text, so maybe the facts are more about the categories and types, but the user might want questions based on the actual events.

Wait, the user's instruction says to generate questions based on the context and facts provided. The context is the first paragraph, and the facts are a list of attributes, types, categories, etc. But the user's example in the initial message is that the context is the first paragraph, and the facts are the list of tags and categories. However, the user's instruction says that the questions must be based on the content provided, which includes both the context and the facts. But maybe the facts are just additional info that can be used for questions, but the main content is the first paragraph.

Wait, the user says: "Gere pares de perguntas e respostas relevantes e corretas, exclusivamente a partir do conteúdo fornecido." The content provided is the context and the facts. So the questions can be about the events described in the context, and also about the facts listed. But the user's example in the context is the main text, and the facts are the list of attributes, types, etc.

But the user's instruction says that the questions should be based on the facts provided. However, in the initial message, the user provided a context (the paragraph about the 1973 oil crisis) and then a list of facts (tags, categories, etc.). So the user wants the questions to be based on both the context and the facts. However, the user's example in the instruction might be that the questions are about the events in the context, and the facts are additional data that can be used for questions.

But I need to be careful. The user says that the answers must be inferred or explicit from the content. So, for example, if the context says the embargo was directed at countries supporting Israel, then a question could be about which countries were targeted. Similarly, the facts include things like "1973 oil crisis is of type YagoPermanentlyLocatedEntity", but that might not be relevant. However, the user's instruction says that the facts are part of the content, so maybe the questions can be about the types or categories, but that might not be covered in the context.

Wait, the user's context is the first paragraph, and the facts are a list of tags and categories. The user might want the questions to be based on the context, and the facts are just additional metadata that the user included, but the actual content is the first paragraph. So maybe the questions should be based on the first paragraph. However, the user's instruction says "exclusivamente a partir do conteúdo fornecido", which includes both the context and the facts. But the facts are not part of the main text, they are metadata.

This is a bit confusing. Let me check the initial instruction again. The user says: "Gere pares de perguntas e respostas relevantes e corretas, exclusivamente a partir do conteúdo fornecido." The content provided is the context and the facts. So, the facts are part of the content. For example, the fact that the crisis is of type "WikicatEmbargoes" might be a category, but that's not part of the main text. However, the user's instruction says to generate questions based on the content, so maybe the questions can be about the types or categories, but that might be a stretch.

Alternatively, the user might have intended that the context is the main text, and the facts are additional information that can be used. However, the user's instruction says "exclusivamente a partir do conteúdo fornecido", which includes the context and the facts. So, the questions can be about both the events in the context and the facts listed.

But the user's example in the context is the main text, and the facts are the tags. However, the user might not want the questions to be about the tags but rather the events. For example, the first paragraph mentions the embargo, the countries involved, the price increase, etc. So the questions can be about those. However, the facts list includes things like "1973 oil crisis is of type YagoPermanentlyLocatedEntity", but that's not part of the main text. However, the user's instruction says to generate questions based on the content provided, so perhaps the facts are part of the content.

This is a bit unclear. However, the user's example in the context is the main text, and the facts are a list of metadata. So maybe the questions should be based on the main text, but the user might have included the facts as part of the content. Therefore, I need to create questions based on both the context and the facts.

But the user's instruction says to generate questions and answers based on the content provided, which includes both the context and the facts. Therefore, the questions can be about the events in the context and the attributes listed in the facts. However, the facts are not part of the main text, but they are part of the content provided.

Wait, the user says: "O conteúdo fornecido" includes both the context and the facts. So, for example, the fact that the crisis is of type "Crisis113933560" could be a question. However, that might not be relevant. Alternatively, the user might have intended that the facts are part of the content, but they are not part of the main text.

Alternatively, perhaps the facts are not part of the content but are just additional information that the user included. However, the user's instruction says to generate questions based on the content provided, which includes the facts. Therefore, the questions can be about the facts.

But this is a bit ambiguous. To proceed, I'll focus on the main text of the context, as that is the primary source of information. The facts are a list of metadata, but the user might not want questions based on those. Therefore, the questions will be based on the first paragraph of the context.

So, the main points are:

- The oil crisis started in October 1973.
- The reason was an embargo by Arab countries on nations supporting Israel.
- The initial countries targeted were Canada, Japan, Netherlands, UK, and US.
- Later expansion to Portugal, Rhodesia, and South Africa.
- Oil prices increased from $3 to $12 per barrel, with higher prices in the US.
- Resulted in the "first oil shock," leading to economic and political effects.

From this, I can create questions about the start date, the cause, the countries involved, the price increase, and the consequence.

Now, I need to generate 10 questions, each covering different aspects. Let's start:

1. When did the 1973 oil crisis begin?
   - October 1973.

2. What was the reason for the embargo imposed by Arab countries?
   - Supporting Israel during the Yom Kippur War.

3. Which countries were initially targeted by the embargo?
   - Canada, Japan, Netherlands, the UK, and the US.

4. What was the initial price of oil before the crisis?
   - $3 per barrel.

5. What was the price of oil after the crisis?
   - $12 per barrel.

6. Which countries were added to the embargo list later?
   - Portugal, Rhodesia, and South Africa.

7. What was the consequence of the oil price increase?
   - The "first oil shock," leading to economic and political effects.

8. What was the name of the event that led to the embargo?
   - The Yom Kippur War.

9. Which country had the highest oil prices during the crisis?
   - The US.

10. What was the main economic impact of the crisis?
    - The "first oil shock," causing significant economic and political effects.

But wait, the user's facts include "1973 oil crisis is of type Crisis113933560", but that's not part of the main text. However, the user might not want questions based on that. The user's instruction says to generate questions based on the content provided, which is the main text and the facts. However, the facts are not part of the main text, but they are part of the content. So perhaps the user wants questions about the facts as well. However, the facts are in a list, and they are not part of the main text. For example, "1973 oil crisis is of type YagoPermanentlyLocatedEntity" is a fact, but that's not part of the main text. Therefore, the user might not want questions based on that, but the user's instruction says to use the content provided, which includes the facts. However, since those facts are not part of the main text, but are part of the content, perhaps the user wants questions about the facts as well.

But this is unclear. The user's main text is the first paragraph, and the facts are a list of metadata. Therefore, the questions should be based on the main text. The user might have included the facts as part of the content, but they are not part of the main text. Therefore, the correct approach is to generate questions based on the main text.

So the 10 questions I listed above are based on the main text. However, I need to check if the user wants 10 questions, but in the example, the user's context is the main text, and the facts are additional data. Therefore, the 10 questions are based on the main text.
