Okay, so I need to generate exactly 10 pairs of questions and answers based on the context provided. Each question should be relevant and have a unique correct answer. The context is about the Black Death pandemic, specifically European aspects like its spread, causes, and impact.

First, I'll look at the given context. It mentions when the plague originated in Europe (around 1340s), the data on its spread, size of population affected, recovery time, causes such as fleas, historical records, and so on.

Now, I need to create questions that are directly related to these points but phrased in a way that's clear and specific. For example, instead of asking "When did the plague originate?" I'll ask about specific locations or effects.

I'll make sure each question is unique and covers different aspects without repeating previous examples. Let me list out possible questions and then assign them to answers based on their content:

1. Where does the Black Death originate in Europe?  
   This relates to the European spread of the plague, using the data from the context that 30-60% of the population was affected.

2. How much population was affected by the plague in Europe?  
   Using data from the context about 75 million deaths globally and roughly half being European, which would be around 37-48 million.

3. When did the Black Death originate in Europe?  
   The context mentions spread from 1346 onwards, so this is accurate and specific.

4. What are the main causes of the plague?  
   Using information about fleas feeding on blood to transmit the infection.

5. Who were the scientists credited with discovering the plague?  
   It's stated that Ole Jørgen Benedictow atua nas áreas Black Death, so mentioning the scientists is appropriate.

6. What does it mean for a population to be encroached by a disease?  
   Using the context about 75% recovery in the 17th century, which implies successful control.

7. How long did the plague last on a European scale?  
   The context says it took until the 17th century, so this is a good question.

8. When did the Black Death actually start in Europe and continue to the mid-16th century?  
   This ties back to when the plague began and how long it lasted.

9. How many European deaths were caused by the plague?  
   Using the data about around 37 million deaths globally and 75% being European, which would be approximately 28 million.

10. Who was responsible for documenting the plague's spread and effects?  
    This ties into the methods of research, mentioning that Black Death had numerous records and images.

Now, I'll structure each pair with a clear question and the corresponding answer based on the context provided.
