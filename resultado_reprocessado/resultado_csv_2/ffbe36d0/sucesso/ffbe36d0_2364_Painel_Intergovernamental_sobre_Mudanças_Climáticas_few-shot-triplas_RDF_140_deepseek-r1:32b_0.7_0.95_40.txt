Okay, I need to create 10 question and answer pairs based on the given context about the IPCC. Let me start by reading through the provided information carefully.

First, the context explains that the IPCC was created in 1988 under the United Nations (UN) by the UN Environment Programme (PNUMA) and the World Meteorological Organization (OMM). Its main goal is to synthesize and spread knowledge about climate change, specifically global warming. It doesn't do original research but compiles existing studies from top scientists. The IPCC has produced five major reports since 1990, with the last one in 2014. They won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2007.

Looking at the facts section, there are several people associated with the IPCC, like Bert Bolin and Rajendra Pachauri. Also, it's mentioned that the IPCC is based in Geneva, Switzerland, led by Hoesung Lee as Chair. Their parent organizations are the UN Environment Programme and the World Meteorological Organization.

Now, I should generate varied questions covering different aspects of this information without repeating similar ones. Each question must have a single correct answer from the context or facts provided.

Let me brainstorm some key points to cover:
1. Creation year and creators
2. Headquarters location
3. Objective
4. Nature of research (not producing original)
5. Number of major reports
6. Nobel Prize win year
7. Lead authors mentioned
8. Types of documents produced besides reports
9. Parent organizations
10. Nationality of a notable member

I need to phrase these into clear questions with precise answers.

Wait, the examples provided include questions about ONU and specific people like Hoesung Lee, so I should make sure not to repeat those exact ones but cover similar aspects differently.

Let me structure each question based on these points:

1. When was the IPCC created?
2. Where is its headquarters?
3. What is their main objective?
4. Do they conduct original research? (Answer: No)
5. How many major reports have they produced?
6. In which year did they win the Nobel Peace Prize?
7. Who are some key figures involved in the IPCC's work?
8. Besides reports, what other documents do they produce?
9. Which UN agencies established them?
10. What is the nationality of a prominent figure like Hoesung Lee?

I think these cover all necessary aspects without overlapping too much with the examples given.
