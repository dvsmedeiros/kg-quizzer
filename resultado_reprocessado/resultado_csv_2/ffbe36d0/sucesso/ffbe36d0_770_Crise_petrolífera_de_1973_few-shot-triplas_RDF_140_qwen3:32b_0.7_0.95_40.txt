Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to generate 10 question-answer pairs in Portuguese based on the provided context about the 1973 oil crisis. The context is pretty detailed, so I need to make sure each question is unique and covers different aspects.

First, I'll start by identifying key points in the context. The main facts include the start date (October 1973), the organization involved (OPAEP), the countries targeted (Canada, Japan, Netherlands, UK, US, etc.), the price increase (from $3 to $12 per barrel), the end of the embargo in March 1974, and the "first oil shock" terminology. Also, the second oil crisis in 1979 is mentioned.

I need to create varied questions. Let me brainstorm possible angles. Maybe start with the organization responsible, the initial countries targeted, the price before and after, the duration of the embargo, the term "first oil shock," the second crisis year, the effects (economic and political), and maybe the reason behind the embargo. Also, check if there's any specific data from the facts section, like dates or numbers.

Wait, the user provided examples. Let me check them to avoid repetition. The examples include questions about start date, price in 1974, second crisis, another term for the crisis, who proclaimed the embargo, and others. So I need to make sure my questions are different. For example, not asking about the price in 1974 again, but maybe the price before the embargo. Also, the countries targeted beyond the initial ones, like Portugal, Rhodesia, South Africa.

I need to ensure each question has a clear, single correct answer from the context. Let's list possible questions:

1. Which organization announced the oil embargo? (OPAEP)
2. What were the initial countries targeted? (Canada, Japan, Netherlands, UK, US)
3. What was the oil price before the embargo? ($3 per barrel)
4. What was the oil price in March 1974? ($12 globally)
5. When did the embargo end? (March 1974)
6. What is the other name for this crisis? (First oil shock)
7. Which crisis followed in 1979? (Second oil shock)
8. What were the long-term effects? (Economic and political impacts)
9. Why was the embargo imposed? (Support for Israel during Yom Kippur War)
10. How many countries were targeted besides the initial ones? (Portugal, Rhodesia, South Africa)

Check if these are all covered and don't repeat. The examples already covered some, like the first question's answer. Let me adjust to avoid duplication. For instance, the example asked "Quem proclamou o embargo" and I need a different question. Maybe "Qual a razão para o embargo?".

Also, ensure the answers are exact. For example, the countries beyond the initial are Portugal, Rhodesia, and South Africa. So the answer to question 10 would be those three. The price before the embargo was $3, and after $12. The embargo ended in March 1974.

I need to structure each question and answer correctly in Portuguese, ensuring they are clear and concise. Let's compile the list now, checking against the context and avoiding repetition with examples.
