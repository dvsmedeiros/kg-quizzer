Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs based on the given context and facts about the Black Death. Let me start by thoroughly understanding the provided information.

First, the context mentions that the Black Death was the most devastating pandemic, killing 75-200 million people in Eurasia between 1347-1351. The causative bacterium is Yersinia pestis, leading to different forms like bubonic, septicemic, and pneumonic. It originated in Central or East Asia, spread via the Silk Road to Crimea in 1343, then through rats on merchant ships to the Mediterranean and Europe. It killed 30-60% of Europe's population, reducing the global population from 475 million to 350-375 million. Europe took 200 years to recover, with some areas like Florence recovering only in the 19th century. The plague had significant religious, social, and economic impacts and recurred until the early 20th century.

The facts include various RDF data, like the DBpedia entries, mentioning academics like Ole Jørgen Benedictow and Sharon N. DeWitte, their interests in the Black Death, and other related categories. There are also specific details like the disease being Yersinia pestis, the spread routes, the death tolls, and sources like Geoffrey the Baker's chronicle.

Now, I need to create 10 unique questions, each with a correct answer based on this info. Let me brainstorm possible questions:

1. **Cause of the Black Death**: The context states Yersinia pestis. So the question could be "What is the bacterium responsible for the Black Death?" Answer: Yersinia pestis.

2. **Forms of the disease**: The context mentions bubonic, septicemic, and pneumonic. Question: "What are the three forms of the plague caused by Yersinia pestis?" Answer: Bubonic, septicemic, and pneumonic.

3. **Origin**: The Black Death originated in Central or East Asia. Question: "Where did the Black Death originate according to the context?" Answer: Asia Central or East Asia.

4. **Spread via Silk Road**: The context says it spread along the Silk Road to Crimea. Question: "How did the Black Death spread from Asia to Europe?" Answer: Through the Silk Road and rats on merchant ships.

5. **Death toll in Europe**: 30-60% of the population. Question: "What percentage of Europe's population died during the Black Death?" Answer: 30% to 60%.

6. **Global population reduction**: From 475 million to 350-375 million. Question: "How did the Black Death affect the global population?" Answer: Reduced it from 475 million to 350-375 million.

7. **Recovery time**: Europe took 200 years. Question: "How long did it take Europe to recover its population after the Black Death?" Answer: Approximately 200 years.

8. **Subsequent outbreaks**: The plague returned until the early 20th century. Question: "Until which century did the Black Death recur as outbreaks?" Answer: The early 20th century.

9. **Impact on society**: Religious, social, and economic convulsions. Question: "What social and economic effects did the Black Death have?" Answer: Religious, social, and economic convulsions.

10. **Key source**: Geoffrey the Baker's chronicle. Question: "Which historical source describes the spread of the Black Death in England?" Answer: Geoffrey the Baker's Chronicon Angliae.

Wait, I need to ensure each question is distinct and covers different aspects. Let me check for repetition. The first question is about the cause, second about forms, third origin, fourth spread, fifth death toll, sixth global impact, seventh recovery, eighth recurrence, ninth societal impact, tenth source. That seems varied. Now, I need to make sure the answers are directly from the context. For example, the spread via rats on ships is mentioned, so the answer should include that. Also, the recovery time is 200 years, and the recurrence until early 20th century. The societal impact is mentioned as religious, social, and economic. The source is Geoffrey the Baker. 

I think these are all covered. Now, I'll structure each pair clearly, ensuring the answers are concise and accurate based on the provided data.
