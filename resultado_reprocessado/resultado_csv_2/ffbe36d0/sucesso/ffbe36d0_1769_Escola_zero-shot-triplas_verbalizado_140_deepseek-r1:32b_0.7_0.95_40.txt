Okay, so I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs based on the given context and facts. The context talks about schools in general—how they've evolved from places for discussion or leisure to formal institutions with different levels of education like elementary and high school, and mentions universities as places for higher education.

Then there's a list of specific schools, all marked as private. So, I think the questions should cover both the general context about schools and some specifics about these listed institutions.

First, maybe I can ask about the modern meaning of "escola" since that's in the context. Then another question about what types of education are typically offered.

Looking at the facts, all the examples given are private schools, so perhaps a question about whether those specific institutions are public or private. But wait, the user wants each pair to have one correct answer, and they don't want similar questions repeated.

I should vary the aspects: some general, some specific. Maybe another question about the progression through school levels—elementary then high school.

Also, considering different countries since some schools are in places like Lahore or Kansas City. So maybe a question about whether these private schools are international or not.

Wait, but all the listed schools might be from various countries, so I can ask if they're spread internationally.

Another point is that universities are higher education institutions, so perhaps a question linking a university to its purpose.

I should also check if there's information on seminaries or theological schools in the list. Yes, there are some like Yaeil Theological Seminary and others. So maybe a question about whether these schools include religious education.

Also, looking at the structure, the context mentions that most countries have formal education systems with elementary and high school levels. So I can ask if these private institutions offer those levels.

I need to make sure each question is clear and relates directly to the content without being repetitive. Also, each should have a single correct answer.

Let me outline possible questions:

1. What does "escola" mean today?
2. Which types of education are usually offered by schools?
3. Are KGiSL Institute of Technology and others public or private?
4. How do students progress through school systems?
5. Do most countries have formal education systems?
6. Is Lahore School of Economics a higher education institution?
7. What is the purpose of a university like USC Davis?
8. Which countries have these private schools?
9. Are there religious institutions among the listed ones?
10. At what levels do these private schools operate?

Wait, but I need to phrase them as questions and ensure each has one correct answer.

Let me adjust:

1. What is the modern definition of "escola"? - Formal institution for teaching students.
2. Which educational stages are typically offered? - Elementary and high school.
3. Are the listed institutions public or private? - Private schools.
4. How do students advance in formal systems? - Through elementary to high school.
5. Is education generally mandatory? - Usually compulsory.
6. Is Lahore School a higher ed institution? - Yes, as a university.
7. What is USC Davis? - A private university for gerontology.
8. Are these schools international? - Spread across countries.
9. Do some offer religious education? - Yes, like Catholic or seminaries.
10. At what levels do they operate? - From elementary to higher education.

Wait, but in the context, it says that "faculdade" is where higher education is taught. So perhaps a question about whether a school is a university or not.

Also, I need to ensure each answer is directly from the content. For example, the context mentions that universities are for higher education, so one answer can be that a university is for higher studies.

I think I've covered various aspects: definitions, types of education, institution types (private), progression through levels, mandatory education, international presence, religious affiliation, and specific examples.

Now, to structure them as 10 pairs without repetition.
