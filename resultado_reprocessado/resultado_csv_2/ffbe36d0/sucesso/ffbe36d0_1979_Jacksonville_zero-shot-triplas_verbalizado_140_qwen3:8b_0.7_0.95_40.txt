Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to generate 10 question-answer pairs based on the provided context and facts about Jacksonville, Florida. The key points are to make sure each question is varied, covers different aspects, and has a unique correct answer. I need to avoid repeating similar questions.

First, I'll go through the context and facts again. The context mentions Jacksonville's population, location, history, and some landmarks. The facts include various events, people born or died there, sports teams, and other locations. 

I need to extract different aspects. For example, population stats, founding date, geographical location, historical events, notable people, sports teams, landmarks, and maybe some specific facts like precipitation or temperature. 

Let me list possible questions. 

1. What is Jacksonville's population according to the 2020 census?
   Answer: Nearly 950,000.

2. When was Jacksonville founded?
   Answer: 1791.

3. What is Jacksonville's nickname?
   Answer: "Jax", "The River City", "The Bold New City of the South".

4. Which river does Jacksonville lie on?
   Answer: St. Johns River.

5. Who was the first governor of Florida and after whom the city was named?
   Answer: Andrew Jackson.

6. What is the population density of Jacksonville?
   Answer: 490.63 per km².

7. What is the name of the stadium where the 2005 Super Bowl was held?
   Answer: EverBank Field.

8. Which notable landmark is located in Jacksonville?
   Answer: St. John's Cathedral.

9. Which sports team has its home in Jacksonville?
   Answer: Jacksonville Jaguars (though not listed, but maybe another team from the facts). Wait, the facts mention the Jacksonville Jaguars in the context, but in the provided facts, there's a mention of the 2005 Super Bowl at EverBank Field, which is the Jaguars' stadium. So maybe that's a good question.

Wait, the facts also mention the Jacksonville Jaguars in the context. Let me check the facts again. The context says "Jacksonville, Florida possui título de fundação Founded" and "2005 Super Bowl no EverBank Field". The facts also mention several sports teams like "2010 Houston Texans season possui estádio Jacksonville, Florida" and "2015 Fort Lauderdale Strikers season está localizado em Jacksonville, Florida". So maybe a question about which team is based there.

But the user might prefer questions that are more about the city itself rather than sports teams. Let me see. The user wants questions based on the context and facts provided. The context mentions the Super Bowl, so that's a good point. Also, the population rank, founding date, etc.

Another fact is about the temperature: "Jacksonville, Florida possui temperatura mínima em fevereiro (°F) 46.1". So a question about the minimum temperature in February.

Also, the facts mention some people born there, like Butch Trucks, Keith Johns, etc. So a question about someone born in Jacksonville.

Also, the fact that it's the third most populous city on the East Coast, after NYC and Philly. So a question about that.

Also, the location relative to Georgia and Miami.

So possible questions:

1. What is Jacksonville's population according to the 2020 census?
2. When was Jacksonville founded?
3. What is Jacksonville's nickname?
4. Which river does Jacksonville lie on?
5. Who was the first governor of Florida and after whom the city was named?
6. What is the population density of Jacksonville?
7. Where was the 2005 Super Bowl held?
8. What is the name of a notable landmark in Jacksonville?
9. What is the minimum temperature in Jacksonville in February?
10. Which notable person was born in Jacksonville?

Wait, need to check if all answers are present in the context. For example, the minimum temperature is given. The landmarks like St. John's Cathedral are mentioned. The Super Bowl location is EverBank Field. The nickname is given. The population is 950k. The founding year is 1791. The first governor is Andrew Jackson. The river is St. Johns. The population density is 490.63. 

Also, the facts mention that it's the 12th most populous city in the US, but the context says third on the East Coast. So that's a possible question. 

Wait, the context says "a terceira cidade mais populosa na costa leste dos Estados Unidos, depois de Nova Iorque e Filadélfia". So the third most populous on the East Coast. So a question about that. 

So maybe:

10. What is Jacksonville's ranking in the most populous cities in the United States?
   Answer: 12th.

But the user's context says "a 12ª mais populosa do país", which is 12th. So that's a valid question.

So compiling all these, I can create 10 distinct questions. Need to ensure they are not similar. Let me check for repetition. Each question should cover different aspects: population, founding, nickname, river, first governor, population density, Super Bowl location, landmark, temperature, and ranking.

Yes, that should work. Now, I need to make sure each answer is correct based on the context and facts provided. For example, the Super Bowl location is EverBank Field, which is mentioned in the context. The nickname is given in the facts. The temperature is in the facts. The population is from the context. The founding year is from the context. The river is mentioned in the context. The first governor is Andrew Jackson, as per the context. The population density is in the facts. The landmark is St. John's Cathedral. The ranking is 12th. The notable person born there could be any of the listed names, like Butch Trucks. 

Wait, the user's instruction says to use the facts provided. The context mentions "Jacksonville, Florida possui apelido "Jax", "The River City", The Bold New City of the South" so that's the nickname. 

So the 10 questions would be:

1. What is Jacksonville's population according to the 2020 census? Answer: Nearly 950,000.
2. When was Jacksonville founded? Answer: 1791.
3. What is Jacksonville's nickname? Answer: "Jax", "The River City", "The Bold New City of the South".
4. Which river does Jacksonville lie on? Answer: St. Johns River.
5. Who was the first governor of Florida and after whom the city was named? Answer: Andrew Jackson.
6. What is the population density of Jacksonville? Answer: 490.63 per km².
7. Where was the 2005 Super Bowl held? Answer: EverBank Field.
8. What is the name of a notable landmark in Jacksonville? Answer: St. John's Cathedral.
9. What is the minimum temperature in Jacksonville in February? Answer: 46.1°F.
10. What is Jacksonville's ranking in the most populous cities in the United States? Answer: 12th.

That's 10 distinct questions. Each answer is derived from the context and facts provided. I need to make sure that the answers are exactly as stated. For example, the population is "nearly 950,000" as per the context. The nickname includes all three names. The river is St. Johns. The first governor is Andrew Jackson. The population density is 490.63. The Super Bowl location is EverBank Field. The landmark is St. John's Cathedral. The temperature is 46.1°F. The ranking is 12th. 

Yes, that should cover all the required points without repetition and covers different aspects of Jacksonville.
