Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to generate 10 question-answer pairs based on the provided context and facts about the Yuan Dynasty. First, I need to make sure I understand the context and the facts correctly. The Yuan Dynasty was established by Kublai Khan in 1271, and there are a lot of facts listed, such as its capital, related events, models used in Wikipedia pages, and other historical figures and events connected to it.

I need to ensure that each question is unique and covers different aspects. Let's start by looking at the key points. The founding year is 1271, so that's a good first question. Then, the capital is mentioned as Shangdu and Khanbaliq, but I should check which one is correct. Wait, the facts say "Yuan dynasty tem como capital Shangdu" and "Yuan dynasty tem como capital Khanbaliq." Hmm, but according to historical knowledge, the capital was Dadu, which is modern-day Beijing. However, the user's data might have conflicting info. Wait, the facts say "Yuan dynasty tem como capital Shangdu" and also "Yuan dynasty tem como capital Khanbaliq." But Shangdu was the summer capital, while Dadu was the main capital. However, in the provided facts, there's a mention of "Yuan dynasty possui c 大都" which is Dadu. So maybe the main capital is Dadu. But the user's data might have inconsistencies. But I should go strictly by the facts provided, not my own knowledge.

Wait, the user's context says "Yuan dynasty tem como capital Shangdu" and later "Yuan dynasty tem como capital Khanbaliq." But the facts also mention "Yuan dynasty possui c 大都" which is Dadu. This is confusing. However, the user might have conflicting info in their facts. But I need to follow the facts as given. Let me check the facts again. Let me scan through the facts:

- Yuan dynasty tem como capital Shangdu
- Yuan dynasty tem como capital Khanbaliq
- Yuan dynasty possui c 大都

So, the user's data has Shangdu, Khanbaliq, and 大都 (Dadu) as capitals. But historically, Shangdu was the summer capital, and Dadu was the main capital. However, the user's facts might have errors. But since the user is providing that, I have to use it as is. So, perhaps the answer should be Shangdu and Khanbaliq? But the user might want the correct historical answer. However, the instructions say to use the context and facts provided. So if the facts say Shangdu is the capital, then that's the answer. But the user also mentions "Yuan dynasty possui c 大都" which is Dadu. So maybe the user has conflicting data. But since the user's instruction is to use the provided facts, I'll have to go with that. However, the initial context says "Yuan dynasty tem como capital Shangdu," so that's one fact. So a question could be "Qual foi a capital da Dinastia Yuan?" with answer "Shangdu."

But then there's also Khanbaliq mentioned. Wait, Khanbaliq is another name for Dadu. So perhaps the user's data is conflicting. But I need to follow the facts as given. Let's move on.

Another point is the founder: Kublai Khan, so a question about the founder. Then, the dynasty's name in Chinese is 元朝 (Yuán cháo), so a question about the Chinese name. Also, the dynasty's end date is 1368-09-14, so a question about when it ended. There's also the Battle of Yamen being related to the Yuan Dynasty, and the currency used was Cash (Chinese coin). The models used in Wikipedia pages are various, like Template:Commons category-inline, Template:Main, etc. Also, events like the Red Turban Rebellions and the Mongol conquest of the Song dynasty are related. There are religious aspects mentioned, like Buddhism, Tengrism, etc. The dynasty is classified under certain types like Country108544813, and has related categories like Category:Mongol states. Also, there's a map image, Yuan Provinces.png, and some images like Qubilai Setsen Khaan.jpg and Yuan Underglaze Blue Jingdezhen Porcelain.jpg.

I need to pick 10 different aspects. Let's list possible questions:

1. Founder: Kublai Khan.
2. Start year: 1271.
3. End year: 1368-09-14.
4. Capital: Shangdu (but also Khanbaliq and Dadu? Need to check which is correct in the user's data).
5. Chinese name: 元朝 (Yuán cháo).
6. Religion: Buddhism, Mongolian Tengrism, etc.
7. Related event: Battle of Yamen.
8. Currency: Cash (Chinese coin).
9. Models used in Wikipedia: Template:Main, Template:Infobox former country, etc.
10. Related rebellion: Red Turban Rebellions.

Wait, but the user's facts mention "Red Turban Rebellions está localizado em Yuan dynasty" so that's a possible question. Also, the dynasty's type is Country108544813. Also, the dynasty's equivalent ID is 3875150325579210090000. But maybe that's too obscure. The user might not want that. So better to focus on more straightforward facts.

So compiling the questions:

1. Quem fundou a Dinastia Yuan?
   Resposta: Kublai Khan.

2. Em que ano a Dinastia Yuan foi oficialmente estabelecida?
   Resposta: 1271.

3. Qual foi a data da dissolução da Dinastia Yuan?
   Resposta: 1368-09-14.

4. Qual é o nome chinês da Dinastia Yuan?
   Resposta: 元朝 (Yuán cháo).

5. Qual foi a moeda utilizada durante a Dinastia Yuan?
   Resposta: Cash (Chinese coin).

6. Qual evento histórico está associado à Dinastia Yuan?
   Resposta: Battle of Yamen.

7. Quais são alguns dos modelos de página wiki utilizados para a Dinastia Yuan?
   Resposta: Template:Main, Template:Infobox former country, Template:Reflist, entre outros.

8. Quais revoluções estão associadas à Dinastia Yuan?
   Resposta: Red Turban Rebellions.

9. Qual foi a capital da Dinastia Yuan segundo as informações fornecidas?
   Resposta: Shangdu.

10. Quais religiões eram praticadas durante a Dinastia Yuan?
    Resposta: Budismo, Tengrismo mongol, Xamanismo, Taoísmo, Confucionismo, religião folclórica chinesa, cristianismo nestoriano chinês, cristianismo católico romano, judaísmo, maniqueísmo chinês e islamismo.

But need to check the facts for accuracy. For example, the user's facts say "Yuan dynasty possui assunto Category:Mongol states" and "Yuan dynasty é classificado como Country108544813", but maybe that's not necessary. Also, the user mentions the dynasty's end year as 1368, but the exact date is 1368-09-14. Also, the capital is mentioned as Shangdu, but there's also Khanbaliq and Dadu. However, the user's facts have conflicting capitals. But since the user's data says "Yuan dynasty tem como capital Shangdu", that's the answer to use. The other capitals might be part of the models or other data but not the main capital. So proceeding with that.
