Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs based on the given context and facts about Fresno. Let me start by reviewing the context and facts carefully.

First, the context says Fresno is the fifth most populous city in California, located in Fresno County, incorporated in 1885, with a population of over 542,000 as of 2020. The facts list various things like people born or died there, area codes, government type, coordinates, sports teams, etc.

I need to make sure each question is unique and covers different aspects. Let me brainstorm possible questions.

1. **Population**: The context mentions it's the 34th most populous city in the US. So a question could be about its rank in the US.
2. **Incorporation Year**: The context states it was incorporated in 1885. That's straightforward.
3. **Area Code**: The facts mention the area code is 559. So a question about that.
4. **Government Type**: The fact says it's a Strong Mayor type. So a question on that.
5. **Coordinates**: The coordinates are given as 36.75 -119.76666666666667. A question about that.
6. **Population in 2020**: The context says over 542,000. So a question on that number.
7. **Largest City in California**: The context says it's the fifth. So a question about that.
8. **Total Area**: The fact states 300.438620798976. A question on that.
9. **Founder or Establishment Year**: The context mentions founded in 1872. So a question on that.
10. **Type of Government**: Already covered, maybe another angle? Wait, the facts also mention "tipo de governo Strong Mayor" and "tipo de assentamento List of municipalities in California". Maybe a question about the settlement type.

Wait, need to check if these are all from the context. The context mentions "tipo de governo Strong Mayor" in the facts. So that's valid. Also, the coordinates are in the facts. The area code is there. The total area is in the facts. The population in 2020 is in the context. The incorporation year is in the context. The fifth largest in California is in the context. The founder year is 1872. The coordinates are in the facts. The total area is in the facts. The government type is in the facts. The settlement type is in the facts.

So I can make 10 questions based on these points. Let me structure them:

1. What is the population rank of Fresno in the United States?
   - Answer: 34th

2. In which year was Fresno incorporated?
   - Answer: 1885

3. What is the area code for Fresno, California?
   - Answer: 559

4. What type of government does Fresno have?
   - Answer: Strong Mayor

5. What are the geographic coordinates of Fresno, California?
   - Answer: 36.75 -119.76666666666667

6. What was the population of Fresno according to the 2020 census?
   - Answer: Over 542,000

7. What is the fifth largest city in California?
   - Answer: Fresno

8. What is the total area of Fresno, California?
   - Answer: 300.438620798976

9. In which year was Fresno founded?
   - Answer: 1872

10. What type of settlement is Fresno classified as?
   - Answer: List of municipalities in California

Wait, but the context says "tipo de assentamento List of municipalities in California" in the facts. So that's the answer. But I need to make sure the question is phrased correctly. Maybe "What is the type of settlement classification for Fresno, California?" or similar.

I need to check that all answers are directly from the context or facts. The answers should be exact as per the given data. Let me verify each one:

- The 34th rank is in the context.
- Incorporated in 1885: context.
- Area code 559: fact.
- Government type: fact.
- Coordinates: fact.
- Population 542k: context.
- Fifth largest in CA: context.
- Total area: fact.
- Founded 1872: context.
- Settlement type: fact.

Yes, all are covered. Now, structure the JSON accordingly, ensuring no markdown and correct formatting.
