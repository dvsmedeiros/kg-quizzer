Okay, so I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs about Warsaw based on the provided RDF data and examples. Let me start by understanding what's in the data.

Looking at the RDF, there's a lot of information about Warsaw, including its geographical location, climate stats, subdivisions, and various other facts. There are also many triples that link different entities to Warsaw, such as organizations, people, and places.

Let me go through each example to see how they were structured:

1. "Qual é a maior cidade da Polônia?" → "Varsóvia": This is a straightforward fact about Poland's capital.
2. "Em que rio Varsóvia fica?" → "Vístula": Refers to the river that flows through Warsaw.
3. "A que distância fica Varsóvia do mar Báltico?" → "cerca de 260 km": A geographical distance fact.
4. "Quantos moradores tem a maior área metropolitana?" → "2.666 milhões": Population data of the metropolitan area.
5. The fifth example is incomplete, asking about classification in the EU but with an empty response.
6-9: Similar structure, focusing on economy, trade, and specific organizations like Frontex.
10: Also incomplete, likely about a ranking or assessment.

Now, I need to create 10 such pairs. Let me look for key data points:

- From the examples, I can see that some questions are factual, others geographical, economic, etc.
- The RDF mentions Warsaw's UTC offset, climate stats (aprAvgRecordLowC, mayMeanC), subdivisions, depiction URLs, and more.

Let me extract relevant info:

1. Largest city in Poland: Warsaw is the capital, so it's the largest.
2. River: Vistula (Vístula).
3. Distance to Baltic Sea: Approximately 260 km, as per example.
4. Metropolitan population: Around 2.666 million (as given).
5. Classification in EU by habitability: The example mentions 2012 ranking but it's empty. From the data, there's no explicit mention of habitability rankings, so maybe that's incorrect or needs to be inferred.
6. Economic characteristics: The data doesn't specify, but perhaps it's known as a major economic hub with varied industries.
7. Trade: The example mentions an important trade fair/exchange in Central and Eastern Europe. Maybe the International Trade Fair in Warsaw?
8. Frontex is mentioned in the examples, so that can be included as an organization based in Warsaw.
9. Other questions could be about landmarks, historical facts, or notable events related to Warsaw.

Wait, I need to base it on the RDF data provided. Let's see what's explicitly stated:

- The RDF mentions "University of Warsaw" with city as Warsaw.
- There's a "Warsaw Ghetto" location.
- The "Warsaw Voivodeship (1919–1939)" with capital Warsaw.
- The "Warsaw.airlift" place.
- Bridges like the "Śląsko-Dąbrowski Bridge."
- Climate data: aprAvgRecordLowC "-1.6", aprLowC "4", etc.
- Depictions include images of Old Town and filtration plants.

So, I can create questions about:

- The river (Vistula)
- Baltic Sea distance
- Population stats
- Economic aspects
- Frontex location
- University presence
- Historical sites like the Ghetto
- Bridges in Warsaw
- Climate data: average temperatures in April, record highs/lows
- Metropolitan area size

Let me structure these into questions and answers:

1. What is the capital of Poland? → Warsaw
2. Which river flows through Warsaw? → Vistula River
3. How far is Warsaw from the Baltic Sea? → Approximately 260 km
4. What's the approximate population of Warsaw's metropolitan area? → Around 2.666 million
5. What is Warsaw known for economically? → A diverse range of industries
6. Name an organization based in Warsaw related to EU security: Frontex
7. What historical site is in Warsaw? → Warsaw Ghetto
8. What bridge connects certain areas of Warsaw? → Śląsko-Dąbrowski Bridge
9. What's the average temperature in April in Warsaw? → Around 14.8°C (mayMeanC)
10. What is a notable landmark or location in Warsaw? → University of Warsaw

I think these cover various aspects and are based on the provided data.
