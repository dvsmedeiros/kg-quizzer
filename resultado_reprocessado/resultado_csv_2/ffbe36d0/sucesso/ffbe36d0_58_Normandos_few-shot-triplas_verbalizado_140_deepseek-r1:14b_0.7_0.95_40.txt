Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs based on the given context and facts about the Normans. The questions should be varied, covering different aspects of their history, culture, and locations.

First, I'll read through the context provided. It mentions that Normans were a Germanic people in northern France, with aristocracy descending from Viking stock. They had significant roles in medieval Europe, including colonizing Normandy, conquering England, establishing states in Sicily and southern Italy, and participating in the Crusades.

Looking at the facts section, I see details about their language (Old Norse), religions (Norse paganism and Christianity), locations like Normandy, castles they occupied, battles they fought, and notable figures.

I need to make sure each question is unique and touches on different areas. Let me start by identifying key points:

1. Origin: They're Germanic, from Scandinavia.
2. Language: Old Norse or Latin.
3. Religion: Initially paganism, later Christianity.
4. Notable places: Normandy, castles like Kells Castle.
5. Battles: Siege of Mahdia, Battle of Montepeloso, etc.
6. Influences: On architecture (St Bride's Church), people with Norman ethnicity.

Now, I'll create questions around these points.

1. What language did the Normans primarily speak? From facts, it mentions Old Norse and Latin.
2. Which religion did the Normans follow? Both paganism and Christianity are mentioned.
3. Where were the Normans originally from? The context says they were Germanic, from Scandinavia.
4. Name a castle occupied by Normans. Facts list several like Kells Castle.
5. What was a significant structure built by Normans? Castles or motte-and-bailey castles come to mind.
6. Who led the Normans in a famous battle? William the Conqueror is notable.
7. Which region were the Normans associated with in France? Normandy.
8. Name one of their architectural styles. Norman architecture, like churches mentioned.
9. What was an important part of Norman culture besides religion and language? Maybe their military practices or governance.
10. Which battles involved Normans? Battles listed include Siege of Mahdia and others.

Wait, some questions might overlap if I'm not careful. Let me ensure each is unique:

- For question 7, maybe ask where they were established in France instead of just the region.
- For question 9, perhaps focus on their expansion or conquests.

I'll structure them to cover origins, language, religion, architecture, battles, key figures, regions, castles, and their influence on other areas like law or governance. This way, each question addresses a different aspect without repetition.
