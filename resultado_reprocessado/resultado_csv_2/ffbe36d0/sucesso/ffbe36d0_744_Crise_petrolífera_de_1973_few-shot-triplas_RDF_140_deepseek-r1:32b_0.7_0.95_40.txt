Okay, so I need to help create a set of 10 question-answer pairs based on the context provided about the 1973 oil crisis. The user has already given an example and some rules to follow. Let me go through this step by step.

First, I should understand the context thoroughly. The oil crisis started in October 1973 when OPAEP members imposed an embargo on countries supporting Israel during the Yom Kippur War. The affected nations were initially Canada, Japan, Netherlands, UK, and USA, later expanding to Portugal, Rhodesia, and South Africa. Prices rose from $3 to about $12 per barrel globally, with even higher prices in the US. This led to a significant economic impact known as the first oil shock, followed by another crisis in 1979.

The facts provided include various classifications of the event, images, templates used on Wikipedia pages, and categories related to economics, international relations, etc. The example questions cover aspects like when it started, price changes, who was involved, outcomes, and other related events like the second oil shock.

Now, I need to generate 10 unique and varied questions covering different angles of this crisis without repeating similar ones. Each question should have a single correct answer derived from the context or implied by it.

I'll start brainstorming possible questions:

1. What triggered the 1973 oil crisis?
   - The embargo by OPAEP members during Yom Kippur War.

2. Which countries were initially targeted by the embargo?
   - Canada, Japan, Netherlands, UK, USA.

3. How much did oil prices increase globally?
   - From $3 to $12 per barrel.

4. What was the impact on the US oil prices?
   - Prices were even higher than elsewhere.

5. When did the embargo end?
   - March 1974.

6. What nickname was given to this crisis?
   - First oil shock.

7. Which countries joined later the embargo list?
   - Portugal, Rhodesia, South Africa.

8. How long did the embargo last?
   - From October 1973 to March 1974 (approx. 6 months).

9. What were some global effects of the crisis?
   - Economic and political impacts, inflation.

10. When was the second oil shock?
    - 1979.

I think these cover different aspects: causes, affected countries, economic impact, duration, nicknames, and related events. Each has a clear answer from the context.

Now, I need to phrase them as questions and ensure each is unique and within the provided information. Let me check if any of these were already used in the example. The example included when it started, price in March 1974, second crisis year, another term (first shock), who imposed embargo, nations separating from US, Nixon's negotiation, Kissinger's date, embargo end date, and Bretton Woods withdrawal.

So I need to avoid duplicating these. For instance, the question about when the embargo ended is already there, so perhaps adjust it to ask how long the embargo lasted instead.

Let me revise:

1. What caused the 1973 oil crisis?
   - The embargo by OPAEP during Yom Kippur War.

2. Which countries were initially targeted?
   - Canada, Japan, Netherlands, UK, USA.

3. How much did oil prices increase?
   - From $3 to $12 globally; higher in US.

4. What was the duration of the embargo?
   - From October 1973 to March 1974 (about 6 months).

5. What nickname was used for this crisis?
   - First oil shock.

6. Which additional countries were added later?
   - Portugal, Rhodesia, South Africa.

7. What was the impact on global economy?
   - Caused economic and political effects, inflation.

8. When did the second oil crisis occur?
   - 1979.

I think I can add two more questions about the consequences or other related events. Maybe:

9. How did the embargo affect daily life in the US?
   - Gas rationing, long lines, etc. (But context doesn't mention this, so maybe not.)

Alternatively:

9. What was the purpose of the embargo?
   - To pressure countries supporting Israel.

10. Which organization imposed the embargo?
    - OPAEP (Organização dos Países Árabes Exportadores de Petróleo).

Wait, question 10 is similar to one in the example but phrased differently. Maybe adjust it to ask about the group's name.

Alternatively, perhaps include a question about the effect on oil prices specifically in the US compared to elsewhere.

But I need to ensure all answers are directly supported by the context without making assumptions beyond what's provided.

I think with these points, I can structure 10 unique questions covering different aspects of the crisis.
