Okay, I need to generate 10 pairs of questions and answers based on the provided context about the Black Death. Let me start by carefully reading through the context and facts given.

First, the Black Death is described as the most devastating pandemic in human history, killing 75-200 million people in Eurasia, peaking in Europe between 1347-1351. The cause is Yersinia pestis, leading to bubonic, pneumonic, and septicemic plague. It originated in Central or Eastern Asia, spread via the Silk Road, reached Crimea by 1343, and then spread through Genoese merchant ships via fleas on rats. It killed 30-60% of Europe's population, reducing the world population from 475 million to 350-375 million in the 14th century. Europe took 200 years to recover, with places like Florence only recovering in the 19th century. It recurred as outbreaks until the early 20th century.

Now, I need to create 10 varied questions covering different aspects. Let me list possible topics:

1. Origin of the Black Death
2. Cause (Yersinia pestis and its forms)
3. Spread path (Silk Road, Crimea, Genoese ships)
4. Death toll (75-200 million, 30-60% in Europe)
5. Impact on population (world and Europe)
6. Recovery time (Europe's recovery)
7. Specific regions (Florence)
8. Recurrence of the plague
9. Role of fleas and rats
10. Historical references (Geoffrey the Baker's quote)

I need to ensure each question is unique and based on the facts. Let me check if each of these points is covered in the context. The facts mention the origin, cause, spread, death toll, population impact, recovery, specific regions, recurrence, fleas, and historical quotes. That's 10 points. Perfect.

Now, formulating each question and answer in Portuguese, ensuring they are clear and based on the context. Let me start drafting each pair.

1. Origin: Where did the Black Death originate?
2. Cause: What is the cause of the Black Death?
3. Spread via Silk Road: How did the Black Death spread to Europe?
4. Death toll: How many people did the Black Death kill in Eurasia?
5. European death percentage: What percentage of Europe's population was killed by the Black Death?
6. World population: How did the world population change during the Black Death?
7. Recovery in Europe: How long did it take for Europe to recover from the Black Death?
8. Florence recovery: When did Florence recover from the Black Death?
9. Recurrence: When did the Black Death return as outbreaks?
10. Fleas and rats: How did the Black Death spread through the Mediterranean?

I need to check each answer against the context. For example, the origin is Central or Eastern Asia. The cause is Yersinia pestis. Spread via Silk Road to Crimea, then via Genoese ships. Death toll 75-200 million. Europe's 30-60%. World population from 475M to 350-375M. Europe took 200 years. Florence in 19th century. Recurrence until early 20th century. Fleas on rats in ships.

Each answer should be concise and directly from the text. I need to make sure there are no repetitions and that each question is distinct. Let me check if all answers are correctly derived from the context. Once that's confirmed, I can structure them into the JSON format as specified.
