Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs based on the provided context and facts. Let me start by carefully reading the context and the facts to understand what information is available.

The context says that the Yuan Dynasty was founded by Kublai Khan, the grandson of Genghis Khan, in 1271. The facts include various entries from DBpedia, which mention things like battles, people, temples, and other entities associated with the Yuan Dynasty. Also, there's detailed information about the Yuan Dynasty's capital, currency, dissolution date, and other attributes.

First, I should identify key points from the context and facts. The main points are:

- Founder: Kublai Khan, grandson of Genghis Khan.
- Establishment year: 1271.
- Capital cities: Khanbaliq and Shangdu.
- Dissolution date: 1368.
- Currency: Cash (Chinese coin).
- Related events: Battles like Battle of Yamen, Mongol conquest of the Song dynasty, Red Turban Rebellion.
- Related places: Haihui Temple, Xiyuan Temple, Penghu.
- Related people: Ajall Shams al-Din Omar, Chen Yuanjing, Duke Yansheng, Gegeen Khan, etc.
- Other info: Religions practiced, administrative structure, etc.

Now, I need to create varied questions that cover different aspects. Let me brainstorm possible questions:

1. Who founded the Yuan Dynasty?
   Answer: Kublai Khan, the grandson of Genghis Khan.

2. In which year was the Yuan Dynasty formally established?
   Answer: 1271.

3. What were the capital cities of the Yuan Dynasty?
   Answer: Khanbaliq and Shangdu.

4. When did the Yuan Dynasty dissolve?
   Answer: 1368.

5. What was the currency used during the Yuan Dynasty?
   Answer: Cash (Chinese coin).

6. Which significant battle is associated with the Yuan Dynasty?
   Answer: Battle of Yamen.

7. What is the name of the temple established during the Yuan Dynasty in Xiangtan?
   Answer: Haihui Temple.

8. Who was a notable figure associated with the Yuan Dynasty mentioned in the facts?
   Answer: Gegeen Khan.

9. What rebellion is linked to the Yuan Dynasty according to the facts?
   Answer: Red Turban Rebellions.

10. Which dynasty succeeded the Yuan Dynasty?
   Answer: The Northern Yuan dynasty.

I need to ensure that each question is unique and covers different aspects. Let me check if these questions are all covered in the context and facts. The first four questions are directly from the context. The next ones are based on the facts provided. The last question about the Northern Yuan dynasty is mentioned in the facts under eventPost. That should be okay.

Now, I need to phrase the answers accurately based on the sources. For example, the capital cities are mentioned as Khanbaliq and Shangdu. The currency is Cash (Chinese coin). The Battle of Yamen is listed under events. Haihui Temple is in the facts. Gegeen Khan is mentioned as a leader. The Red Turban Rebellions are in the events. The Northern Yuan dynasty is mentioned as the successor.

I should make sure that the answers are precise and directly supported by the context or facts. Also, avoid any information not present. For example, the answer to question 10 is from eventPost: "Formation of Northern Yuan dynasty" after the Yuan's dissolution.

That should cover 10 questions. Let me check again for redundancy. Each question is about a different topic: founder, year, capitals, dissolution, currency, battle, temple, person, rebellion, and successor dynasty. Looks good. Now, format them as per the instructions.
