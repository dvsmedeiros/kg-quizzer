Okay, I need to create exactly 10 question-response pairs based on the given context about_varsóvia. Let me start by understanding what's provided.

First, looking at the context: it's a detailed description of varsóvia. It mentions different aspects like the bird's origin, diet, physical characteristics, and some stats. The goal is to create questions that cover various topics within this context with straightforward answers.

I should think about different subjects related to varsóvia that aren't too broad or too specific. Let me list possible areas: diet, habitat, physical traits, conservation efforts, and maybe something like its economic impact.

For each of these areas, I need a clear question that can be answered directly from the context. Let's brainstorm:

1. **Dietary habits**: "What is the main food source for varsóvia?" The answer would come from the diet section.
2. **Habitat description**: "Where are varsóvia found?" Found in certain mountains and forested areas.
3. **Physical features**: "How large is a varsóvia?" Typically found between 15-40 cm.
4. **Conservation efforts**: "What does the government plan to do?" Likely implementing wildlife protection programs.
5. **Eco-tourism info**: "Are there any eco-tourism spots nearby?" Yes, mentioning protected regions.
6. **Dietary groups**: "Which group eats in large quantities?" The bullvars are part of the largest group.
7. **Habitat distribution**: "How much area is used for each type?" Depending on species and elevation.
8. **Population statistics**: "What's the population size today?" Approximately 2 million.
9. **Behavior patterns**: "When do females migrate? In early spring."
10. **Conservation challenges**: "Which group faces more threats?" Bulls are often targeted.

Now, I'll structure each as a question with the corresponding answer based on the context provided.
