Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs based on the given context and facts. Let me start by understanding the context and facts provided.

The context explains that civil disobedience is a peaceful protest against unjust laws or oppressive governments, originating from Henry David Thoreau and used by Gandhi and MLK. The facts list various events, groups, and elements related to civil disobedience, like specific protests, organizations, and wiki templates.

First, I should make sure each question is unique and covers different aspects. Let me brainstorm possible questions. For example, asking about the origin, key figures, examples, methods, or related movements.

Looking at the facts, there are mentions of Henry David Thoreau, Gandhi, Martin Luther King, specific events like the 2021 End SARS memorial protest, and groups like Sisters Uncut. Also, there are technical details about wiki templates and categories.

I need to avoid repeating similar questions. For instance, don't ask multiple times about the origin. Instead, vary between origin, key figures, examples, methods, related concepts, etc.

Check if the answers are explicitly or inferentially in the context. For example, "Who formulated the concept of civil disobedience?" The answer is Henry David Thoreau, which is in the context.

Another example: "Which movement used civil disobedience in the US?" Answer could be the Civil Rights Movement, as mentioned in the facts.

Need to ensure that each answer is directly from the provided data. For instance, the context mentions "desobediência civil" is a form of protest against unjust laws, so a question about its purpose could be "O que a desobediência civil visa?" with answer "protestar contra leis injustas."

Also, check for specific events: "Qual evento utilizou métodos de desobediência civil em 2021?" Answer could be "End SARS memorial protest."

Make sure not to use any external knowledge, only the given context and facts. Avoid questions that aren't covered, like specific dates unless mentioned. For example, the context doesn't mention specific dates for events, but some facts have dates like "2021 End SARS memorial protest."

Ensure that each pair is distinct. Let me list possible questions:

1. Who is the originator of civil disobedience?
2. Who applied it in India's independence?
3. Which US movement used it?
4. Example of a protest in 2021?
5. What is the purpose of civil disobedience?
6. Which group used it in the UK?
7. What is a wiki template used?
8. Which event involved the 2020 Kyrgyz Revolution?
9. Who is associated with the concept?
10. What is the main subject of civil disobedience?

Now, check the facts for answers. For example, "Committee of 100 (United Kingdom)" uses civil disobedience, so question about UK groups. Also, "Civil disobedience possui assunto Category:Activism by type" could be a question about its category.

Need to make sure answers are correct based on the facts. For example, "Civil disobedience usa modelo de página wiki Template:Cite book" could be a question about templates.

Avoid redundancy. Let me structure 10 pairs now, ensuring each is unique and based on the data.
