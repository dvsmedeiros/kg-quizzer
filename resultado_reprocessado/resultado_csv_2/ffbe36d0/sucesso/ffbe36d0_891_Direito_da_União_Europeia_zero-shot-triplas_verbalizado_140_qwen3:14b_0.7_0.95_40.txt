Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants 10 question-answer pairs in Portuguese based on the provided context and facts. First, I need to understand the context thoroughly. The main topic is the Law of the European Union, its institutions, objectives, and some related entities like the Common Market Law Review and scholars such as John Bell and Henry G. Schermers.

Looking at the context, key points are the EU's legal system, its origins post-WWII, the objectives of promoting peace and well-being, the institutions that transcend national states, and the legal order as per the Court of Justice. The facts mention specific journals, scholars, and Wikipedia templates used for the Law of the European Union.

Now, I need to generate varied questions that cover different aspects. Let's start with the main objective of the EU's laws. Then, the origin of the EU's legal system. Next, the role of the Court of Justice. Mentioning the Common Market Law Review and its discipline. John Bell's areas of work. Henry Schermers' subdiscipline. The Wikipedia templates used. Also, the institutions that transcend national states. And the legal order as per the Court of Justice.

Wait, need to ensure each question is unique and covers different parts. Let me check the facts again to avoid repetition. The facts list the same journal twice, so maybe focus on that once. Also, the scholar John Bell is mentioned twice, so I can use that for one question. Henry G. Schermers is a subdiscipline, so that's another point. The templates are three different ones, so perhaps one question about the models used. The institutions part is covered in the context. Also, the objective of promoting peace, values, and well-being is a key point.

I need to make sure that each question is distinct and not overlapping. Let me count: 1. Objective, 2. Origin, 3. Court of Justice's role, 4. Common Market Law Review's discipline, 5. John Bell's area, 6. Henry Schermers' subdiscipline, 7. Wikipedia templates, 8. Institutions transcending states, 9. Legal order as per Court of Justice, 10. Main topic of Law of EU. That's 10. Now, phrasing each question in Portuguese, making sure answers are correct and directly from the context or facts. Need to avoid any markdown and ensure correct JSON structure with proper commas and brackets.
