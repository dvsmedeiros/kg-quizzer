Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs based on the provided context and facts about economic inequality. Let me start by carefully reviewing the context and the facts to identify key points.

The context mentions that economic inequality includes income distribution, wealth distribution, and various measurement methods like the Gini coefficient and the Human Development Index adjusted for inequality. It also talks about globalization's effect on inequality between nations versus within countries. There's a mention of concepts like equity, equality of results, and opportunities. Research indicates that higher inequality might hinder growth duration but not its rate.

Looking at the facts, there are several entries about different topics related to economic inequality. For example, the Occupy movements in various cities are linked to economic inequality. There's also information about models used in Wikipedia, such as Template:Wealth, Template:Citation, and others. Some entries mention specific books and authors like Branko Milanović, Robert Wade, and Nora Lustig. Additionally, there are images and data related to income distribution, wealth disparity, and specific indices like the Gini index.

Now, I need to create 10 unique questions that cover different aspects of the context and facts. Let me brainstorm possible questions:

1. What is one of the main methods used to measure economic inequality?
   - Answer: Coeficiente de Gini.

2. Which movement is associated with addressing economic inequality?
   - Answer: Occupy Wall Street.

3. What does the Human Development Index Adjusted for Inequality consider?
   - Answer: It takes into account inequality in the index.

4. How does globalization affect economic inequality between nations and within countries?
   - Answer: It reduces inequality between nations but increases within countries.

5. What is a key factor that research suggests affects the duration of economic growth?
   - Answer: Higher economic inequality.

6. Which book is associated with the study of economic inequality?
   - Answer: Capital in the Twenty-First Century.

7. What does the Gini coefficient measure?
   - Answer: It measures income or wealth distribution.

8. Which economist is known for working on economic inequality?
   - Answer: Branko Milanović.

9. What is an example of an image used to represent economic inequality?
   - Answer: Tenting in Los Angeles Skid Row.jpg.

10. What is one of the main topics covered in the discussion of economic inequality?
    - Answer: Distribution of wealth.

I need to ensure each question is distinct and covers different aspects. Let me verify that each answer is directly inferable from the context or facts provided. Also, I should avoid repeating similar questions. For example, the first question about the Gini coefficient is covered, and the second about Occupy Wall Street is another unique angle. The third question about the HDI Adjusted for Inequality is relevant. The fourth question addresses globalization's impact, which is mentioned in the context. The fifth question refers to research findings about growth duration. The sixth question links a book to the topic. The seventh question is about the Gini coefficient's purpose. The eighth question names an economist. The ninth question refers to an image example. The tenth question is about a main topic. 

Now, I need to structure these into 10 pairs, ensuring that each pair is unique and adheres to the rules. Let me check for any possible overlaps or repetitions. All seem to be distinct. The answers should be concise and directly from the context. For instance, the answer to the first question is "Coeficiente de Gini," which is explicitly mentioned. The answer to the second question is "Occupy Wall Street," which is part of the facts. The third answer is about the HDI Adjusted, which is in the context. The fourth answer references globalization's effect, which is stated. The fifth answer is about research findings. The sixth answer is the book. The seventh is the Gini coefficient's measurement. The eighth is Branko Milanović. The ninth is the image example. The tenth is distribution of wealth. 

I think these questions and answers are valid and cover different aspects. Now, I'll format them into the required JSON structure without any additional text or explanations.
