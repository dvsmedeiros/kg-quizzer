Okay, so I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs based on the provided context and facts about the Yuan dynasty. The user has given a detailed structure and specific requirements, so I should make sure each pair is unique and covers different aspects of the content.

First, let me go through the context again. The Yuan dynasty was founded by Kublai Khan, a grandson of Genghis Khan, in 1271. It's an important period in Chinese history with various military campaigns, cultural influences, religious practices, and significant events like battles and rebellions.

Looking at the facts provided, there are mentions of several battles involving the Yuan dynasty, such as the Battle of Bạch Đằng (1288), Battle of Kōan, Battle of Lake Poyang, etc. These can be good points for questions about military engagements or key events.

There's also information about leaders and notable figures like Kublai Khan, Toghon Temür, and others. This could lead to questions about the dynasty's rulers or significant individuals.

Cultural aspects include the religions practiced during the Yuan dynasty, which were diverse. This can form a question about religious practices.

The dynasty had a capital at Khanbaliq (Dadu), so that's another point for a question regarding the capital city.

Economic aspects might include currency used, like the Cash coin, which could be another question.

Additionally, there are mentions of rebellions such as the Red Turban Rebellions and Ispah rebellion, which can lead to questions about internal conflicts or uprisings during that period.

I should ensure each question is clear and directly related to the facts provided. Also, the answers must be accurate and derived from the given information without adding any external knowledge.

Let me start drafting some questions:

1. When was the Yuan dynasty founded?
   - Answer: 1271

2. Who was the founder of the Yuan dynasty?
   - Answer: Kublai Khan

3. What were the capitals of the Yuan dynasty?
   - Answer: Khanbaliq and Shangdu

4. Which battles did the Yuan dynasty participate in? (I can list a few, but since it's one answer, maybe mention the major ones)
   - Alternatively, ask about a specific battle to make it more precise.

Wait, perhaps I should structure each question to target specific facts rather than broad topics to ensure clarity and avoid repetition.

Another approach is to look at the facts provided in the RDF format. For example:

- The Yuan dynasty was involved in several battles: Battle of Bạch Đằng (1288), Battle of Kōan, etc.
- It had leaders like Toghon Temür.
- Religions included Buddhism, Tengrism, Shamanism, Taoism, Confucianism, folk religion, Nestorian Christianity, Roman Catholic Christianity, Judaism, Manichaeism, and Islam.
- The capital was Khanbaliq (Dadu).
- The currency was Cash.

So, structuring questions around these points would be effective.

Also, considering the end date of the dynasty: 1368.

Let me compile a list:

1. When was the Yuan dynasty established?
   - Answer: In 1271

2. Who founded the Yuan dynasty?
   - Answer: Kublai Khan

3. What were the capitals of the Yuan dynasty?
   - Answer: Khanbaliq (Dadu) and Shangdu

4. Which rebellion led to the fall of the Yuan dynasty?
   - Answer: Red Turban Rebellion

5. What religions were practiced during the Yuan dynasty?
   - Answer: Buddhism, Tengrism, Shamanism, Taoism, Confucianism, folk religion, Nestorian Christianity, Roman Catholic Christianity, Judaism, Manichaeism, and Islam.

6. Who was the last ruler of the Yuan dynasty?
   - Answer: Toghon Temür

7. What was the currency used during the Yuan dynasty?
   - Answer: Cash (монета)

8. Which battle marked a significant defeat for the Yuan dynasty?

9. What was the capital of the Yuan dynasty called in Chinese?
   - Answer: 大都 (Dàdū)

10. When did the Yuan dynasty end?

I think this covers a range of topics from founding, rulers, capitals, economy, religion, significant events, and end date. Each question is specific and based on the provided facts.
