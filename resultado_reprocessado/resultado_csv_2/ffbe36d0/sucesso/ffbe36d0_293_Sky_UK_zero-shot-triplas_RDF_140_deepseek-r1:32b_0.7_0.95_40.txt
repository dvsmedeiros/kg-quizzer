Okay, so I'm trying to create 10 question-answer pairs based on the provided context about British Satellite Broadcasting (BSB). Let me first read through all the information carefully.

From the context, BSB was a TV company in London that started satellite broadcasts for the UK. It merged with Sky Television in November 1990 to form BSkyB and began transmitting on March 25, 1990. There are also several facts listed about different TV channels and films associated with BSB as their owner or production company.

I need to make sure each question is unique and covers different aspects of the content. I'll start by identifying key points: founding date, merger details, launch date, owned channels like Galaxy, The Computer Channel, etc., and films produced by BSB.

Now, I'll think about potential questions. Maybe one about when it was established, another about what it merged into, and the launch date. Then, questions about specific channels and movies they were involved with. Each question should have a clear, correct answer from the provided data without any extra information.

I also need to make sure that each pair is in Portuguese as specified. Let me start drafting these questions one by one, ensuring variety and covering different aspects of BSB's history and operations.
