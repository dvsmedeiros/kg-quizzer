Okay, so I need to help the user generate 10 question-answer pairs based on the given context about oxygen. Let me read through the context again carefully.

The context talks about oxygen's atomic number, its role in the atmosphere, its discovery by different scientists, uses, and properties. There are also some facts from DBpedia which mention products related to oxygen and people known for it.

First, I'll note down key points: oxygen is element 8, part of the chalcogens group, forms O2, used in various industries like steel production, discovered by Scheele and Priestley, named by Lavoisier, used in breathing gases, contributes to ozone layer protection, etc.

Now, I need to create questions that cover these points without being too similar. I'll make sure each question is clear and the answer is directly from the text.

1. Atomic number: Should be straightforward.
2. Abundance after hydrogen: Helium is second, but wait, the context says oxygen is third overall, so the second most abundant in Earth's crust?
3. Percentage of O2 in atmosphere: 20.8% or around there.
4. Ozone layer protection: Yes, because ozone contains oxygen.
5. Main group: Chalcogens.
6. Common compounds: Oxides.
7. Used in which industry: Steel production.
8. Discovery by multiple scientists: Scheele and Priestley.
9. Storage containers: Compressed gas cylinders.
10. Toxicity at high concentrations: Yes.

I need to phrase these into questions, making sure each is unique and not repeating the same information too much. Also, check that answers are concise and accurate based on context.

Here are 10 question-answer pairs based on the provided context about oxygen:

1. **Question:** What is the atomic number of oxygen?  
   **Answer:** The atomic number of oxygen is 8.

2. **Question:** How abundant is oxygen compared to other elements in the Earth's crust?  
   **Answer:** Oxygen is the second most abundant element after hydrogen in the Earth's crust.

3. **Question:** What percentage of the Earth's atmosphere does oxygen (O₂) compose?  
   **Answer:** Oxygen composes approximately 20.8% of the Earth's atmosphere.

4. **Question:** Does oxygen contribute to the protection of life on Earth by forming part of the ozone layer?  
   **Answer:** Yes, oxygen contributes to the ozone layer as ozone (O₃) contains oxygen atoms.

5. **Question:** To which main group in the periodic table does oxygen belong?  
   **Answer:** Oxygen belongs to the chalcogens group in the periodic table.

6. **Question:** What type of compounds do most elements form when reacting with oxygen?  
   **Answer:** Most elements form oxides when reacting with oxygen.

7. **Question:** In which industry is liquid oxygen commonly used as a raw material?  
   **Answer:** Liquid oxygen is commonly used in the steel production industry.

8. **Question:** Who were the key scientists involved in the discovery of oxygen?  
   **Answer:** Carl Wilhelm Scheele and Joseph Priestley were key scientists in discovering oxygen.

9. **Question:** How is oxygen typically stored for industrial or medical use?  
   **Answer:** Oxygen is typically stored in compressed gas cylinders for industrial or medical use.

10. **Question:** Can high concentrations of oxygen become toxic to humans?  
    **Answer:** Yes, high concentrations of oxygen can be toxic to humans and cause oxygen toxicity.

These pairs cover various aspects of oxygen's properties, discovery, uses, and effects, providing a comprehensive overview based on the given context.
