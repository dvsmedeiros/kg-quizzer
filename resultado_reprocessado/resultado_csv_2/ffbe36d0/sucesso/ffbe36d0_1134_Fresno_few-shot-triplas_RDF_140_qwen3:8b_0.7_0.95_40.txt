Okay, I need to generate 10 more question-answer pairs about Fresno, California, based on the provided data. Let me start by reviewing the examples given to understand the pattern and the types of questions that are being asked.

The examples include questions about population rankings, distance, meaning of the city name, symbols on the flag, pronunciation, historical events like the railroad station establishment, reasons for migration, incorporation year, trolley numbers, and entities driving growth. The answers are concise, often numerical or specific facts.

Now, looking at the data provided, there's a lot of information about Fresno's attributes. Let me go through the data again to find relevant details that can form new questions. 

First, the data mentions that Fresno is classified as an "Area108497294," "Group100031264," "Site108651247," and "WikicatCountySeatsInCalifornia." Also, there's a note about the area total being 300.438620798976 square miles, and the area code is 559. The government type is "Strong Mayor," and the settlement type is a list of municipalities in California. The coordinates are 36.75, -119.76666666666667. 

There's also information about the city's official website templates, subjects like "Category:San_Joaquin_Valley," and exact matches to a Global WordNet entry. The depiction is a Wikimedia Commons image link.

From the examples, I can see that questions often focus on specific facts, historical events, geographical details, and cultural aspects. So, I need to create questions that are similar in style and content.

Possible questions could be about the area code, population, government structure, coordinates, or historical events related to the city. Also, maybe the significance of the San Joaquin Valley category, the exact match in Global WordNet, or the depiction image.

Wait, the examples include questions about the city's incorporation year (1885), which is mentioned in the data. The data also mentions the area total, which could be used for a question about the size of the city. The area code is 559, so that's a possible question. The government type is "Strong Mayor," so a question about the type of government could be formed. The coordinates could be used to ask for the location or the exact coordinates. The San Joaquin Valley category might relate to the region's significance. The exact match in Global WordNet might be about the city's name meaning. The depiction image could be asked about, like what the image shows.

However, I need to ensure that the questions are not redundant with the existing examples. The existing examples already cover the incorporation year, distance, meaning of the name, flag, pronunciation, railroad station year, reasons for migration, trolley numbers, and growth entity. So I should focus on other aspects.

Let me list possible questions:

1. What is the area code of Fresno?
2. What is the total area of Fresno in square miles?
3. What type of government does Fresno have?
4. What are the geographic coordinates of Fresno?
5. What is the significance of the San Joaquin Valley category for Fresno?
6. What is the exact match of Fresno's name in the Global WordNet?
7. What does the depiction image of Fresno show?
8. What is the population ranking of Fresno in California?
9. When was the Fresno Traction Company established?
10. What are the main industries or economic drivers of Fresno?

Wait, but the data doesn't mention the population ranking, except in the first example. However, the first example already asks about the fifth largest city. Maybe the data doesn't provide population numbers, so I can't form that question. Let me check the data again.

Looking back, the data mentions that Fresno is a "WikicatCountySeatsInCalifornia," which might relate to being a county seat. But the examples already have a question about the city's rank. So maybe the question about being a county seat. Also, the data includes "dcterms:subject <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:San_Joaquin_Valley>," so a question about that category.

So, possible questions:

1. What is the area code of Fresno?
2. What is the total area of Fresno?
3. What type of government does Fresno have?
4. What are the geographic coordinates of Fresno?
5. What is the significance of the San Joaquin Valley category for Fresno?
6. What is the exact match of Fresno's name in the Global WordNet?
7. What does the depiction image of Fresno show?
8. What is the population ranking of Fresno in California?
9. What are the main industries or economic drivers of Fresno?
10. What is the role of Fresno as a county seat?

But some of these might not have direct answers from the data. For example, the main industries or economic drivers aren't mentioned. The data does mention the Sun-Maid company, which is a local company, so maybe that's a point. Also, the Twining Laboratories are mentioned, which could relate to industries.

Alternatively, since the data includes "Sun-Maid" as a location, maybe a question about that. Also, the Physicians Building and Oak Brook College of Law and Government Policy are mentioned as locations, which could be part of the economic or cultural aspects.

But since the examples already have some questions about the city's history and infrastructure, maybe the new questions should focus on other aspects like the area code, government type, coordinates, the San Joaquin Valley category, the Global WordNet exact match, the depiction image, and the role as a county seat.

So, I'll structure the 10 questions based on these points, ensuring they are distinct from the examples and answerable from the data.
