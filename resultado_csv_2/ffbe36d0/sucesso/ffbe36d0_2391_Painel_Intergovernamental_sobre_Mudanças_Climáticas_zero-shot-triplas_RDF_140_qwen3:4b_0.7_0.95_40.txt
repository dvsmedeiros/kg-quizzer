Okay, I need to generate 10 objective question-answer pairs based on the provided context and facts about the IPCC. Let me start by carefully reading the context and facts given.

The context explains that the IPCC is a scientific-political organization created in 1988 by the UN, through PNUMA and WMO. Its main goal is to synthesize and disseminate the latest knowledge on climate change, specifically global warming, its causes, effects, and risks. It doesn't conduct original research but summarizes work from top scientists. It's the main authority for climate policies but faces criticism. It has produced five major reports and some other documents, with the first in 1990 and the last in 2014. The Nobel Peace Prize in 2007 was awarded to it for its work.

The facts mention various people associated with the IPCC, like Bert Bolin, Filippo Giorgi, Julia Slingo, etc., and also the organization's headquarters in Geneva, parent organizations, and its role in climate change mitigation. Also, the acronym IPCC is mentioned, and the Nobel Prize.

Now, I need to create 10 different questions. The questions should cover different aspects: what the IPCC is, its creation, its purpose, its structure, its role, its awards, its associated organizations, its members, its reports, and maybe its headquarters.

Let me make sure each question is unique and based on the facts. For example:

1. What is the full name of the organization known as IPCC?
2. When was the IPCC established?
3. What is the main objective of the IPCC?
4. Which organizations are associated with the creation of the IPCC?
5. What is the headquarters of the IPCC?
6. What award did the IPCC receive in 2007?
7. What is the role of the IPCC in climate policy?
8. Who are some of the notable individuals associated with the IPCC?
9. How many major reports has the IPCC produced?
10. What is the primary function of the IPCC according to the context?

I need to check if these questions are all based on the provided facts. The first question is answered by the full name, which is given in the context. The second question is about the establishment year, which is 1988. The third is the main objective, which is in the context. The fourth mentions PNUMA and WMO. The fifth is Geneva. The sixth is the Nobel Peace Prize. The seventh is about its role in policies. The eighth lists some individuals. The ninth is five major reports. The tenth is the primary function, which is to synthesize and disseminate knowledge.

I need to make sure each answer is correct and directly from the context. Also, avoid repetition. Let me verify each point again against the context to ensure accuracy.
