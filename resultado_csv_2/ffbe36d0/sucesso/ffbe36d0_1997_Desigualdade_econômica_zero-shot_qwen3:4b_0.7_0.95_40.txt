Okay, I need to generate 10 objective questions and answers based on the context provided, which is "Desigualdade_econômica" (Economic Inequality). The user wants the questions in Portuguese, each with a unique and relevant answer. Let me start by recalling the key aspects of economic inequality.

First, I should identify different aspects of economic inequality. These could include causes, effects, measurements, policies, examples, and related concepts. Since the user mentioned that the answers should be either explicit or inferable from the context, I need to make sure each question is directly related to the content provided.

Wait, the user didn't provide a specific text or data, just the topic. So maybe the context is the general topic of economic inequality. But the user might have intended that the context is the content they mentioned earlier, but in this case, the user provided the context as "Desigualdade_econômica" and the instruction to generate questions based on that. However, since there's no actual content given, I need to assume that the context is the general topic of economic inequality. But that's a bit vague. Maybe the user expects me to create questions based on common knowledge about economic inequality, but the instructions say to generate questions based on the context provided. Since the user only provided the topic, I need to make sure the questions are about economic inequality without any specific text. 

Alternatively, perhaps the user intended that the context is the content they previously provided, but in this case, the user hasn't provided any text. Therefore, I need to generate questions based on the general knowledge of economic inequality, but according to the rules, the answers must be explicit or inferable from the content. Since there's no content, maybe the user expects me to create questions that are standard in the field of economic inequality. However, the user might have made a mistake in the context. But given the instructions, I'll proceed to generate 10 questions and answers about economic inequality in Portuguese, making sure they are varied and cover different aspects.

Let me think of possible aspects: causes (like income distribution, access to education, opportunities), effects (poverty, social unrest), measurement (Gini coefficient, poverty lines), policies (taxation, social programs), examples (wealth gap between nations, within countries), historical context, etc.

Now, I need to create 10 unique questions. Let's list them:

1. What is the main cause of economic inequality according to the context?
2. How does economic inequality affect social stability?
3. What is a common measure used to assess economic inequality?
4. What is the primary goal of progressive taxation in reducing inequality?
5. What are some examples of economic inequality within a country?
6. How does education impact economic inequality?
7. What is the Gini coefficient and what does it measure?
8. What are the effects of economic inequality on healthcare access?
9. What is the role of government policies in reducing economic inequality?
10. How does technological advancement influence economic inequality?

Now, I need to translate these into Portuguese, ensuring the answers are correct and based on the context. Since the context is "Desigualdade_econômica", I need to make sure the answers are general but accurate. For example, the Gini coefficient is a standard measure, progressive taxation aims to reduce inequality, etc. I'll check each question to ensure they are distinct and cover different aspects. Also, avoid repeating similar questions. The answers should be concise and directly answer the question.
