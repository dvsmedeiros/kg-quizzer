Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs based on the provided context and facts about the University of Chicago. Let me start by reading through the context and facts carefully to understand the key points.

First, the context mentions that the University of Chicago is a private research university in Chicago, Illinois. It has various schools and divisions, like the Pritzker School of Medicine, Booth School of Business, etc. The student numbers are 5,971 undergraduates and 16,016 total. They have a high concentration of Nobel laureates and other notable alumni.

Looking at the facts section, there are a lot of names of people associated with the university, such as alumni, faculty, and researchers. Also, there's information about the number of students (18,452), rankings (USNWR world rank 15), and some specific details like the Chicago Pile-1, Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, and the Barack Obama Presidential Center.

Now, the user wants 10 pairs. Each question should be different and cover various aspects. Let me list possible questions:

1. What is the total number of students at the University of Chicago? The facts mention 18,452, so that's a direct answer.
2. Which university is known for its high concentration of Nobel laureates? The context says 98 Nobel winners are affiliated.
3. What is the name of the university's press? The context mentions University of Chicago Press.
4. Which famous nuclear reactor was developed at the University of Chicago? Chicago Pile-1.
5. What is the world ranking of the University of Chicago? The facts say USNWR world rank 15.
6. Which school is part of the University of Chicago's professional schools? Examples include Booth School of Business.
7. Who is associated with the development of the first self-sustaining nuclear reaction? The department of physics and the Met Lab.
8. What is the name of the presidential center at the University of Chicago? Barack Obama Presidential Center.
9. Which famous scientist is an alumnus of the University of Chicago? Carl Sagan is mentioned.
10. What is the university's model for Wikipedia pages? Template:Main list or Template:University of Chicago.

Wait, need to check if these answers are directly from the context or facts. For example, the number of students is 18,452 in the facts, but the context says 16,016 total. Wait, the context says "16 016 alunos no total" and the facts say "University of Chicago possui número de estudantes 18452". There's a discrepancy here. Which one to use? The facts might be more recent. So, the total number of students is 18,452.

Another point: the context mentions that the university has seven professional schools. That's a fact from the context. So, the question about the number of professional schools would be 7.

Also, the context mentions that the university is part of the USNWR world ranking 15. So that's another question.

I need to make sure each question is unique and covers different aspects. Let me structure the 10 pairs accordingly, ensuring that the answers are directly from the provided content.
