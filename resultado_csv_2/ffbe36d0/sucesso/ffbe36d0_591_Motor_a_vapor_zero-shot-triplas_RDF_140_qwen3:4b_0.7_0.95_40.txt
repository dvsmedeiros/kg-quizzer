Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs based on the provided data about the Steam Engine. Let me start by understanding the information given.

The data includes various entities related to steam engines. There are ship names like USS_Montauk, USS_Shenandoah, and others that have 'steam_engine' as their power type. There are also companies like Wm._Crichton_&_Co. that produce steam engines. The Steam_engine itself has some templates and categories associated with it, like energy conversion and steam engines. There are also images related to steam engines from Wikimedia Commons.

Now, the user wants 10 question-answer pairs. The questions should be in Portuguese, and the answers should be based on the data provided. Let me think about possible questions that can be formed from this data.

First, I can ask about the companies that produce steam engines. The data mentions Wm._Crichton_&_Co. and Marshall & Co. (maybe from the first line about King & Marshall & Co.?). Wait, the first line mentions King & Marshall & Co. as a shipbuilder. Wait, the first line is: "King & Marshall & Co. (1855–1941) was a shipbuilding company based in London, England. They built many steam-powered ships." So that's a company that built steam-powered ships.

So maybe a question: Which company was based in London and built steam-powered ships? Answer: King & Marshall & Co.

Another point is the Steam_engine's categories, like Category:Energy_conversion and Category:Steam_engines. So a question could be: What are the categories associated with the Steam_engine? Answer: Energy conversion and Steam engines.

There are also specific ships listed, like USS_Montauk, USS_Shenandoah, etc. So a question could be: What is the name of a ship that uses a steam engine? Answer: USS_Montauk.

The data also mentions that the Steam_engine has templates like Template:Citation_needed, Template:Clarify, etc. So a question about the templates used for the Steam_engine.

Also, there are images related to steam engines, so a question about the images associated with the Steam_engine.

Another angle is the use of steam engines in different applications, like in ships, locomotives, or other machinery. The data mentions that the Steam_engine is used in various applications, so a question about that.

I need to make sure that each question is unique and based on the data. Let me list possible questions:

1. Which company was based in London and built steam-powered ships?
2. What are the categories associated with the Steam_engine?
3. What is the name of a ship that uses a steam engine?
4. What are the templates used for the Steam_engine?
5. What is the power type of the Virginia V?
6. Which company produces steam engines?
7. What are some examples of ships using steam engines?
8. What are the images associated with the Steam_engine?
9. What is the significance of the Steam_engine in energy conversion?
10. What are the applications of the Steam_engine?

Now, I need to check if these questions are covered in the data. Let me verify each one:

1. Yes, King & Marshall & Co.
2. Yes, Energy_conversion and Steam_engines.
3. Yes, USS_Montauk.
4. The templates listed include Citation_needed, Clarify, etc.
5. Virginia V's power type is Steam_engine.
6. Wm._Crichton_&_Co. and King & Marshall & Co.
7. Examples: USS_Montauk, USS_Shenandoah, USS_Tasco, etc.
8. The images listed in the Steam_engine's depiction.
9. The Steam_engine is a key in energy conversion, so that's covered.
10. Applications include ships, locomotives, etc.

I think these questions are valid. Now, I'll format them into 10 pairs in Portuguese, making sure the answers are accurate based on the data provided.
