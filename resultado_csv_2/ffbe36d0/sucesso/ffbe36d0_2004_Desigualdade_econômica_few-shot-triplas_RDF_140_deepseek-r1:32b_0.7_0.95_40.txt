Okay, so I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs based on the provided context and facts about economic inequality. Let me start by understanding what's given.

The context explains that economic inequality refers to the distribution of income and wealth, both between countries and within them. It mentions different types of measurements like the Gini coefficient and the Inequality-Adjusted Human Development Index. It also touches on concepts like equity, equality of outcomes, and opportunities. Additionally, it notes that while globalization reduces global inequality between nations, it increases inequality within countries.

Looking at the facts, there are several resources linked to economic inequality, such as books, movements, and scholars. For example, Branko Milanović and Robert Wade are mentioned as experts in this field. Movements like Occupy Wall Street are cited as being caused by economic inequality. There's also a mention of specific images that depict wealth disparity, like contrasting affluent houses with homeless encampments.

Now, I need to create varied questions covering different aspects without repeating similar ones. Each question should have one correct answer derived from the provided information.

Let me brainstorm possible questions:

1. What are the two main types of economic inequality discussed?
   - Renda e riqueza

2. Which index adjusts for inequality in human development?
   - Índice de Desenvolvimento Humano Ajustado pela Desigualdade

3. What is a common method to measure economic inequality?
   - Coeficiente de Gini

4. Who are two scholars focusing on economic inequality?
   - Branko Milanović e Robert Wade

5. How does globalization affect global inequality between countries?
   - Reduz a desigualdade global entre nações

6. What is the impact of higher inequality on economic growth duration?
   - Dificulta a duração do crescimento

7. Which movement in Pakistan was caused by economic inequality?
   - Movimento de 1968 no Paquistão

8. What book discusses wealth and nations using IQ as a factor?
   - "IQ and the Wealth of Nations"

9. How does globalization influence inequality within countries?
   - Aumenta a desigualdade dentro dos países

10. Which movement in Alt Llobregat was caused by economic issues?
    - Anarquista insurreição do Alt Llobregat

I think these cover different aspects: definitions, measurements, scholars, effects of globalization, specific examples, and impacts on growth. Each answer is directly supported by the context or facts provided.
