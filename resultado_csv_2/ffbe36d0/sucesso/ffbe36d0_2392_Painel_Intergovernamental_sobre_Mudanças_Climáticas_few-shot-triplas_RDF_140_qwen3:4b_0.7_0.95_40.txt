Okay, I need to generate 10 objective questions and answers based on the provided context and facts about the IPCC. Let me start by carefully reading through the given information to ensure I understand all the key points.

First, the context explains that the IPCC is an intergovernmental organization established in 1988 under the UN by the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). Its main goal is to synthesize and disseminate the latest scientific knowledge on climate change, including causes, effects, and risks. It doesn't conduct original research but compiles work from top scientists. It's the main authority on global warming, used for international climate policies, but faces criticism. It has produced five major reports and some other documents, with the first in 1990 and the last in 2014. The Nobel Peace Prize in 2007 was awarded to it for its work.

The facts include information about key individuals associated with the IPCC, like Bert Bolin, Filippo Giorgi, Julia Slingo, etc. There's also info about the headquarters in Geneva, the parent organizations, and the leader, Hoesung Lee, who is the current chair. Also, Rajendra Pachauri was a former chairman, and he resigned in February 2015.

Now, I need to create 10 distinct questions that cover different aspects. Let me list possible questions:

1. What is the full name of the IPCC in Portuguese?
2. Which organizations established the IPCC?
3. What is the main purpose of the IPCC?
4. When was the IPCC established?
5. Which organization is the headquarters of the IPCC?
6. Who is the current chair of the IPCC?
7. What is the main award received by the IPCC?
8. How many major reports has the IPCC produced?
9. When was the first major report of the IPCC published?
10. When did Rajendra Pachauri resign as chairman?

I need to make sure each question is unique and based on the facts. Let me check if these questions are covered in the context. The first question is about the full name in Portuguese, which is mentioned in the context as "Painel Intergovernamental sobre Mudanças Climáticas". The second question is about the organizations that established it, which are UNEP and WMO. The main purpose is mentioned as synthesizing and disseminating knowledge on climate change. The establishment date is 1988. Headquarters in Geneva. Current chair is Hoesung Lee. The Nobel Prize in 2007. The number of major reports is five. First report in 1990. Pachauri resigned in February 2015.

I need to phrase these questions correctly in Portuguese, using the exact terms from the context. Also, check for any possible overlaps or similar questions. For example, the question about the current chair is different from the first one about the full name. The first major report is 1990, which is covered. The resignation of Pachauri is mentioned in the facts. 

I should ensure that each answer is directly taken from the context or the facts provided. For example, the headquarters is Geneva, as per the facts. The Nobel Prize is in 2007. The current chair is Hoesung Lee. The number of reports is five. The first report in 1990. Rajendra Pachauri's resignation in February 2015.

Now, compiling all these into 10 distinct questions and answers, making sure they are in Portuguese and accurate.
