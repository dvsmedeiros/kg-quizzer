Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs based on the given context and facts about Southern California. Let me start by understanding what's provided.

The context explains that Southern California is an informal region of the third part of California without clear boundaries. It mentions geographical features like the Pacific Ocean to the west, the US-Mexico border to the south, and Arizona to the east. The population in 2019 was about 23.8 million.

Looking at the facts, there are several points that can be turned into questions. For example, the abbreviation "SoCal" is mentioned, which could be a question about how Southern California is commonly abbreviated. Another fact is the population figure from 2019, so a question about the population could be asked.

I should make sure each question is unique and covers different aspects. Let me go through the facts one by one:

- South Pasadena Local: Maybe a question about cities or locations in Southern California.
- Earthquakes (e.g., Whittier Narrows in 1987): Can ask which earthquakes affected the region.
- Companies like Fosselman's Ice Cream and Robinsons-May: Perhaps ask which companies serve Southern California.
- Images associated with Southern California: Maybe about famous landmarks or photos.
- Notable people born there, such as Jill Barnett and Robert D. Cardona: A question about famous individuals from SoCal.
- Organizations like USC Trojans rugby team: Could ask about sports teams in the region.
- Geographic subdivisions like Orange County: Questions about specific counties or areas within Southern California.
- Population statistics from 2020: Another population-related question, but I need to check if this is the same as the 2019 figure or different.
- Infrastructure like Metrolink and various railway lines: Could ask about transportation systems in SoCal.
- Natural features such as Santiago Canyon Fire and Three Arch Bay: Questions about notable places or events.

I should avoid repeating similar questions. For example, if I already have a question about population, I shouldn't make another one unless it's significantly different, like comparing two years.

Let me structure each pair:

1. Abbreviation of Southern California.
2. Earthquake in 1987 affecting the region.
3. Companies serving Southern California (maybe list two examples).
4. Notable individuals born there.
5. Population figure from 2019.
6. Image associated with Southern California.
7. Subdivision like Orange County.
8. Sports team based there.
9. Other companies or organizations.
10. Natural feature or event in the region.

Wait, but I need to ensure each question is unique and covers different aspects without overlap. Let me adjust:

1. Abbreviation: "SoCal."
2. Earthquake in 1987: "Whittier Narrows earthquake."
3. Companies serving Southern California: Maybe Fosselman's Ice Cream.
4. Notable person born there: Jill Barnett.
5. Population in 2019: 23.8 million.
6. Image associated with the region: Venice, California Beach.jpg.
7. Subdivision: Orange County.
8. Sports team: USC Trojans men's rugby.
9. Other company: Robinsons-May.
10. Natural feature: Santiago Canyon Fire.

That should cover a variety of aspects without repeating similar questions. Each question addresses a different facet of Southern California, ensuring diversity and relevance.
