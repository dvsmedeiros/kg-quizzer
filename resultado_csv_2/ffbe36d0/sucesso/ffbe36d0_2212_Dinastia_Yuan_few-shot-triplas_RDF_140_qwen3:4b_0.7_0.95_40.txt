Okay, I need to generate 10 objective questions and answers based on the provided context about the Yuan Dynasty. Let me start by reviewing the given context and facts to ensure I cover different aspects.

The context mentions that the Yuan Dynasty was founded by Kublai Khan, a descendant of Genghis Khan, in 1271. It also lists various facts, like battles involving the Yuan, places associated with it, and other related entities. The examples provided include questions about the Chinese name, official name, founder, leader, dates, and related dynasties.

I need to make sure the questions are varied and cover different aspects. Let me think of possible topics: founding, key events, related dynasties, leaders, dates, cultural aspects, and perhaps some specific events or places.

First, the Chinese name is "Yuan cháo" or "Yuán cháo". The official name is "Great Yuan" or "Dà Yuán". The founder is Kublai Khan. The leader mentioned is Toghon Temür. The dates are 1271 to 1368. The predecessor is the Song Dynasty, and the successor is the Ming. Also, there's mention of the Mongol Empire. Other points could be the capital, Dada, or the religious influences.

I should check the examples to avoid repeating them. The examples already have questions about the Chinese name, official name, founder, leader, date of formal declaration, the empire it was part of, predecessor, successor, and Kublai's grandfather. So I need to come up with new ones.

Possible questions:

1. What was the name of the capital of the Yuan Dynasty?
2. Which religion was prominent during the Yuan Dynasty?
3. What was the name of the leader of the Yuan Dynasty?
4. What was the name of the battle that led to the establishment of the Yuan Dynasty?
5. Which dynasty came after the Yuan Dynasty?
6. What was the name of the calendar used during the Yuan Dynasty?
7. What was the name of the event that marked the end of the Yuan Dynasty?
8. What was the name of the lake built in Dadu by the Yuan Dynasty?
9. What was the name of the empire that the Yuan Dynasty was part of?
10. What was the name of the dynasty that preceded the Yuan Dynasty?

Now, I need to make sure the answers are accurate based on the given facts. Let me check the facts again. The capital is Dada, the leader is Toghon Temür, the battle is the Mongol conquest of the Song Dynasty, the successor is Ming, the calendar is "Time Granting Calendar", the event ending is the formation of the Northern Yuan, the lakes are Houhai and Qianhai, the empire is the Mongol Empire, and the predecessor is the Song Dynasty.

Wait, in the facts, the capital is Dada, but the answer might be "Dadu" as in the example. Also, the calendar is "Time Granting Calendar" (Time Granting Calendar). The lakes are Houhai and Qianhai. The event ending is the formation of the Northern Yuan. The empire is the Mongol Empire. Predecessor is the Song Dynasty.

So, I can structure the questions and answers accordingly. Let me make sure each question is unique and based on the facts provided.
