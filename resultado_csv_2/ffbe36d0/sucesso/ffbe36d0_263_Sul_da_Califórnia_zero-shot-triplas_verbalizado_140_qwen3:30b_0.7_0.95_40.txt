Okay, I need to generate 10 pairs of questions and answers based on the given context and facts. Let me start by understanding the requirements. The user wants exactly 10 pairs, each with a question and a correct answer in Portuguese. The questions must be varied, cover different aspects of the content, and the answers must be explicitly or inferentially from the provided data. No repetition of similar questions.

First, I'll go through the context. Southern California (SoCal) is the southern part of California with no exact boundaries, bordered by the Pacific Ocean, Mexico, and Arizona. The population in 2019 was about 23.8 million. Then there are a bunch of facts listed, like various companies, locations, people, events, etc.

I need to create questions that ask about different aspects. Let me think of possible angles: geography, population, notable places, companies, people, events, images, etc.

For example, one question could be about the population in 2019. The context states that in 2019, the population was approximately 23.8 million. So the answer would be that number.

Another question could be about the area in square miles. The facts mention "Southern California possui área total (mi²) 56505". So the answer is 56505.

Then, the borders: the context says it's bordered by the Pacific Ocean, Mexico, and Arizona. So the question could be about the borders, and the answer would list those.

Another fact is that the population was registered in 2020. So a question about when the population was registered would have 2020 as the answer.

There's a mention of the image "Sdmarina.jpg" and "Yucca Valley California 2017.jpg" and others. So a question about the representative image could be answered with one of those, but I need to pick one. For example, "Southern California possui imagem representativa Sdmarina.jpg" – so the answer could be Sdmarina.jpg.

Another fact is that the Southern California uses the model "Template:California". So a question about the wiki model would have that answer.

There's a fact about the subdivision "San Luis Obispo County, California" and others like San Bernardino County, Orange County, etc. So a question about subdivisions could ask for one of them.

The facts also mention people born there, like Jill Barnett, Neal Rubin, etc. So a question could be about a person born in SoCal, and the answer would be one of those names.

Events like the 1987 Whittier Narrows earthquake or the 2008 Chino Hills earthquake. A question could ask about an earthquake affecting SoCal, and the answer would be the name of the earthquake.

Also, there are companies and organizations present there, like USC Trojans men's rugby, Metrolink, etc. A question could ask about a sports team or a transportation system in SoCal.

I need to make sure each question is unique and covers different aspects. Let me list possible questions:

1. What is the population of Southern California in 2019?
2. What is the total area of Southern California in square miles?
3. Which are the natural borders of Southern California?
4. In which year was the population of Southern California registered?
5. What is a representative image of Southern California?
6. What wiki template does Southern California use?
7. Name a county that is a subdivision of Southern California.
8. Who is a person born in Southern California?
9. What earthquake affected Southern California in 1987?
10. What is a sports team based in Southern California?

Now, check the facts to ensure the answers are correct. For example, the population in 2019 is 23.8 million. The area is 56505 mi². The borders are Pacific Ocean, Mexico, Arizona. The population was registered in 2020 (from "Southern California população registrada em 2020"). A representative image is Sdmarina.jpg. The wiki template is Template:California. A subdivision could be San Luis Obispo County. A person born there is Jill Barnett. The 1987 earthquake is Whittier Narrows. A sports team is USC Trojans men's rugby.

I need to make sure each answer is directly from the facts. Let me verify each:

1. Population 2019: Yes, "população, em 2019, era de aproximadamente de 23,8 milhões de pessoas."
2. Area: "área total (mi²) 56505"
3. Borders: "No oeste está o Oceano Pacífico; ao sul, a fronteira internacional dos Estados Unidos com o México; e a leste está o estado do Arizona."
4. Population registered in 2020: "Southern California população registrada em 2020"
5. Image: "Southern California possui imagem representativa Sdmarina.jpg"
6. Wiki template: "Southern California usa modelo de página wiki Template:California"
7. Subdivision: "subdivisão San Luis Obispo County, California"
8. Person born: "Jill Barnett nasceu em Southern California"
9. Earthquake: "1987 Whittier Narrows earthquake afeta os países Southern California"
10. Sports team: "USC Trojans men's rugby pertence à região Southern California"

Yes, all these are directly from the facts. Now, I need to phrase the questions in Portuguese, making sure they are clear and varied. Also, ensure that the answers are exact as per the facts. Avoid repetition. Now, format them into the JSON structure as specified.
