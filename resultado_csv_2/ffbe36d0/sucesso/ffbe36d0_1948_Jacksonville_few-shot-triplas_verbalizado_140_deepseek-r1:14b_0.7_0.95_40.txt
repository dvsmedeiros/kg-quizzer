Okay, I need to generate exactly 10 pairs of questions and answers based on the provided context about Jacksonville, Florida. Each pair should have one question and one correct answer, all in Portuguese. The questions must be varied and cover different aspects of the content. Also, I shouldn't repeat similar questions or add any extra information beyond what's given.

First, I'll review the context to identify key points:

1. Jacksonville is the most populous city in Florida.
2. It's located in Duval County and was founded in 1791, incorporated in 1832.
3. Population around 950k as per the 2020 census.
4. Situated on the St. Johns River, near Georgia border and about 528 km north of Miami.
5. Historical aspects: Fort Caroline (1564), named after Andrew Jackson.
6. Hosted Super Bowl XLIX in 2005.
7. Various people born or died there, including athletes, authors, etc.
8. Several organizations and structures located there, like the University of Florida College of Pharmacy, KBJ Architects, Port of Jacksonville, etc.

Looking at the facts provided, many are about individuals and teams associated with Jacksonville, but I should focus on creating diverse questions from different areas: demographics, geography, history, sports, culture, etc.

I'll start brainstorming possible questions:

1. What is Jacksonville's population rank in the US? (From context: 12th)
2. Which river flows through Jacksonville? (St. Johns)
3. When was Jacksonville founded? (1791)
4. Name of the historical French colony there? (Fort Caroline)
5. Who is the famous person after whom the city is named? (Andrew Jackson)
6. What's Jacksonville's nickname? ("Jax," "The River City," etc.)
7. How far is Miami from Jacksonville? (528 km)
8. Which Super Bowl was hosted in Jacksonville? (XLIX in 2005)
9. Name a well-known musician from Jacksonville? (Lynyrd Skynyrd)
10. What's the population density of Jacksonville? (490.63 per km²)

Wait, I should cross-check these facts with the context provided to ensure accuracy.

From the context:
- Population rank: 12th.
- River: St. Johns.
- Founded in 1791.
- Fort Caroline established in 1564.
- Named after Andrew Jackson, the first military governor of Florida and future president.
- Nickname: "Jax," "The River City," "The Bold New City of the South."
- Distance from Miami: 528 km north.
- Super Bowl XLIX in 2005 at EverBank Field.
- Musicians: Lynyrd Skynyrd is mentioned as originating from Jacksonville.

I think these points can form solid questions. Now, I'll structure them into questions and answers.
