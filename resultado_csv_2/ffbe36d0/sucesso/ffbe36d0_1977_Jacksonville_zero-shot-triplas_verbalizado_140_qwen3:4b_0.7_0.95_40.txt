Okay, I need to generate 10 pairs of questions and answers based on the provided context and facts about Jacksonville, Florida. Let me start by understanding the context given.

The context mentions that Jacksonville is the most populous city in Florida, located in Duval County, and the third most populous on the East Coast after New York and Philadelphia. It was founded in 1791, incorporated in 1832, and has a population of nearly 950,000 as of the 2020 census. It's situated along the St. Johns River, 40 km south of Georgia's border, and 528 km north of Miami. The area was originally inhabited by the Timucua people and had a French colony called Fort Caroline in 1564. Under British rule, a settlement grew at the narrow point of the river, known as Wacca Pilatka. The city was established in 1822 after the U.S. gained Florida from Spain, named after Andrew Jackson. The 39th Super Bowl was held there in 2005.

Now, the facts provided include various events, teams, places, and people associated with Jacksonville. For example, the 2015 Fort Lauderdale Strikers season is based in Jacksonville, Double or Nothing (2020) is located there, 95 South has its origin in Jacksonville, the SS Harald Torsvik was built there, Florida State Road 104 has an interchange in Jacksonville, and so on. There are also mentions of people born or died in Jacksonville, like Butch Trucks and Keith Johns, and various sports teams and events using Jacksonville as their location.

I need to create 10 distinct questions that cover different aspects of this information. The questions should be based on the facts provided, not the general context given. Let me go through the facts and see which ones can be turned into questions.

First, the city's population: "Jacksonville, Florida possui população metropolitana 1733937" – so a question could be about the metropolitan population. Then, the city's nickname: "Jacksonville, Florida possui apelido 'Jax', 'The River City', The Bold New City of the South" – a question about its nicknames. The 39th Super Bowl in 2005 is a fact, so a question about that. The city's founding year, 1791, is another point. The location of the Super Bowl in the EverBank Field. The city's position in the population ranking, 12th in the US. The St. Johns River's location. The fact that it's along the Atlantic coast. The original inhabitants, Timucua. The Fort Caroline in 1564. The city's incorporation date, 1832. The city's location relative to Georgia and Miami. The fact that it's the most populous in Florida. The city's image representatives, like LennyCurryJAX.jpg and KingsleyPlantationSunset2.jpg. The presence of certain sports teams or events in Jacksonville, such as the 2015 Fort Lauderdale Strikers season.

I need to make sure the questions are varied and not repeating the same aspects. Let me list possible questions:

1. What is the population of Jacksonville, Florida according to the 2020 census?
2. What is the nickname of Jacksonville, Florida?
3. In which year was the 39th Super Bowl held in Jacksonville?
4. When was Jacksonville, Florida incorporated?
5. What is the name of the stadium where the 39th Super Bowl was held?
6. What is the position of Jacksonville, Florida in the national population ranking?
7. Which river is Jacksonville located along?
8. What is the name of the original inhabitants of the area that is now Jacksonville?
9. Which historical event took place in Jacksonville in 1564?
10. What is the distance from Jacksonville to the Georgia border?

Now, I need to check if these questions are based on the provided facts. Let me verify:

1. The 2020 census population is mentioned as "quase 950 mil habitantes" but the fact says "população metropolitana 1733937". Wait, the context says "com uma população de quase 950 mil habitantes, de acordo com o censo nacional de 2020." So the question could be about the total population, but the fact says the metropolitan population is 1.7 million. However, the user's instruction says to use the facts provided. So I need to check which fact to use. The context says "população de quase 950 mil habitantes" (approx 950k), but the fact says "população metropolitana 1733937". So maybe the question should be about the metropolitan population. But the user's instruction says to generate questions based on the provided facts. So the fact "Jacksonville, Florida possui população metropolitana 1733937" is correct. So the question could be about the metropolitan population.

2. The nicknames are listed in the context: "apelido 'Jax', 'The River City', The Bold New City of the South".

3. The 39th Super Bowl in 2005 is mentioned in the context: "A 6 de fevereiro de 2005 realizou-se XXXIX Super Bowl no EverBank Field."

4. The incorporation date is 1832, as per the context.

5. The stadium is EverBank Field, as per the context.

6. The position in the national ranking is 12th, as per the context.

7. The St. Johns River is mentioned in the context.

8. The original inhabitants are the Timucua, as per the context.

9. The historical event in 1564 is Fort Caroline, as per the context.

10. The distance to Georgia's border is 40 km, as per the context.

Now, I need to make sure that the questions are based on the facts, not the general context. For example, the fact that the 2015 Fort Lauderdale Strikers season is based in Jacksonville is a fact, but the question about the Super Bowl is based on the context. Wait, the context says "A 6 de fevereiro de 2005 realizou-se XXXIX Super Bowl no EverBank Field." So the answer is 2005. The fact about the 39th Super Bowl is in the context, so that's correct.

So, I can proceed to create the 10 questions based on these points. Let me check if all these points are covered in the facts. Yes, the facts include the population, nicknames, Super Bowl year, incorporation date, stadium name, population ranking, river, original inhabitants, historical event, and distance to Georgia. That's 10 points. So the 10 questions can be based on these.
