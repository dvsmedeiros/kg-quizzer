Okay, I need to generate 10 objective question-answer pairs based on the provided context and facts about Islamism. Let me start by understanding the context given.

The context explains that Islamism is a political-religious ideology aiming to implement Sharia law, promote a pan-Islamic unity, establish Islamic states, and reject non-Muslim influences, especially Western ones. The facts list various organizations, parties, and individuals associated with Islamism, including their names and some related topics.

First, I should identify key aspects of Islamism from the context. The main points are: implementation of Sharia, pan-Islamic unity, creation of Islamic states, rejection of non-Muslim influences, and the association with specific groups and parties.

Now, I need to create questions that cover these aspects without repeating similar ones. Let me think of different angles. For example, what is the main goal of Islamism? What does it emphasize in governance? How does it view non-Muslim influences? What are some examples of organizations associated with Islamism?

Looking at the facts, there are many organizations listed. I can ask about specific groups, but the user might want general questions. Also, the examples given in the sample include questions about the origin of Hamas, the objective of groups like Hezbollah and Hamas, and the rejection of democracy by radicals.

I should ensure that each question is unique and covers different aspects. Let me list possible questions:

1. What is the primary goal of the islamism ideology?
2. What does islamism emphasize in the context of governance?
3. Which aspect of society does islamism aim to restructure?
4. What is the main focus of islamism in terms of political unity?
5. What are some examples of organizations associated with islamism?
6. What does islamism seek to establish in political terms?
7. What is the main idea behind the rejection of non-Muslim influences?
8. What is the role of the xaria in islamism?
9. What is the main objective of groups like the Hamas and Hezbollah?
10. What is the basis of the radical Islamic organizations' actions?

Now, I need to check if these questions are covered in the context and facts. The first question can be about the primary goal, which is mentioned in the context as implementing Sharia, pan-Islamic unity, and creating Islamic states. The second question about governance would relate to the implementation of Sharia. The third question about restructuring society is covered in the context. The fourth question about political unity is also in the context. The fifth question about examples can use the list of organizations from the facts. The sixth question about political establishment is mentioned. The seventh question about rejecting non-Muslim influences is in the context. The eighth question about xaria is directly mentioned. The ninth question about Hamas and Hezbollah's objective is in the context. The tenth question about the basis of radical actions is also covered.

I need to make sure that the answers are correct and derived from the context. Also, the examples in the facts can be used to answer some questions, but the user wants the answers to be explicit or inferable from the content. For example, the answer to the question about examples can be "Nahdlatul Ulama, Al-Qaeda, and Hamas" as they are listed in the facts.

Let me structure the questions and answers accordingly, ensuring they are in Portuguese and follow the required format.
