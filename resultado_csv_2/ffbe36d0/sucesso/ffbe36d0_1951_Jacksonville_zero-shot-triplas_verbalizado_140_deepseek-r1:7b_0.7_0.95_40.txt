Okay, I need to generate 10 pairs of questions and answers based on the provided context about Jacksonville, Florida. The user has given me a lot of detailed information, so I'll need to extract key facts to formulate these questions.

First, I'll go through each fact one by one and identify what can be turned into a question with a clear answer.

1. **Population**: Jacksonville has nearly 950,000 people. So, I can ask about the population.
2. **Location**: It's in Duval County, Florida, so that's straightforward.
3. **Fund date**: Founded in 1791 and incorporated in 1832. Maybe combine into a single question about when it was founded.
4. **River proximity**: Near St. Johns River, approximately 40 km from Georgia and 528 km from Miami. I can create two questions here.
5. **Communities on the beach**: Jacksonville Beaches are along the atlantic coast near Miami. That's a good question about the location of these communities.
6. **Pueblo indgenio**: Original inhabitants were Timucua, and later Spanish settlers came. So, I can ask about the original Native American population.
7. **Frances colony**: Fort Caroline was established in 1564 under France. That's a specific fact that can be turned into a question about the first European settlement.
8. **Andrew Jackson connection**:Jacksonville was named after Andrew Jackson, who was both a governor and president. A question about this historical aspect makes sense.
9. **Super Bowl venue**: Jacksonville was the location of the 2005 XXXIX Super Bowl. That's a specific event tied to the city.
10. **Baseball players**: Several notable players like Butch Trucks, Keith Johns, Chris Hayes have been born in Jacksonville. I can create multiple questions about this.

Now, making sure each question is unique and ties directly to the context without being repetitive. Each answer should be exact or clearly derivable from the provided facts.
