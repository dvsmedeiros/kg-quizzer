Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to generate 10 question-answer pairs based on the provided context and facts about civil disobedience. First, I need to understand the context thoroughly. The main points are that civil disobedience is a nonviolent protest against unjust laws or oppressive governments, originated by Henry David Thoreau, used by Gandhi and Martin Luther King, and examples include various protests like the End SARS memorial, 2021 Montenegrin protests, and others.

Now, the facts section lists a bunch of events and organizations that used civil disobedience. I need to make sure the questions are varied and cover different aspects. Let me check the examples given to see the structure. The examples include questions about definitions, historical examples, key figures, and specific movements.

I need to avoid repeating similar questions. Let me list possible angles: definition, key figures (Thoreau, Gandhi, MLK), historical events (like the Indian independence, US civil rights movement), specific protests mentioned in the facts (End SARS, 2021 Montenegrin protests, etc.), categories or classifications (like nonviolence, activism types), and maybe the methods used (wiki templates, categories, etc.).

Wait, some of the facts mention specific wiki templates and categories, but the user's examples don't include those. Maybe focus more on the core aspects. Also, the user's examples have answers like "esobediência civil" (which is Portuguese for civil disobedience), so the answers should be in Portuguese.

Let me start drafting questions. First, a definition question. Then, who are the key figures. Then, examples of movements. Then, the originators. Also, mention specific events like the Gwangju Uprising or the Assam Movement. Check for uniqueness. Avoid asking about the same event multiple times. Make sure each question is distinct. Also, ensure answers are correct based on the context and facts provided.

Wait, the answer examples sometimes have incomplete answers like "apartheid," but the user's examples might have typos. Need to be precise. For example, the Assam Movement is mentioned in the facts, so a question about that would have that as the answer. Similarly, the 2021 End SARS memorial protest is listed, so a question about that event would have that as the answer.

Also, the context mentions that civil disobedience is a form of protest against unjust laws or oppressive governments. So a question about the purpose or reason for using civil disobedience could be asked, with the answer being "contra leis injustas ou governos opressores."

Another angle: the methods used, like nonviolent resistance. But the examples given by the user include answers like "resistência não violentos," so maybe that's a valid question.

Now, compiling 10 questions. Let me check the facts again for specific events and people. For example, the Kenosha unrest, Women Disobey, Sisters Uncut, etc. Also, the context mentions Henry David Thoreau and Gandhi. So questions could be about who coined the term, who applied it, etc.

Let me structure the questions:

1. What is the term for peaceful protest against unjust laws? (Answer: desobediência civil)
2. Who is considered the originator of civil disobedience? (Answer: Henry David Thoreau)
3. Which movement used civil disobedience for independence? (Answer: Indian independence movement)
4. Which U.S. movement used civil disobedience? (Answer: Civil rights movement)
5. What event used civil disobedience in 2021? (Answer: End SARS memorial protest)
6. Which group is associated with civil disobedience? (Answer: Sisters Uncut)
7. What is the purpose of civil disobedience? (Answer: resistência contra leis injustas)
8. What is an example of civil disobedience in 2020? (Answer: George Floyd protests in Chicago)
9. Which country's protests used civil disobedience in 2021? (Answer: Montenegro)
10. What is another name for civil disobedience? (Answer: Refusal)

Wait, the answer for question 10 in the example is "Refusal," which is the hypernym mentioned in the facts. Need to check if that's correct. The context says "Civil disobedience possui hiperônimo Refusal," so yes.

Now, translating these into Portuguese, ensuring the answers are accurate and match the context. Also, making sure the questions are varied and not repetitive.
