Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs based on the provided context and facts. Let me start by reading through the context and facts carefully.

The context talks about the Scottish Parliament, its history, structure, and elections. The facts include various details like the location (Edinburgh), the number of members (129), the election system (mixed proportional representation), the 1998 Act, and the current Presiding Officer. The facts also mention specific constituencies, commissions, and other related entities.

First, I should identify key points from the context. The Scottish Parliament is unicameral, located in Edinburgh, has 129 MSPs, was established by the 1998 Act, and the last election was in 2016. The previous parliament was merged with the English one in 1707 to form the UK Parliament. The current one started in 1999, and the Presiding Officer is mentioned, though their name isn't in the context.

Looking at the facts, there's a lot of information about specific constituencies, commissions (like Economy, Energy and Tourism), the next election on 05-07, and the current Presiding Officer is Alison Johnstone. Also, there's mention of the Scottish Parliament Building in Edinburgh, the type of legislature, and the use of certain Wikipedia templates.

Now, I need to create varied questions that cover different aspects. Let me brainstorm possible questions:

1. Where is the Scottish Parliament located?
2. What is the total number of members in the Scottish Parliament?
3. When was the current Scottish Parliament established?
4. What is the electoral system used for elections?
5. Which act led to the creation of the Scottish Parliament?
6. What is the name of the current Presiding Officer?
7. When was the last general election held?
8. How many members are elected through geographical constituencies?
9. What is the name of the building where the Scottish Parliament meets?
10. Which regions are part of the Scottish Parliament's electoral system?

Now, checking the facts and context for correct answers. The location is Edinburgh. Total members are 129. Established in 1999. Electoral system is mixed proportional representation (73 geographic, 52 regional). The 1998 Act. Current Presiding Officer is Alison Johnstone (from the facts). Last election was 2016. 73 members from geographic constituencies. Building is Scottish Parliament Building. Electoral regions include the eight regions mentioned.

I need to make sure that each question is unique and covers different aspects. Also, ensure answers are directly from the provided info. Let me structure each pair accordingly.
