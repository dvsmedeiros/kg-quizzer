Okay, I need to generate 10 objective questions and answers based on the provided context and facts about Fresno, California. Let me start by reviewing the context and the list of facts given.

The context states that Fresno is the fifth most populous city in California, located in Fresno County, founded in 1872, incorporated on October 12, 1885, and has a population over 542,000 as of the 2020 census, making it the 34th largest city in the US.

The facts include various people born or died in Fresno, radio stations with transmission areas in Fresno, sports teams based there, and other geographical and administrative details. For example, Fresno has a mayor-council government, a ZIP code 93720, a geographic coordinate (36.75, -119.76666666666667), an area of 300.438620798976 square miles, and a website template.

I need to create questions that are varied and cover different aspects. Let me think of possible topics: population ranking, incorporation date, geographic coordinates, ZIP code, government structure, sports teams, radio stations, historical facts, and maybe some about the city's name or other notable facts.

Wait, the example questions include things like the meaning of the name, pronunciation, historical events, and specific details. But the user's context doesn't mention the name's meaning in Spanish, so maybe that's not applicable. However, the example includes that, but the context here doesn't state that. The context says "Fresno" is a city in California, but not its meaning. So maybe that's not a valid question.

But the example has a question about the name's meaning in Spanish, but the context here doesn't mention that. So I need to avoid that. So I should focus on the facts provided.

Looking at the facts, I can create questions about:

- The year Fresno was incorporated.
- The population rank in the US (34th).
- The geographic coordinates.
- The ZIP code.
- The type of government (Strong Mayor).
- Radio stations with transmission in Fresno.
- Sports teams based in Fresno.
- The area of the city in square miles.
- The census year (2020).
- The city's status as a county seat.
- The year the city was founded.
- The number of people in the 2020 census.

But the example includes questions about the name meaning and pronunciation, but the context here doesn't mention that. So I need to stick to the given facts.

Let me check the facts again. The facts include that Fresno is the fifth largest in California, incorporated in 1885, population over 542k (34th in US), geographic coordinates, ZIP code 559, government type, radio stations, sports teams, area size, and other details.

So possible questions could be:

1. What is the name of the city that is the fifth most populous in California?
2. In which year was Fresno incorporated?
3. What is the population of Fresno according to the 2020 census?
4. What is the geographic coordinate of Fresno, California?
5. What is the ZIP code of Fresno, California?
6. What is the type of government of Fresno, California?
7. Which radio station has its transmission area in Fresno, California?
8. Which sports team is based in Fresno, California?
9. What is the area of Fresno, California in square miles?
10. What is the rank of Fresno in terms of population in the United States according to the 2020 census?

Wait, but the example has a question about the 2020 census, so that's valid. Also, the example has a question about the population rank in the US, but the context says it's the 34th. So that's a valid question.

But I need to make sure that each question is unique and based on the facts. Let me check the facts again to see if there are other possible questions.

Another fact: Fresno is the county seat of Fresno County. So a question about that.

Another fact: Fresno has a website template.

Also, the example includes a question about the number of bondes in 1931, but that's not in the given facts. So I need to avoid that.

So possible questions:

1. What is the rank of Fresno in terms of population in the United States according to the 2020 census?
2. In which year was Fresno incorporated?
3. What is the geographic coordinate of Fresno, California?
4. What is the ZIP code of Fresno, California?
5. What is the type of government of Fresno, California?
6. Which radio station has its transmission area in Fresno, California?
7. Which sports team is based in Fresno, California?
8. What is the area of Fresno, California in square miles?
9. What is the county seat of Fresno County?
10. What is the year in which Fresno was founded?

But the user's context says it was founded in 1872, so that's a valid question.

But in the example, the user included a question about the year the city was incorporated, which is 1885. So that's covered.

So I need to make sure the questions are based on the facts provided. Let me check the facts again.

Yes, the context says: founded in 1872, incorporated in 1885, population over 542k (34th in US), geographic coordinates, ZIP code 559, government type, radio stations, sports teams, area size.

So I can create 10 questions from these points. Let me make sure each question is unique and not overlapping.

For example:

- What is the rank of Fresno in terms of population in the United States according to the 2020 census?
- In which year was Fresno incorporated?
- What is the geographic coordinate of Fresno, California?
- What is the ZIP code of Fresno, California?
- What is the type of government of Fresno, California?
- Which radio station has its transmission area in Fresno, California?
- Which sports team is based in Fresno, California?
- What is the area of Fresno, California in square miles?
- What is the county seat of Fresno County?
- What is the year in which Fresno was founded?

That's 10 questions. Now, I need to make sure that the answers are correct based on the given facts. Let me check each:

1. The 2020 census says it's the 34th largest in the US. Correct.
2. Incorporated in 1885. Correct.
3. Geographic coordinates (36.75, -119.76666666666667). Correct.
4. ZIP code is 93720. Wait, the context says "ZIP code 559" but that's probably a mistake. Wait, the context says "ZIP code 559" but that's not correct. Wait, looking back at the facts:

Wait, in the facts, the user wrote: "Fresno, California possui imagem representativa Fresno station 2434 35 (cropped2).jpg" but that's not relevant. Wait, the facts include "ZIP code 559" but that's not correct. Wait, in the context, the user says "ZIP code 559"? Let me check again.

Looking at the facts, the user wrote: "Fresno, California possui ZIP code 559,..." but that's not correct. The actual ZIP code for Fresno is 93720. But in the given facts, maybe there's a mistake. Wait, the user provided the facts, but in the example, the user included a question about the ZIP code, but the context here says "ZIP code 559". However, that's likely a mistake. Because the correct ZIP code for Fresno is 93720. However, the user's facts may have that. So, the answer would be 559 according to the provided facts, even if it's incorrect. But the user is asking to generate questions based on the given facts, not real-world knowledge. So I need to use the facts as given.

Wait, in the user's facts, there's a line: "Fresno, California possui ZIP code 559,..." but that's probably incorrect. But the user says to generate based on the facts provided, even if they are wrong. So I need to use the given facts. But in the example, the user had a question about the ZIP code being 93720. But in the given facts here, the user may have a different ZIP code. Wait, I need to check again.

Looking back at the user's facts, the user wrote: "Fresno, California possui ZIP code 559,..." but that's not correct. However, the user may have made a mistake in the facts, but I have to use the facts as given. So in the user's facts, the ZIP code is 559. But that's not correct. However, the user's instruction says to generate questions based on the given facts, not real knowledge. So I need to take that as given.

But in the example, the user had a question about the ZIP code being 93720, but that's not in the given facts. So I need to check the user's facts again.

Wait, the user's facts include: "Fresno, California possui ZIP code 559,..." but that's not accurate. However, the user may have a mistake. But since the user provided that, I have to use it. But I need to confirm.

Alternatively, maybe the user made a mistake in the facts. But the user is the one providing the facts, so I need to take them as correct for the purpose of the question.

So, the answer for ZIP code would be 559, even if it's incorrect. So the question would be: "What is the ZIP code of Fresno, California?"

But that's a problem. However, the user's example includes a question about the ZIP code being 93720, but in the given facts, the user says it's 559. So I need to proceed with the given facts.

So the answer would be 559. But that's not correct. However, the user's facts may have that. So the question is based on that.

Similarly, the geographic coordinate is (36.75, -119.76666666666667), which is correct.

So, the 10 questions would be as follows:

1. What is the rank of Fresno in terms of population in the United States according to the 2020 census?
2. In which year was Fresno incorporated?
3. What is the geographic coordinate of Fresno, California?
4. What is the ZIP code of Fresno, California?
5. What is the type of government of Fresno, California?
6. Which radio station has its transmission area in Fresno, California?
7. Which sports team is based in Fresno, California?
8. What is the area of Fresno, California in square miles?
9. What is the county seat of Fresno County?
10. What is the year in which Fresno was founded?

Now, I need to make sure that each of these questions is answerable with the given facts. Let me check each:

1. The 2020 census says it's the 34th largest in the US. Correct.
2. Incorporated in 1885. Correct.
3. Coordinates given. Correct.
4. ZIP code 559. Correct based on given facts.
5. Strong Mayor. Correct.
6. Radio stations: KSKS, KFTV-DT, K17JI-D, etc. But the user's facts mention several radio stations, so the answer could be any of them, but the question is "which radio station..." but the answer is one of them. However, the user's example includes a question about a specific radio station, but the answer is not unique. So maybe the question is "Which radio station has its transmission area in Fresno, California?" and the answer is "KSKS". But the user's facts have multiple, so maybe the answer is "KSKS" or "KFTV-DT", etc. But the user's example has a question about a specific one, but the answer is not unique. However, the user's example includes a question about "KSKS", so that's acceptable.

7. Sports teams: Fresno Monsters, Fresno Open, etc. But the user's facts include "Fresno Monsters", "Fresno Open", "Fresno County Courthouse", "Kearney–Baker Stadium", etc. But the user's example includes a question about a sports team, so the answer could be "Fresno Monsters" or "Fresno Open", but the answer is a team. So "Fresno Monsters" is a team. So the answer is "Fresno Monsters".

8. Area is 300.438620798976 square miles. Correct.

9. County seat of Fresno County is Fresno. Correct.

10. Founded in 1872. Correct.

So these 10 questions should be valid based on the given facts.
