Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs based on the provided context and facts. Let me start by understanding the content thoroughly.

The context explains that an empire is a large political entity governed by a sovereign or oligarchy, often through conquest. It mentions the term "Imperium" from Latin, and examples like the Roman Empire. The facts provided are in RDF format, listing various entities related to imperialism, such as political parties, books, genocides, and scholars associated with the concept.

First, I should focus on the main points from the context: definition of an empire, its structure, the Latin origin of the term, examples like the Roman Empire, and the categorization as a political concept. Then, the facts include associations with different ideologies, motives, subjects, and disciplines related to imperialism.

I need to create diverse questions covering different aspects. Let me brainstorm possible questions:

1. Origin of the term "imperialism" – Latin.
2. What is the primary characteristic of an empire? – Governed by a sovereign or oligarchy.
3. Example of an empire mentioned in the text – Roman Empire.
4. How is an empire typically formed? – Through conquest.
5. What does the term "imperialism" refer to in the context of political analysis? – A concept encompassing common characteristics.
6. Which Latin term is the basis for "imperialism"? – Imperium.
7. What is the central authority in an empire called? – The sovereign or emperor.
8. What is the role of the metropolis in an empire? – Exercising political control over peripheries.
9. Which historical event is associated with imperialism as a motive? – Circassian genocide.
10. What does the term "imperialism" encompass in terms of political systems? – A category of analysis involving central and peripheral regions.

Now, I need to ensure each question is unique and covers different aspects. Let me check the examples provided to avoid repetition. The examples include questions about the origin of the term, how it's administered, types of imperialism, etc. I should make sure not to repeat these.

Wait, the example questions have answers like "latina" for the origin, "força militar" for administration, etc. I should align with the context and facts. Let me structure the questions to cover definitions, examples, related concepts, and specific facts from the RDF data.

Also, the facts mention various entities like the Canadian Party, genocides, books, and scholars. Maybe include questions about these, like which book is related to imperialism or which party associated with it. However, the user might prefer questions more directly related to the definition and examples provided in the context.

I need to balance between the general definition and specific facts. Let me proceed step by step, ensuring each question is distinct and answers are derived from the context and facts.

Now, compiling the 10 pairs, making sure they are varied and accurate based on the provided information.
