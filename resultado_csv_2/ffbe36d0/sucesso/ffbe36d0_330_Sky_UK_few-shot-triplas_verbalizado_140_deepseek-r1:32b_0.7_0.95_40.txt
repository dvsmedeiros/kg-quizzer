Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs based on the provided context and facts about British Satellite Broadcasting (BSB). Let me start by carefully reading through all the information given.

First, the company was founded in December 1986 and started broadcasting in March 1990. It merged with Sky Television in November 1990 to form BSkyB. The headquarters were located at London and Marco Polo House. BSB owned several TV channels like Galaxy, The Power Station, Now, and The Movie Channel.

I should make sure each question is unique and covers different aspects of the context. Let me list out key points:

1. Founding date: December 1986
2. Start of broadcasting: March 1990
3. Merger with Sky Television in 1990 to form BSkyB
4. Headquarters location: London, specifically Marco Polo House
5. Ownership of TV channels like Galaxy and The Power Station
6. Successor company after merger: Sky UK

Now, I'll create varied questions from these points.

For example:
- When was BSB founded?
- When did it start broadcasting?
- Which company did it merge with?
- What's the name of the merged company?
- Where were they based?

I need to make sure each question has a clear answer directly from the facts. Also, avoid similar questions and cover different aspects.

Let me draft 10 pairs ensuring each is distinct and covers various details about BSB.
