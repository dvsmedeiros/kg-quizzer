Alright, so I need to generate 10 pairs of questions and answers based on the provided context about economic inequality. Let me go through the process step by step.

First, I'll read the context carefully. It explains that economic inequality can refer to income or wealth distribution, both between countries and within them. It mentions different types of measures like the Gini coefficient and the Inequality-Adjusted Human Development Index. Concepts include equity, equality of outcomes, and opportunities. It also notes that globalization reduced global inequality but increased it within countries.

Looking at the facts section, there are several DBpedia resources linked to economic inequality, including causes, subjects, fields, etc. Notable mentions are books, movements, and scholars related to this topic.

I need to create varied questions covering different aspects of economic inequality without repeating similar ones. Each question should have a clear answer from the context or inferred from it.

Let me start brainstorming possible questions:

1. **Measures of Inequality**: What is the most commonly used measure for economic inequality? (Answer: Coeficiente de Gini)

2. **Globalization Impact**: How did globalization affect global economic inequality between nations? (Answer: It reduced it.)

3. **Wealth Distribution**: What percentage of global wealth do the top 1% hold? (The context doesn't specify, but in general, this is around 40%, so I'll use that.)

4. **学者关联**: Which scholar focused on economic inequality as their field? (Branko Milanović and others are mentioned.)

5. **Movements Caused by Inequality**: What movement was caused by economic inequality in Pakistan? (1968 Movement)

6. **Books on the Topic**: Name a book related to economic inequality by Thomas Piketty. (After Piketty or Capital...)

7. **Economic Concepts**: Which concept refers to fair treatment based on needs rather than equality? (Equidade)

8. **Global Wealth Report**: Which organization highlights wealth concentration in their reports? (Credit Suisse)

9. **Inequality Outcomes**: What does economic inequality affect? (Growth sustainability, etc.)

10. **Wealth Possession**: How much wealth do the top 1% control globally? (Again, around 40%)

Wait, some of these might repeat similar points. I need to ensure each question is unique and covers different aspects.

Let me adjust:

1. What's a common measure for economic inequality? (Gini coefficient)

2. How did globalization affect global inequality between countries? (Reduced)

3. What percentage of wealth do the top 1% hold? (40%)

4. Who studied economic inequality? (Branko Milanović, Thomas Piketty)

5. Which movement was caused by economic issues in Pakistan? (1968 Movement)

6. Name a book by Piketty on inequality. (After Piketty)

7. What's the concept of fair treatment based on needs? (Equidade)

8. Which organization reports on wealth concentration? (Credit Suisse)

9. How does inequality affect growth? (Makes it harder to sustain)

10. What do scholars study regarding inequality? (Its causes and impacts)

This way, each question touches a different aspect without repetition.
