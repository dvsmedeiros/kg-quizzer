Okay, so I've got this query from a user who wants me to generate multiple-choice questions based on a given context. The context provided is "Sky_UK", but it's pretty brief. Hmm, maybe they expect me to know about Sky UK based on general knowledge.

First, I need to understand the structure they want. They specified a JSON format with exactly 10 question-answer pairs. Each pair should have a question in Portuguese and its corresponding correct answer. Also, each question must cover different aspects of the context without repeating similar questions.

I wonder what specific information about Sky UK is necessary. Sky UK is a major broadcaster, right? So topics could include when it was founded, who owns it, the number of channels, services they offer like sports or movies, their reach, competition, and key events like the Premier League rights.

Wait, let me make sure I don't miss any important details. The user mentioned that each question should have a single correct answer, so I need to ensure clarity in both questions and answers. Also, the questions should be varied to cover different facets of Sky UK's operations and history.

I'll start by listing possible questions: founding year, ownership, number of channels, services available, reach in the UK, competition with other broadcasters, investment areas, key sports rights like Premier League, impact on media landscape, and technological innovations like 4K or HDR.

Each of these points can form a unique question. Now, translating them into Portuguese accurately is crucial to avoid misunderstandings. I should double-check each translation for correctness and clarity.

Let me draft the first few questions:

1. When was Sky UK founded?
2. Who owns Sky UK?
3. How many channels does Sky offer?
4. What services do they provide besides TV?
5. How many UK homes do they reach?

Then continue with investment areas, sports coverage, media impact, technological features, and competition.

I need to ensure each answer is precise and directly tied to the context. For example, confirming that Sky UK was founded in 1990 and owned by Sky plc. Also, making sure the number of channels and services are accurate based on current information.

Wait, does Sky UK still own Sky News? Or have there been changes? I might need to verify that. Similarly, checking if they indeed invest 2 billion pounds annually in content.

Also, ensuring that the reach is correct—over 10 million homes sounds plausible but should be confirmed. Similarly, details about technological advancements like HDR and 4K should be accurate as of the latest information.

I think I've covered all the necessary points without repeating any. Now, structuring each into a question-answer pair in Portuguese, ensuring clarity and correctness.
