Alright, so I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs based on the provided context and facts about the Amazon rainforest. The goal is to make sure each question is unique, covers different aspects of the content, and has a correct answer that's directly supported by the information given.

First, I'll read through the context carefully to understand the key points. It mentions the Amazon's size, the countries it spans, its biodiversity, and some historical facts like UNESCO status and deforestation issues.

Looking at the facts section, there are a lot of images and categories, but the important data includes specific details like area coverage, country distribution, notable deaths in the region, protected areas, languages spoken, and economic aspects.

I should create questions that target different dimensions: geographical, environmental, historical, cultural, etc. For example, one question could ask about its nickname, another about its size, another about which countries it spans, and so on.

Let me start brainstorming potential questions:

1. What is the Amazon rainforest's nickname in English?
2. How much area does the Amazon cover in millions of km²?
3. Which country has the largest portion of the Amazon?
4. How many countries does the Amazon span?
5. What percentage of the world's tropical forests does it represent?
6. Name a significant protected area within the Amazon.
7. Which language family is spoken there?
8. Who are some notable individuals linked to the Amazon?
9. What economic activity is associated with the region?
10. What is the capital city of a major country in the Amazon?

Wait, but looking at the context, the capital cities aren't mentioned, so maybe that's not the best question. Instead, perhaps something about its biodiversity or deforestation.

I'll adjust the last one to focus on an economic activity instead. Let me make sure each answer is directly supported by the text.

Now, I'll structure these into proper questions and answers, ensuring clarity and correctness based on the provided information.
