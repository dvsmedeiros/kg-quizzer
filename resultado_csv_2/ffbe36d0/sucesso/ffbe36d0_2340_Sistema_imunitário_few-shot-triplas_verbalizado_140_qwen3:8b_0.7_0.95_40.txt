Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs based on the provided context and facts. Let me start by understanding the content thoroughly. The context talks about the immune system, its functions, components, and related terms. The facts list various elements like cells (e.g., Basophil, T cell, B cell), diseases (e.g., Sepsis, Food allergy), and other terms related to the immune system.

First, I'll identify key aspects from the context. The immune system protects against diseases, detects pathogens, has innate and adaptive mechanisms, involves memory immunology, and can lead to autoimmune issues or immunodeficiency. The facts mention specific cells (like granulocytes, lymphocytes, macrophages), diseases (sepsis, rheumatology), and some images and templates used in Wikipedia.

Now, I need to create diverse questions covering different aspects. Let's brainstorm possible questions:

1. What is the primary function of the immune system? (Answer: protect against diseases)
2. Who is considered the father of immunology? (Answer: Ilya Ilyich Mechnikov)
3. What are the two main types of immunity? (Answer: innate and adaptive)
4. What is the term for a hyperactive immune system attacking healthy tissue? (Answer: autoimmunity)
5. Which cells are part of the immune system? (Answer: T cells, B cells, etc.)
6. What is the result of an underactive immune system? (Answer: immunodeficiency)
7. What is the basis of vaccination? (Answer: acquired immunity)
8. Which disease is linked to the immune system as a cause? (Answer: sepsis, food allergy)
9. What process allows the immune system to remember pathogens? (Answer: memory immunology)
10. What is the role of phagocytosis in the immune system? (Answer: engulf and destroy pathogens)

Wait, the examples provided in the user's message have some answers that are not fully detailed, like "patógenos," but maybe that's acceptable. However, I need to ensure each answer is directly inferable from the context or facts. Let me check each point again.

For example, the context mentions that the immune system detects pathogens, so a question about that would have "patógenos" as the answer. The facts list various cells, so questions about which cells are part of the system can be formed. Also, the context states that immunodeficiency is when the system is less active, leading to recurrent infections. 

I should make sure not to repeat similar questions. For instance, asking about the two types of immunity and the two main subsystems might be similar. Let me adjust to cover different aspects. Also, the facts mention specific diseases like sepsis and food allergy, so questions about their causes can be included.

Another point is the mention of adaptive NK cells and other cells like dendritic cells. Including questions about these specific cells would be good. Also, the context mentions the role of memory immunology in vaccines, so that's a key point.

I need to ensure each question is unique and covers different aspects. Let me list out 10 questions now, making sure they are varied and answers are directly from the context or facts.
