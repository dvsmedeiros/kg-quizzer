Okay, the user wants me to generate 10 question-answer pairs in Portuguese based on the provided context and facts about civil disobedience. Let me start by understanding the context and the facts given.

The context explains that civil disobedience is a peaceful protest against unjust laws or oppressive governments, originating from Henry David Thoreau and used by Gandhi, MLK, etc. The facts list various instances where civil disobedience was used, like the 2021 Montenegrin protests, the 2017 Serbian protests, and so on. There are also mentions of different people, events, and organizations associated with it.

I need to make sure each question is unique and covers different aspects. The examples given in the user's message include questions about the definition, historical figures, examples of movements, and specific events. I should avoid repeating similar questions and ensure that each answer is directly derived from the context or the facts provided.

Let me start by creating questions about the definition. The user's example had a question about what civil disobedience is, so maybe I can ask that. Then, another question about its origin. The context mentions Henry David Thoreau, so that's a good point.

Next, I can ask about the use of civil disobedience in specific events, like the 2021 End SARS memorial protest. Also, the examples given in the facts include various countries and events. I need to make sure each question is distinct. For instance, asking about the use of civil disobedience in the 2017 Serbian protests, the 2020 Kyrgyz Revolution, and the 2021 Montenegrin protests. 

I should also include questions about the key figures, like Henry David Thoreau and Mahatma Gandhi. The facts mention that Thoreau had notable ideas in civil disobedience, so that's a good point. Also, the example of the Women Disobey movement using civil disobedience.

Another angle is the types of movements or events that use civil disobedience, like the National Campaign Against Fees and Cuts. Also, the use of civil disobedience in the 2019–2020 clerical protests in Montenegro. 

I need to check that each answer is directly from the facts. For example, the fact says "Refuse Fascism utiliza os métodos Civil disobedience," so a question about that. Also, the fact mentions that civil disobedience has a category in Wikipedia, so that's another point.

Wait, the user's example had a question about the movement in South Africa, but the context here doesn't mention South Africa. However, the facts do mention the 2021 End SARS memorial protest, which is in Nigeria. Maybe I can use that. Also, the 2022 Kazakh unrest, the 2019–2020 clerical protests in Montenegro, and the 2017 St. Louis protests. 

I need to ensure that each of the 10 questions is unique and covers different aspects. Let me list out possible questions:

1. Definition of civil disobedience.
2. Originator of the concept.
3. Historical figure associated with it.
4. Use in the 2021 End SARS memorial protest.
5. Use in the 2017 Serbian protests.
6. Use in the 2020 Kyrgyz Revolution.
7. Use in the 2021 Montenegrin protests.
8. Use in the Women Disobey movement.
9. Use in the National Campaign Against Fees and Cuts.
10. Use in the 2019–2020 clerical protests in Montenegro.

I need to check if these are all covered in the facts. The facts do mention all these events. Also, the answer to the first question is "desobediência civil," as per the example. The origin is Henry David Thoreau, and the key figures include Gandhi and MLK. 

I should also make sure that the answers are in Portuguese and directly from the context. For example, the fact says "Civil disobedience usa modelo de página wiki Template:Cite book," but that's not relevant to the question. The answer should be based on the facts provided. 

Another thing: the user's example had a question about the movement in South Africa, but the context here doesn't mention that. However, the facts do mention the 2021 End SARS memorial protest, which is in Nigeria. So that's a valid example. 

I think I have enough varied questions now. Let me structure them into JSON format as per the instructions, making sure each pair is unique and the answers are correct.
