Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs based on the provided context about the IPCC. Let me start by reading through the context carefully to understand all the key points. The context mentions the IPCC's creation in 1988 by the UN, its role in synthesizing climate change knowledge, its structure as a scientific-political organization, the Nobel Peace Prize in 2007, its reports, and various facts about its categories, members, and affiliations.

First, I should identify different aspects of the IPCC to ensure the questions are varied. Possible areas include its establishment, purpose, structure, notable members, awards, reports, affiliations, and specific facts like the Nobel Prize. I need to avoid repeating similar questions and make sure each question targets a unique aspect.

Let me list out potential questions. For example:
1. When was the IPCC established?
2. What is the main purpose of the IPCC?
3. Which organizations founded the IPCC?
4. What is the full name of IPCC?
5. What award did the IPCC receive in 2007?
6. Who are some notable members of the IPCC?
7. What is the headquarters of the IPCC?
8. What is the significance of the IPCC's reports?
9. Which UN agencies are associated with the IPCC?
10. How many major reports has the IPCC produced?

Now, I need to check if these questions are covered in the context. The context states the IPCC was created in 1988 by the UN, specifically PNUMA and OMM. The full name is Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, and it received the Nobel Peace Prize in 2007. The headquarters is in Geneva. The reports are five major ones. Members include Filippo Giorgi, Kevin Trenberth, etc. The UN agencies are PNUMA and OMM. The answer to the headquarters is Geneva, Switzerland. The reports are five since 1990.

Wait, the context says the first report was in 1990 and the last in 2014. So the number of major reports is five. Also, the Nobel Prize in 2007 is mentioned. The headquarters is Geneva, Switzerland. The UN agencies are PNUMA and OMM. Notable members include those listed. The main purpose is synthesizing climate change knowledge.

I need to ensure each question is unique and answers are directly from the context. Let me structure the JSON with these 10 pairs, making sure the answers are accurate and derived from the provided information.
