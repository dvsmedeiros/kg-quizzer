Okay, so I need to create 10 question-answer pairs based on the given context and facts about British Satellite Broadcasting (BSB). Let me start by carefully reading through all the provided information.

First, from the context: BSB was a UK-based TV company that transmitted via satellite. It was incorporated in November 1990 to form BSkyB. Their first broadcast was on March 25, 1990.

Looking at the facts section, there are several RDF triples provided about BSB's ownership of various channels and films. For example, Galaxy TV channel, Now TV channel, The Movie Channel, etc., all were owned by BSB. Also, some films like "Hardware" and "Memphis Belle" had production companies linked to BSB.

Additionally, the facts mention that BSB was succeeded by Sky UK, which I think is part of BSkyB now. There's also information about their founding date (1986) and fate as merging with Sky Television to form BSkyB in 1990.

So, to generate questions, I need to extract key points:

- BSB was formed in 1986.
- They started broadcasting on March 25, 1990.
- They merged with Sky TV in November 1990 to become BSkyB.
- They owned several channels and produced certain films.

I should create varied questions covering different aspects: dates, companies they owned, successor company, founding year, etc. Each question must have a single correct answer from the provided data.

Let me brainstorm possible questions:

1. When was BSB founded? (From context)
2. What channel did BSB own? (Galaxy TV or others)
3. What was BSB's successor? (BSkyB or Sky UK)
4. When did BSB start broadcasting? (March 25, 1990)
5. Which company merged with Sky Television to form BSkyB? (BSB)
6. Did they own The Movie Channel? Yes/No
7. What was the fate of BSB? (Merged into BSkyB)
8. When did the merger happen? (November 1990)
9. Which film's production company was BSB? (Hardware or Memphis Belle)
10. What date marked their first broadcast? (March 25, 1990)

Wait, that might repeat some dates, so I need to ensure each question is unique and covers different aspects.

Let me structure them:

1. When was BSB founded?
   - Answer: 1986

2. What channel did BSB own?
   - Possible answers include Galaxy TV, The Movie Channel, Now TV, etc. But the user provided an example with "Galaxy", so maybe use that.

3. Name one of the channels owned by BSB.
   - Answers could be Galaxy, The Movie Channel, etc.

4. When did BSB begin its transmissions?
   - Answer: March 25, 1990

5. What was the name of the company formed after merging with Sky TV?
   - Answer: BSkyB

6. Which film's production company was BSB? (From facts)
   - Answers: Hardware or Memphis Belle.

7. Did BSB own The Movie Channel?
   - Yes, from the data.

8. What is the name of the successor company after BSB merged with Sky TV?
   - Answer: BSkyB

9. When did BSB merge with Sky TV to form BSkyB?
   - November 1990

10. Which channels were owned by BSB? (List a few)

Wait, I need to make sure each question is unique and covers different aspects without repetition.

So perhaps:

1. What year was BSB founded?
2. When did BSB start broadcasting?
3. Name one channel owned by BSB.
4. Who merged with Sky TV to form BSkyB?
5. Did BSB own The Movie Channel? (Yes)
6. Which company succeeded BSB after the merger?
7. What film's production was handled by BSB?
8. When did the merger happen that formed BSkyB?
9. Name another channel owned by BSB.
10. What was the main reason for BSB's dissolution?

Wait, some of these might not have explicit answers in the data provided.

Looking back at the facts, I see specific channels listed like Galaxy, Now TV, The Movie Channel, etc., and films like Hardware and Memphis Belle.

I think it's better to structure each question so they target different aspects: company history (founding date, merger), ownership of channels and content, etc.

Let me outline 10 distinct questions:

1. When was BSB founded? (1986)
2. What channel did BSB own? (Galaxy TV)
3. When did BSB begin broadcasting? (March 25, 1990)
4. Name the company formed by merging Sky TV and BSB. (BSkyB)
5. Which film's production was handled by BSB? ("Hardware" or "Memphis Belle")
6. Did BSB own The Movie Channel? (Yes)
7. What was the fate of BSB? (Merged into BSkyB)
8. When did BSB merge with Sky TV to form BSkyB? (November 1990)
9. Which channels were owned by BSB? (The Computer Channel, Heil Honey I'm Home!, etc.)
10. What was the successor company after BSB's merger? (BSkyB)

Wait, some of these might be too similar. For example, questions about merging and forming BSkyB could be combined.

I think it's better to ensure each question is unique and covers different topics: founding year, start date, channels owned, merger details, successor company, film productions, etc.

So perhaps:

1. When was BSB founded? Answer: 1986
2. On what date did BSB begin its transmissions? March 25, 1990
3. Which company succeeded BSB after the merger? BSkyB
4. Name one channel owned by BSB. Galaxy TV
5. What was the name of the company formed after merging with Sky TV? BSkyB
6. When did BSB merge to form BSkyB? November 1990
7. Did BSB own The Movie Channel? Yes
8. Which film's production company was BSB? Hardware (or Memphis Belle)
9. What was the fate of BSB? Merged with Sky TV to form BSkyB
10. Name another channel owned by BSB. Now TV or others.

I think that's a solid set, each targeting different aspects without repetition.
