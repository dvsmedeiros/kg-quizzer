Okay, I need to create exactly 10 question-answering pairs based on the provided context about Jacksonville. Let me start by understanding what information is given.

Jacksonville is a city in Florida known for its music scene and cultural heritage. It's famous for TheJacksonville Mercury newspaper and has some interesting history. There are events like music festivals, conventions, and cultural performances. I should use this info to craft questions and answers that cover various aspects of Jacksonville.

First, I'll list out different areas of Jacksonville: the city itself, its music scene, events, economic factors, historical facts, environmental concerns, tourism-related issues, social services, education, and community challenges.

Now, for each area, I need a question with a clear answer. Let me think of questions that involve specifics to make them precise.

1. What is the population of Jacksonville? Maybe around 600,000.
2. Are there any events happening in Jacksonville this year?
3. How much does it cost to live in Jackson?
4. Is TheJacksonville Mercury a local newspaper?
5. Has Jacksonville hosted any major music festivals?
6. What's the average temperature in Jackson?
7. Are there any environmental issues facing the city?
8. How many tourists visit Jackson annually?
9. Do we have access to enough educational resources?
10. Is there support for underfunded social services?

Each question should be straightforward and have a single, clear answer based on the provided information. Now I'll formulate each response accordingly.
