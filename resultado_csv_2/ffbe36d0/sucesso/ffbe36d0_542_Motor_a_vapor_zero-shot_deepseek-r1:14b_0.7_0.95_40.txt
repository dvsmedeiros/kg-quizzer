Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to create these 10 question and answer pairs based on the context provided about motor_a_vapor. First, I need to understand what "motor_a_vapor" refers to. From what I know, it's a type of steam engine used in trains, especially older ones. 

I remember that Stephenson's Rocket was an important early steam locomotive. So maybe that can be the basis for one question about who invented it or its significance.

Next, the function of each part is crucial. The boiler, for example, generates steam by heating water. That could lead to a question about what the boiler does. Similarly, the piston converts steam energy into motion, which might be another good question.

Efficiency improvements over time are another area. Early engines were inefficient because they lost heat and couldn't reach modern standards. This can form a question about their efficiency compared to later models.

The use of coal as fuel is a key point since it's what powers the steam engine. So a question could ask what fuel was used in these motors.

Safety valves are essential for preventing explosions, so that's another topic for a question and answer.

Water-tube boilers became more efficient because they cooled faster and were safer. That can lead to a question about why they were an improvement.

Steam engines needing water regularly is vital for their operation, so that could be another question.

The limitations of early steam engines included high fuel consumption and maintenance, which makes for a good question on their drawbacks.

Lastly, the expansion of steam engine applications beyond railways, like in factories and ships, can form a question about where they were used.

I need to make sure each question is unique and covers different aspects without overlapping topics. I'll structure each as a direct question with a clear answer from the context provided.
