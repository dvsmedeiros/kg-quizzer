Okay, I need to generate 10 question-answer pairs based on the provided context and facts. Let me start by carefully reading the context and the facts to understand the key points.

The context explains that civil disobedience is a form of peaceful protest against unjust laws or oppressive governments, originally formulated by Henry David Thoreau and used by Gandhi and Martin Luther King. The facts list various instances and groups that have used civil disobedience, along with some Wikipedia templates and categories related to the topic.

First, I should identify the main themes from the context: definition of civil disobedience, its origin, notable figures (Thoreau, Gandhi, MLK), and examples of its application. The facts add specific examples like the 2021 Montenegrin protests, the Serbian protests in 2017, the Committee of 100, etc. Also, there are mentions of various Wikipedia templates and categories used in articles about civil disobedience.

Next, I need to create varied questions that cover different aspects. Possible angles include:
- Definition and purpose of civil disobedience
- Historical figures associated with it
- Examples of movements or events that used it
- Organizations or groups that employ civil disobedience
- Wikipedia-related information (like categories, templates)
- The legal or social context (e.g., when a government doesn't meet population needs)

I need to ensure that each question is unique and doesn't repeat the same aspect. For example, if one question asks about the origin, another could ask about a specific example, another about a related organization, etc.

Also, looking at the examples provided, they include direct references to the context and facts, like "desobediência civil" and specific events or people. I should mirror that structure but avoid repeating the same examples.

Now, checking for possible questions:

1. Who is credited with formulating the concept of civil disobedience?
   Answer: Henry David Thoreau

2. Which historical movement in India used civil disobedience to achieve independence?
   Answer: The independence movement led by Mahatma Gandhi

Wait, the context says Gandhi applied it in India and Pakistan's independence. So maybe the answer should be "the Indian independence movement led by Mahatma Gandhi."

3. What is the primary method used in civil disobedience?
   Answer: Peaceful protest against unjust laws or oppressive governments.

But the context says it's a form of protest done pacificamente. So maybe that's the answer.

4. Which U.S. civil rights movement is known for using civil disobedience?
   Answer: The civil rights movement led by Martin Luther King Jr.

5. What is an example of a 2021 protest that used civil disobedience?
   Answer: The 2021 Montenegrin episcopal enthronement protests.

6. Which organization is associated with using civil disobedience in the UK?
   Answer: The Committee of 100 (United Kingdom).

7. What Wikipedia template is used in articles about civil disobedience?
   Answer: Template:Cite book (or other templates mentioned in the facts, like Template:Media culture, etc.)

Wait, the facts mention several templates. Need to pick one that's explicitly stated. For example, "Civil disobedience usa modelo de página wiki Template:Cite book" – so that's one.

8. Which category on Wikipedia is associated with civil disobedience?
   Answer: Category:Activism by type or Category:Direct action (since the facts mention multiple categories).

9. What is the purpose of civil disobedience according to the context?
   Answer: To oppose unjust laws or oppressive governments through peaceful means.

10. Which protest in 2017 used civil disobedience in Serbia?
    Answer: The 2017 Serbian protests.

I need to make sure each question is distinct and covers different aspects. Let me check for duplicates and ensure all answers are directly from the context or facts provided.
